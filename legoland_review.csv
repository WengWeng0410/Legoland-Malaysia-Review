2,Amazing time!,"Had a lovely day (24/4) here with my family. We bought the combo tickets to enter legoland and sealife. Since it was drizzling, we started off with visiting Sealife. Love the experience there. Less crowd in the day due to Ramadan, we felt like we had the whole place to ourselves. My daughter enjoyed her time there exploring different types of sea creatures. The seahorses were beautiful. It‚Äôs not as huge as Aquaria KLCC but enough for us to enjoy.An hour later we went to Legoland. This was amazinggggg! Again there were no crowds, we didn‚Äôt have to queue and whatever rides we went on, we were treated like vips, no, we didn‚Äôt pay for hot pass whatever that is, there‚Äôs no need for that now üòÜ. We followed what one guy reviewed, that is to start clockwise(to your left from the main entrance). We did all the main rides first then ended the day with some easy going rides üòÖ Plan your time ahead if you prefer less crowds especially during this pandemic. We had a big breakfast outside at 9am, went to Legoland at 10am sharp. Around 1pm, you‚Äôll see more people coming in but that didn‚Äôt bother us as we‚Äôve had already done most of the rides.Food wise, if you can afford the tickets, don‚Äôt complain about the food price üôÇ Bring mosquito repellent and umbrella! Great place for parents and children.",5.0
3,Unjustified sales of legoland annual pass,"Worst annual pass ever! Annual pass holder only can visit on weekend instead of 1 whole week. If the park‚Äôs access is only limited on Friday to Sunday, it shall not be labelled as ‚ÄúAnnual Pass‚Äù but instead, a ‚ÄúWeekend Pass‚Äù that shall come with a lower price.  Such information was not fairly conveyed during the sales of Legoland‚Äôs Annual Passes and I have a strong ground to believe that such sales was not carried out with transparency and justification. The sales staff at the counter was just mentioned the two block-out months which are June and December, little did the guy further articulate more on the weekly‚Äôs limited access.The park only open on weekend start from Nov 2020 until now.",1.0
4,LOVE LEGOLAND :),"My husband and daughter went during weekdays. Ticket was free below 3 yr old and government staff got 50% off. Went to theme park. Very few people and we could play our favourite rides 3 to 4 times! My daughter loved the boat, train and concert by friends. My husband enjoyed the roller coaster. Lego was everywhere including the fries!!! Staffs were friendly. Hand statizers were everywhere too. For the sea life, it was still unique as we could see lego with sea life theme. My daughter enjoyed the park. I guess can't compare it with  aquaria klcc as it was smaller but still had good experience :) my daughter keeps mentioning legoland til now!!!! You can have dinner at BIG restaurant in Medina mall after that :)",5.0

10,Fun at sealife,Nice place to bring your kids. Especially the sea life. My daughter enjoy it so much. Staffs were so friendly and helpful. 1 day is enough to explore the whole theme park but i got my annual triple park ticket for the price of one day ticket. So why not ? üò¨,5.0

13,just have fun,I visited this place a few months ago before the Covid-19 outbreak occurred .it was one of the best places for fun for young children and teenagers with family. but need to prepare yourself for long queues especially in the famous rides.

15,Need better covid19 SOP controls,"I see that many guests do not follow SOP, especially while queuing many do stay in the box. There were no one controlling those in queue. I also suggest the rides to be wiped after each ride, not only to get guests to sanitize hands before taking rides.COVID19 safety controls can be improved much more. The rides are fun nonetheless.",4.0
16,So awesome even following Covid19 SOP,The park follows all standard operating precedure of covid19. Not crowded even during Christmas holiday. Follow their social media and website for the latest news and information. We completed the Brictacular holidays Candy mission and get rm20 voucher on lego set only. Follow the SOP guys! Have a great holiday.,5.0
17,AWESOME!!! EVERYTHING IS JUST AWESOME!!!!!!!!!,"Had a wonderful trip with my family at Legoland Malaysia! All the rides are well maintained and clean. Staffs are all very friendly and my son enjoyed a lot a lot. He is 3.5 years old now and he preferred Legoland a lot more than Universal Studios SG. He don't remember anything from USS, but he remembers all the song, dance and characters at Legoland Malaysia. Full of great surprises for my son (free balloons, bubbles, badges, mini performance, bed time story by Princess at the hotel...etc). We didn't know much about Legoland Malaysia till we got there and we actually extended our stays from 2 nights to 4 nights in Legoland Hotel!",5.0

19,Best theme park hotel & best family place to have fun at theme park,"if you still doubt to go to any theme park during RMCO, please do a visit to Legoland Malaysia. this is our second time visit during RMCO and we feel very safe at every corner, from the hotel to theme park and water park as well. keep it up Legoland Malaysia is one of the safest place to have fun and play all day long. we glad that we experience Legoland during bad and good time at this trying times for all of us. Thank you Legoland Malaysia for always giving the best for all of your guest. Thanks to all the staff from concierge, bell boy to all the staff in the hotel and theme park / water park as well. Not to forget sea life Malaysia too. We wish you all the best and see you guys soon in our next trip. ",5.0
20,Everything is Awesome ,"First time here. Was a great experience because less crowded and we are able to repeat the attractions. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Sanitisation was done frequently and this had boost my confidence. Heavily pregnant, glad they have the electric wheelchair for rent. It helps me to move around.Food was pricey but it was tasty.Kudos to the young lady at the ticketing counter. When I went to collect our annual pass that we purchased online, she was very observant and noticed it was my son's birthday. She gave out a birthday badge and a small set of block as a gift. It really made his day. #kindgesturethatmatters",5.0
21,Wonderful,I love every part of Legoland hotel and park. The concept is energising. And the staff is very friendly and professional. Thank you for the wonderful experience. Hopefully in the future after covid-19 is gone. The lego will b put back in the hotel & park for more excitement.,5.0
22,Quick emergency response,"I can say that our visit to LEGOLAND was very short as my father had an heart attack after just a few minutes of arrival. So, we didn‚Äôt get the chance to enjoy the activities there. But, till today, I am very thankful for the service offered by the staff. They called for an ambulance and accompanied us all the way to the hospital. Couldn‚Äôt imagine how bad the situation was without their help. Thank you for such kind treatment. Keep it up.",5.0
23,Great without crowds!,"We came before the govt. imposed CMCO for Selangor, KL & Putrajaya. Due to Covid19, Legoland Park was a bit deserted. We came on Monday, no crowds & you can play/ride over and over again without queuing. The workers are nice & friendly. They followed the SOP strictly. Some of  the Lego statues, pavements are discoloured & needs serious maintenance. ",5.0
24,Poor Gift Shop Policy,"Date of visit - 10/10/2020.Hi I am Mr Ahmed. I really enjoyed the theme park, wouldn't comment much on it except for the super overpriced typical funfair games. The staff in charge was not very consistent and tried scamming us. Initially when asked whether we can do a practice toss at one of the game, she said it is not allowed as there are CCTVs, but when we lost the game, she offered us another 8 round of the games for the same price of RM30. Did the CCTV she mentioned earlier on just vanished???? I wonder if we agreed, would the extra RM30 gone into her own pocket? Now, my main concern is the policy of the gift shop.Before exiting the theme park,I went to the big shop at the entrance, and bought 2 t-shirts which can be personalised ( names printing etc). Was told by the cashier that we can come again tomorrow for printing if we want - probably it was already 5pm that they suggested so.So we came back the next day, asked to pay a refundable RM189 deposit each person to go back to the shop. Apart from that, maximum time allowed is 45minutes, and each person has to spend minimum RM100 at the shop - if not, the deposit will not be returned.So, what if a person bought a less than RM100 tshirt/keychain/ or whatever, and decided to change that because of wrong size, or he/she just want to add on maybe few items which in total is less than RM100????? Is it fair that you are charging them the full amount of RM189????? Where is the logic in this???? I understand that they may not want people to go freely inside and play in the theme park, but you guys could just give your customers special bracelet/tags for the purpose of changing/returning/purchasing goods, just think of whatever is deemed more convenient to you and most importantly to your visitors!",2.0
25,Fun for the whole family,Fun and excitement for the whole family although that most of the ride are for 6 yrs and above . Still both of my Kids really enjoy their time at Legoland,5.0
26,Family Trip,It was an enjoyable moment of our family especially for the children. We really loved Legoland it‚Äôs so beautiful. ,5.0
27,Everything Is Awesome!!,"This is the third time staying in Legoland Malaysia Hotel because my kids loved it so much. This round we choose to stay in the Premium Kingdom Themed for 2 nights, the view is so nice which was facing Water Park - really nice view. Room was tidy & spacious with separate bunker beds for the kids. My kids also enjoy the treasure hunt - never feel boring even though already play before (different themed room requires different code to open the chest box). The hotel is just next to the theme park, few mins walking distance..hehe Great hotel, the staff was so genuinely friendly and helpful. I was most impressed by the hospitality service of Mr Eddie (Reception Mgr). He is so kind and warm, accommodating to our every needs. Ohya, and also Ms Roziana & Ms Syida. I‚Äôm looking forward seeing them again next time visit! Thank you, Legoland Malaysia! Highly recommended to stay here guys!",5.0
28,Enjoyable trip but still need some improvement,"1. It was a bit frustrating when some of the activities inside the dry themepark were closed for about 1 hour. We truly understand if it was closed due to maintainence or renovation. But 1 hour break closed is considered quite long especially if we‚Äôre rushing to finish the whole themepark within 1 day and ended up there are activities that we didnt get to try, the price that we paid to enter all the themeparks is not cheap though. Instead of 1 hour break, I think a rotation of staff/crew members at the respective areas is much better and beneficial to the visitors.2. The themepark management seriously need to do something about the mosquitoes in the themepark. There were lots of mosquitoes and it is dangerous coz we noticed that some of them are ‚ÄúAedes‚Äù.3. We understand that buffet breakfast concept is not allowable at this moment due to the pandemic. Breakfast served was ok, but with the price that we paid (average RM20/person) I think the choices of food are limited and not worth the money since little kids didnt really eat that much. Perhaps the Hotel can consider to provide some complimentary snacks inside the room as well since the breakfast provided can be considered as ‚Äúsimple‚Äù or ‚Äúnothing fancy/special‚Äù.4. With the room price of RM700++/night (luckily there‚Äôs promotion for hotel room at the moment), it will be more nicer if there is a rainshower inside the bathroom as compared to the normal shower that the room has now. Almost every hotel with the average price of RM300++/night provide a bathroom with a rainshower.5. On our last day at the Hotel, there was an event for the Ministry. We understand that there are VVIPs. But to reserve and close ‚Äú4 elevators‚Äù for the VVIPs when they are yet to arrive is quite annoyed when the hotel guests (mostly families with small kids) need to wait longer since only 2 elevators are allowed to be used for the hotel guests and with the current pandemic situation, limited number of people could enter the elevators at the same time for safety reasons.Overall, we had fun during our stay but there are certain things that require improvement from the Hotel.",4.0
29,Helpful Staff,Really love this place. SOP regarding Covid-19 very good. The staf was very friendly helpful. Will be back to enjoy excitement at Legoland,5.0
30,Soso experience,Water park is good. With mco limited time and space. Can only spend 20 min at any atteaction and rhen have to get out. Have to queue again. The queue line not clear. Chinese tourist kept jump the line. Theme park look soo old and dilapited esp mini park. Most of the attraction and reataurant were closed. Better take the annual pass if possible as you may not be able to gonthru all the rides due to mco,3.0
31,Fun day out,A really fun day out in a well-organized park with friendly and helpful staff. It was pretty quiet so practically no queuing for rides and lots to do. Our little one wanted to go back again the next day but we will have to save it for next time. Decent food in the cafe too. A fun day out.,5.0
32,Awesome place for the kids,"This is an awesome place for the kids. They do have height limitation for each game. I went together with my 5 yo kid and 2yo kid. It is free for kid below 3yo. But she is still able to enjoy some show like friends, ninjago ride and some photo shooting with the hero! The 5 yo kid love this place so much. But it still better for those 6yo kids as some of the ride/game need at least 6yo. This place is stroller friendly and baby friendly. The food at the cafe is nice especially the lasagna. During the RMCO, their SOP for social distancing is well done. I love their family social distancing. You can see almost everywhere supply with the hand sanitizer. They will sanitize after each ride. Too bad due to this pandemic, they cancelled the exchanging minifigure.",5.0
33,Appreciation,"I do miss my Legoland during this Covid-19 MCO and finally I have the chance to check in.  While I was going to renew my annual pass, the Legoland administrative provided me the good news of the 3 months extended validity for my annual pass.  Also 20% off for all merchandizes that caught my attention to grab even more of my favourite collections.  This shows the sincerity of Legoland management for their loyal customer.Of all above, there is one guy wearing blue t-shirt (later found out his name is Mr. Francis) that caught my attention that always emphasize and remind us of keeping our distancing and self-caution of surrounding.  I'm glad that Legoland did a very good job of providing social distancing and hand sanitizer could be found almost anywhere.  It makes me feel confident whenever I step in Legoland.",5.0

35,below expectations,"not really up to my expectation, attractions are too common and not fun, and it's really hot weather for such theme park",3.0
36,Good sanitisation practice during covid season,"Good sanitisation practices during this covid season. All rides are sanitized after each ride. Hand sanitizer are everywhere. My 5yo is enjoying quite a number of rides while the 2yo is having slightly less fun due to age limit although he meets some of the height requirement. Weather is hot and humid. Face masks are soaking wet yet we salute the staffs who have to wear the mask all day long under the sun. There are no connected shade in the park or between the parks (theme park, water park, sea life). It is either you get toasted in a big sunny day or get wet during a rainy day. Properly it will be good to consider opening earlier at 8am instead of 10am. Lastly I would like to suggest Legoland to have more hand washing facilities at the eateries inside the park. Currently it always require a bit of walking which is not convenient for families with kids. This is especially essential in this covid season.Thank you Legoland!",4.0
37,Thank you LEGOLAND!,"It was a great experience, fun and we really enjoy our trip to legoland! Value for money! The legoland staff are so nice and friendly. Its covid19 year and they are strictly handled the SOP which u could feel the secure and safety. We are so HAPPY! thank you!",4.0

Unbelievable vibe and great place for a vacation! The theme room hotel is AMAZING!",5.0
39,Legoland Malaysia,"Overall great place! Both the main theme park and water park. The only point to mention is the ride called ‚ÄúAquazone Wave Racers‚Äù which has some serious technical flaws as not enough cushioning/padding on the metal sides. When the ride stops, it simply slams into the side and you end up being pushed really fast into the metal bars and hence you either injure your hip/leg. So many of our family members were hurt by this ride including myself and we were all following the instructions of ‚Äòstanding‚Äô. Someone should quickly inspect this ride before there is a serious injury.",4.0

41,Kiddilicious,"We were lucky to have experienced this playland before the outbreak of corona virus. I went with my wife and twin 6th YO daughters after arrivibf from Singapore by bus the other night. The place was great for kids. I wouldnt recommend the place for adrenaline junkie, but for family and kids, this is great. There are grande rides like Ninja-Go, Lego-Racer and Dragon Coaster. There are also interactive small rides, like riding school, fire extinguisher game, lifting games etc. The prices of food is also quite cheap. I went there not on holiday season, so there was very little queue for most rides. So I dont know whether my rating will be changed if the place were crowdy. All in all, I would recommend this place for families..",5.0
42,Loved it,I had such a good time here. I think it depends on pot luck but when I went there it was empty and I had free reign of the whole park no queues. Would be great for kids.,5.0
43,Good for Locals!,"Legoland is a dream for kids. Of course they enjoy.But what I clearly understood was that we should have used our discretion as travellers going all the way as tourists. I cant speak for other countries, but India and the southern part that I come from has enough and more such places for amusement and a visit abroad to a similar park should have been thought out. Yes, it is interesting for the kids, but it is a full day's activity if you are staying in KL, like most visitors do, and it can be extremely disappointing if most of the game are shut due to rain or so, like how we faced.  April 2019",4.0
44,Life size Lego... It's like a new world! (there's advice at the end),"The park was awesome. The lines were a bit long, but you won't get bored waiting in line! All the rides were amazing, and the waterpark was amazing too! The waterpark had well managed locker rooms. But I have some advice. bring a waterproof watch with you. The only problem I had there was finding out the time. I asked a lifeguard for the time, and he told us. Since we had to go somewhere else too, we rushed to get changed. But when I finally turned on my mobile, it showed that we were an hour early! Since I was chill, I went to the cafe inside the park and sipped on a scrumptious milkshake.",4.0
45,Awesome time had. ,"Just returned after a trip with my 7 year old son. The park was basically empty and we pretty much had the entire place to ourselves which was brilliant. He could go on the rides as many times as he liked over and over again. No lines for anything. He loved the Dragon roller coaster and must have been on it about 100 times over the 3 days. He was a bit disappointed that the VR headsets aren‚Äôt available on the VR roller coaster.  Staff are very friendly and helpful, food is cheap for a theme park although majority of the restaurants are closed. Only thing is there is not a lot around the area but the supermarket down the road is very handy. ",5.0
46,Theme park for lego lovers,This theme park is best with children since a lot of attractions are for them.  Although adult lego lovers will love this place too due to the creative creations out of lego pieces.  Some attractions are suited for adults as well.,5.0
47,Wonderful family day out,"We just went and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. The park was relatively empty, so we didn‚Äôt have to queue up for rides. The mini city was A M A Z I N G!!There was a selection of food and we ended up getting grilled chicken, fries, coleslaw, dessert and drink for about NZD$15!  Normally food in theme parks are very expensive. Would definitely recommend. My only suggestion is that if you‚Äôre not going to the water park you probably only need a one day pass. Also there isn‚Äôt much in the surrounding area. ",5.0
48,Fun times ,"My partner and I went to the main park over two days. Very glad we went as we had lots of fun on both the rides and looking at all the cool statues scattered about the park. There weren‚Äôt many other people around so we could go on the rides over and over if we wanted and there was basically no waiting time which was great. But it did mean a lot of the food places were closed and performances weren‚Äôt on. We were sad the main large roller coaster was undergoing maintenance, and for some unknown reason the VR coaster didn‚Äôt actually have the VR headsets to use!Overall all it was lots of fun!!Definitely recommend bringing an umbrella to keep away from the hot hot sun and also be warned that you get soaking wet on the splash mountain type ride ü§£",4.0

51,amazing but could do better,"Hi Legoland.Legoland is a must yearly-family-vacation for us. my son loved the parks so much especially water-park. however we had a bittersweet experience last year compared this year. my son, is an autistic kid. there are not so much ride we can bring him due to his condition. any ride that need adult supervision, we will bring him. Other than that, it is just sight seeing. we just want to make him feel happy. However, we really wanted him to try out one the of car ride because we believe he can maneuver the car with the help of booth operator. We did saw one of the booth operator help a kid maneuver the car.However, when we explained my son condition to the booth operator, she declined it immediately. what a bummer!!Fortunately this year, we tried again. we explained my son condition to the booth operator and he granted our wish! my son drove the car with the help of the booth operator. for us, it is an achievement. overjoyed! we also did his first license. thank you to the guys ( cameraman and booth operator)  who helped my son to complete his driving experience. your understanding and kindness, we appreciate so much. we wish, Legoland, can train all the booth operators to be prepared if there is some kids with disabilities want to have fun. make their life a bit colorful and joy.again. thank you! see you again soon",5.0

55,"New Friends musical, Aquarium kinda small, Staff friendly","Our second time here, still loved the fact that it is not crowded and very short queues in all rides. The staff at almost every corner of the land were friendly and helpful. It rained both days we were there so we didn't catch many rides, nor witness many mascots of festivities despite the approaching Lunar New Year holidays, other than a small booth that allowed the little ones to make a rat out of lego. Come to think of it - hope there were more wet weather activities, or else we felt our two-day tickets were kinda completely under-utilized as there was not much to do.The Friends musical was new, our girl liked it but it was just a mere 20-minute show. The Sea Life aquarium was small, and can be completed in an hour or less? The GREAT LEGO RACE VR roller-coaster ride was pretty exciting but the VR system needs to be upgraded, because the resolution was poor and felt like watching a show from the 1980s.",4.0

57,Family gathering,It was an enjoyable moment of family gathering especially to our grands children. Only with one setback. We were on the water park when my wife lost her gold bracelet.  Report was made to the management.,5.0
58,Fun and Expensive,"The theme park and water theme park were good. The staff in most places were very friendly and informative. Most events are good, some are under maintenance, few were boring. Overall a good place for kids and adults too. The events are not very challenging, so it is safer for kids. The theme park entrance is expensive, the food is too expensive like a small sandwich costed 35RM. Every event having a camera to capture our reaction and I expected one snap may cost 5RM to 10RM, but they gave shock saying 60RM. The experience is really really enjoyable and fun, only disadvantage is everything expensive, heavily overpriced. There are Lego stores which is not offering any competitive price than outside market, either same price or expensive. So, there is no reason to buy here from the stores inside. The big mistake is sea world, again overpriced and not special. Especially if you have seen other ocean parks, this one very tiny.",4.0
59,Excellent Choice for Kid,"Lego is the name as one of favorite kid stuff for sure. Additionally, Lego Movie is another theme as this will bring the kid to visit this place.We travelled this place during outbreak.  Then, we faced less crowded. Many food stations and some attractions have been closed.We bought only Lego Land ticket not combo with SeaLife or Water Park. I think it will be better to buy Combo TicketTransportation network to JB Sentral, Senai Airport, and Singapore is very easy.  Mall of Medihi is located in the same area of Legoland.  There are many fastfood (subway, burger king, etc), super market, starbuck, etc. This will make visitor feel comfortable during waiting for next activities such as; Bus to Singapore, etc",5.0
60,Most Valued for Money Theme Park,"We stayed 2 nights at LEGOLAND Malaysia Hotel and we spent a day in the theme park. At the ticket counter the staff mentioned that only Observation Tower was closed. The rest were open and available to enjoy.I went to Guest Service and claimed Birthday button for my always daughter and pinned it on her shirt.She felt very special and proud as almost all the staffs that cMe accross her especially the ride operators greeted her and wished her Happy Birthday.We didn't use the Birthday VIP Pass as there was no queue line after all. My birthday girl rode 10 rides. She drove a car at Driving School as she turned 6 that day and braved herself riding Dragon's Apprentice. We were so proud of her overcoming her fear and move forward. We then enjoyed Officer in Pursuit at 4D Theatre, LEGO Friends and the closing show too.We highly recommend LEGOLAND Malaysia for family with young kids. It is really a kids paradise.",5.0
61,Not suitable for adults,Most of the rides are for children below 12 years old. Nothing much for the adults to enjoy but the water park and hotel is something different and can be fun for the adult.,2.0
62,A very good side trip from Singapore!,Just a 1-hour ride from Singapore and you‚Äôll reach Legoland.  We really had a good time here riding the amazing rides because of shorter waiting time so much unlikely at Universal Studios where we were the day before.  We enjoyed Miniland where popular tourist destinations in Asia are featured in miniatures.  It‚Äôs just sad to note that only a few people go here.

66,WARNING: DO NOT LET YOUR CHILD RIDE THE BATTERY OPERATED JEEPS AND LED CARS OUTSIDE SEA LIFE CENTRE,"WARNING TO ALL PARENTS: Do not let your child ride any of the Jeeps and LED cars at the square of Mall of Medini (not part of Legoland) outside the Sea Life Centre. Our six year old daughter riding a Jeep had what should have been an innocent head-on collision with a LED car. Due to the LED cars steep nose her 25kg Jeep was picked up and overturned falling on top of her, including the jeeps seat and battery. She was trapped under the car and could have easily broken her neck. Wish Merlin Entertainment can have a serious word with the negligent Mall of Medini mall operators for keeping customers safe in the park vicinity although I must stress this is not Merlin Entertainments responsibility. We love Legoland and this was our fourth annual visit. The staff is super-friendly and the park is our favourite entertainment park in Asia, especially the Lego waterpark. See you again soon!",5.0
67,Theme Park,Great place for family and especially kids. Not over crowded during ( chinese new year ) so not too long que to play most of the theme park . Shop have lots of variety of lego too. Only that the wheater during that time was too hot and most of the places not under shade. And also the food & beverage was abit expensive .,3.0
68,Day trip to Legoland from Singapore,"We booked through Nusa transport Singapore. Our driver was so lovely and great with children. He was on time on both pick up and return trip. Our drivers name was Michael :) $200 return trip for transfers. Pick up was 8am and arrived at Legoland Malaysia around 9.15am. Pick up from Legoland was 6pm and arrived back at hotel around 7.30pm. We bought a combo theme park pass which included waterpark, sea life aquarium and the actual theme park (buy through klook as it works out cheaper than buying on arrival). (All parks are located at same location). The theme park wasn‚Äôt busy on the day we attended so we easily did all three parks in 1 day. Legoland was great for around 5 - 6 year old ages. My daughter who is 3 nearly 4 didn‚Äôt meet height restrictions for some rides. The staff are super friendly and we had a wonderful trip over to Malaysia for the day.Highly recommend Nusa transport and the Legoland trip if you are staying in Singapore.",5.0
69,It was great,My son was only 3 so there are a lot of rides we could not do.. But it was great.. I recommend two day pass though.. The Waterpark was the best thing.. And my son enjoyed the sea life too.. The only issue is that you don't have a lot of shade space..,5.0
70,Easy access from Singapore and good to spend a day trip,It‚Äôs a great place for fun and family time. Being in Johor Bahru makes it easier to access from Singapore. There is an airport as well in Johor Bahru with well connecting flights. Nothing great to do in Johor Bahru other than Legoland. Water park and adventure rides are good with a great value for money. Can spend the entire day in the Legoland with around 40interactive rides. ,5.0
71,Great Waterpark and Theme Park,"Great Lego place to visit! Not as many people, shorter ques and quiet a number of water slides available. The rides were very suitable for younger children and best of all, very rare there was a que on most rides!Shops had a variety of different lego releases; great for those looking for retired collectables. Only negative was that the food was a bit more expensive than expected. Expect to pay a lot on food. ",5.0
72,Good for family,Went to Legoland JB with family. Good experience for kids and they had a great time. Price could be cheaper,5.0
73,Kids love it. Though overall its small as compared to some other amusement parks,"Kids will love it. It's great to be in legoland with your kids and let them enjoy. Overall its a great and decent park, however its smaller in size and number of attractions when compared to disneyland or others. Also many of the rides has atleast 2-3 seats under maintenance and that created more wait time (sometimes).Aquarium was not that great and had limited interesting attractions.Does have a locker facility both at the entrance outside and also inside. However its not a cheap option if you have a big luggage to store.Overall a decent and great place to visit.",4.0
74,Worth it,I brought annual pass last year so I don't have to pay each time I visit. I went a lot this year with friends and it is absolutely worth going to.,4.0
75,Great for smaller kids ,"I haven‚Äôt been to other Legoland theme park so I can not compare, however, the rides seems to be a Little bit boring for my 8 year old daughter. She got more excited to see characters walking around and taking pictures Miniature looks amazing, got a wow factor in it. Waterpark: small, a wave pool, couple of rides and lagoon The big shop: we bough a giant LEGO from this shop, as we could not get them in our country, worth for a browse ",3.0
76,"Boring, uninteresting","It's expensive despite that it's a rather boring, uninteresting place, on top of that you have to walk under the hot sun or rain.",1.0

78,"Lots of ""Under Maintenance"" signs","We went there at 10 am & sauntered over to Merlin's Challenge which is a train that goes round & round. We saw there were nobody there & thought to ourselves ""How lucky! We are the first ones to ride this!"" We looked around for the staff. A guy appeared & said ""Sorry, this is under maintenance."" Ughs.... What luck... The 4D Cinemax was operating when we watched the first movie. However, we noticed that their seats did not move at all throughout the entire ride, which was strange. The second time when we wanted to watch another movie, we were told ""Sorry, this is under maintenance."" Mmm... Ok, guess we will come back later. So we did after an hour or so. Well, the same guy was still there & he said.... I don't have to type it here. I am sure you know. This time, a Chinese lady said ""What? Under maintenance again?!"" The guy just smiled sheepishly.Our first ride on the Observation Tower went without a hitch. But when we came back to do a second ride, well, the staff standing at the entrance said the ride was not operating due to weather condition.We went to the most popular ride which was The Great Lego Race & it was, YES! You guess it right again! It was under maintenance! So I asked her how long will it take. She said she does not know.We went to The Dragon ride & the staff asked how old is our daughter. We said she is turning 6. To which she replied ""Oh, then she can't take the ride. Kids need to be 6 years old this year."" ""What? But her birthday is tomorrow!"" We replied. ""Sorry, cannot"" came the reply. We were annoyed that we were turned down. Did she really understand what we meant when we said she is turning 6? There is no basis to reject us as the website said ""Guests who are in between 6-8 years old and 100 cm to 119 cm must be accompanied by an adult 16 years old.""Last but not least, I find the lighting inside all the toilet to be insufficiently lit; it was too dim & I did not like it.",3.0
79,A theme park with high standard ,It‚Äôs more suitable for older kids and teens as lots of rides have height requirements. Yet it‚Äôs still entertaining enough for my young kids. Baby care centre was fantastic especially for mum that needs to breastfeed. Balance of indoor and outdoor activities to cope with the heat in Malaysia. There are restaurants outside of the theme park if you don‚Äôt want to pay double the price for inside food and drinks. ,4.0
80,Theme Park and Sea Life only,"Our Legoland was a day trip we made from KL. While I understand people typically take a cab to Johor Bahru which is around 3.5 hours trip from KL one side. We decided we would take a flight instead and save ourselves being tired from the drive. This turned out to be great for us and we were able to enjoy our trip to Legoland.If you ask me the ideal way to go about exploring Legoland would be to take the 2 day pass and stay at their hotel, however in our case it was all  booked as we went on December 30th.We started with the Sea Life section which took us about hour and a half and then moved onto the theme park. There is a lot to do and typically there is a wait time for 15-20 minutes per ride so we tried to do the rides which my daughter would enjoy most. We were also able to watch their daily show - Ninjango which was great fun.Bought some Lego for my kiddo which she is thoroughly enjoying at home :)All in all, if you really want to enjoy the place - get the 2 day pass. To be honest if you are planning to do all three (including water park) you may need 3 days to properly cover the place.For further help these were the rides that we were above to do - 1. Driving School2. Boating3. Train4. Fire Rescue5. Ninjango Show6. AR shooting game7. Castle8. Water roller coasterand some more",5.0
81,Legoland in 2020,Spent 2 days n Legoland. One time visit with lots of photo opportunities.Not plenty of exciting rides.3 to 4 tides were good.Few were really disappointing like Ninjago and land of adventure activities.Waterpark was good.Sea life was good but small compared to KLCC aquaria.,3.0
82,"Not crowded, various rides","Visited during Christmas season, and it wasnt crowded here. Spent a whole day to enjoy every ride, start from some roller coaster, Ninjago, rotating tower, 4D ride, etc. There was also some educational session for Lego technic. Overall,  Legoland offers a complete set of entertainment for your kids.",5.0
83,Great place but slow service,"We had an enjoyable day visiting Legoland.  The facilities and rides have been kept up well, but we ended up waiting in line much longer than necessary because of the slow process of loading and unloading people from the rides.  The staff was quite slow at facilitating this process and didn't bother to fill all of the seats on the rides so we waited in the queue longer than expected.Overall we had a good experience and appreciated the play areas for our youngest child.",3.0
84,Paradise for young kids,"LEGOLAND is aimed at kids up to around 12, they do this really well. The park was very neat, although a bit weathered in parts. We spent two days and covered most rides in the three parks as there were no lines! We could have spent three days. Our 7 and 13 year olds had a ball. Food was within reason, but Lego and merch was overpriced. Definitely worth the trip if you have young kids, although more could be done to cater for older Lego enthusiasts. ",4.0
85,Good place for a quick weekend getaway!,"My friends and I went there for a weekend. It was super crowded as it was school holidays for both Singapore and Msia. We started with the dry park then went for a quick lunch before going to the water park. There is nothing much in the dry park other than the VR ride and the dinosaur themed one where you wil get wet (wear poncho and go if you dont' plan to change). The rides are family friendly and fun for all ages! The water park was fun with the slides, the wave pool and the lazy river. The kids pool is a must for everyone as the slides there are fun and meant for all ages as well!For accomadations, we took an air bnb which is much more friendly for the pocket, as the in house hotel is super pricey. There are mnay condos in the area of Medini, so an air bnb should suffice for a comfortable stay.",4.0
86,Good place for kids,"This is the second time here, not much new or improvement in the Theme Park. The Sea World quite small, spent 45-50 mins to explore all. We spent more time in Water Park.",4.0

88,Theme Park waiting to be forgotten ,"Sad to say that after 7 years since my last visit, there was nothing new or improved in this theme park. Rides attractions are still the same, VR googles are so blurred and old. It wasn‚Äôt too crowded on a Sat. This is only my second visit since 2012 but it‚Äôs not worth a third visit. ",2.0
89,Fun for kids but not for adult,Will be very fun for kids but maybe not for teens and adults. Dont forget to bring umbrella as it would be hot and sunny there. No long queue for the rides,3.0

91,Holiday ,"Well kept resort.Clean and neat facilities. Very helpful and friendly staff.Kids of all ages will enjoy  Legoland,  the theme park  aswell as the water park.",5.0
92,Year end trip,"First and foremost, we were delighted to have a chance to visit Nusajaya Legoland as wish for sometime. Here I would like to give some comments on this round of trip.The well known Legoland has adequate facilities for park patron and keep them busy for a day and i would say it is quite not possible to try most of the game in a day either for combo ticket etc. Definitely we will need to revisit a second time, especially when travelling with younger aged children, that would slow down a little while trying on the games. On one hand, there are lesser sun shade along the route which I think it would help during hot sunny day, on the other hand, some of the facilities inside the gents were being out of maintenance for e.g few of the cubicle doors were unable to be latched.Overall, it is still acceptable but another points to take note is the food prices is a little on the high side.",3.0
93,Great fun for family with young children,"Great place to visit especially if u have small children. We spent 2 full days at the different parks. The rides are not so extreme (unlike other theme parks and water parks). If u are an extreme junkie, the rides are ""child's play"". My girls (4 & 7yo) had so much fun that they're bugging us to return. Yup my 4yr old took most of the rides, at both the theme and water parks. Like I said, the rides are children-friendly =)Sea life consists of interactive activities for kids but the space in there is rather small. Especially when it's crowded, moving around in there can be rather difficult and uncomfortable. We had to ""squeeze"" a lot and navigate our way around strollers.",4.0
94,A superbly engineered tourist trap,"Legoland is a textbook example of a tourist trap. It promises so much, and delivers so little. It‚Äôs hard to imagine how a place of so little substance manages to attract visitors from far and wide.I have been here for the past couple of days and I have been struck by the lousy service and inability to cope with customer volume at the unacceptably few restaurants nearby. Also, inside the attraction outside food is not allowed, which encourages the food outlets inside to deliver slipshod service. The rides themselves are largely underwhelming, and it is not uncommon to queue up to an hour for a ride. Most of your tome spent within the attraction will be spent waiting (and waiting) on something or other. I will most certainly NOT be coming back. I couldn‚Äôt imagine getting much worse value for money than this.",2.0
95,Surely you can‚Äôt ,"What a magical place! We went with our 17 year old daughter and to check it out for our grandchildren aged between 8 months- 9 years. We will definitely bringing them back here to visit. I would only suggest packing a lunch as the food was expensive, as they usually are in most theme parks. We had a great day, enjoyable for both young and young of heart. Who doesn‚Äôt love LEGO!!!",5.0
96,Also fun for grown-ups!,"It has been about 20 years since I was in a Legoland and this one exceeded our expectations! We are a grown-up couple, but with our interest in Lego and our youthfulness we enjoyed quite some rides. So it‚Äôs certainly a great day spent with lots of different themes and rides. We walked counter-clockwise through the park, which seems great since the most thrilling rides (for grown-ups at least) are towards the end of your visit.We spent about 4.5 hrs in the park. Lots of cool decorations, but most are also due for upgrade (colours faded, bricks or parts missing).The food & beverages are expensive for the mediocre quality, but nothing you can‚Äôt expect in any theme/amusement park.We went on December 26th and it was surprisingly relaxed without too much people nor waiting times. ",4.0
97,Perfect for children aged 2-10,Our childrens age were perfect for the theme park and the rides and though they were very limited rides for 2 year old and under they compensated by having some playgrounds scattered around the park. There were airconditioned sections as well to cool down as it gets pretty hot during the day.,5.0
98,Great for LEGO lovers!,"Great for young and old Lego lovers alike. We went on an on and off rainy day and it was pretty quiet so we were able to get onto most rides without much of a wait which was great. Cool park and great to see all the LEGO displays plus do a ‚Äòbit‚Äô of shopping at the end.Just some things to note: we stayed in Singapore and had to go through immigration check which was a really long wait either side - approx 1.5-2 hours (and that was in a private taxi). Also, recommend you make this the last stop on your trip so you don‚Äôt have to lug all the new LEGO around!",4.0

100,Johor Legoland ,Good experience on LEGO display. Getting trip from Singapore early morning. Suitable for kids. The parks is clean and maintained.,3.0
101,Fun!,"We traveled with 9-12 year olds. The kids really couldn't get enough of the park. They especially enjoyed the Ninjago ride (so did the parents!). Lines were a bit long for some rides but most are worth it. We had our lunch at the market restaurant and I must say it was delicious and generously portioned. Towards the end, there were performances and a parade which was enjoyable too. Souvenirs were expensive though but expected from in a theme park, and they are good quality souvenirs. Lots of good facilities (baby changing stations, clean toilets, etc). We also went to the new Sealife and that was great as well. Overall a great experience. Highly recommended for a fun family trip!",4.0
102,Meh...,"Maybe if we had young children, our Legoland experience would have been marginally better... However, as a couple in our thirties, we were excited to nerd out at Legoland and were severely disappointed...- The rides are very basic and boring. - The attractions are outdated. - The 4D shows are corny. - There's no stamp out option to come and go as you please. - All the rides close if the weather even hints at rain.- The food is overpriced. - The souvenirs are not really unique to Legoland (you can buy the same range from any Lego store). Overall, not worth the money for the experience.The VR rollercoaster is the only good ride. We gave the park 2 stars, because it was clean, the staff were polite and friendly and there were hardly any tourists there at all so the lines had less than 1 minute wait time. In saying that, we cleared the entire park in 2 hours and then felt like we were just walking around the park grounds and spending time in the air-conditioned gift shops to get our value for money.",2.0
103,Legoland ,The theme park itself is not a bad place to visit. However considering value for money i would not recommend this visit. It was expensive and the park had only very few things that kids could actually enjoy. Its was more like a walk-in park type of place. ,3.0
104,Needs maintenance,"Place is getting old and dated. Some rides not functioning well. Need to introduce new rides and attractions as after a few trips, the kids outgrow it and it's dated. Food in the park needs improvement. No healthy options. All fried fast food which is overpriced. They should allow visitors to  bring their own food in especially with young kids. They can't be eating fast food and fried food the whole day!Other than that, staff are friendly, helpful and attentive. Water park lifeguards are quite good and responsible. We feel safe with the kids there. ",2.0
105,Good outdoor play,"It takes almost one hour to reach from City Square Mall,JB Sentral by public bus LM1 (RM 4.50/person). The waiting time for the bus was around 1-1.5 hrs during school public holidays in December. The bus schedule is not regular and may be terminated soon than stated schedule. Schedule looks good in theory but worse in practice. Do not expect taxi after 8pm if you have missed public bus when they terminate bus operation sooner than schedule.LegoLand itself is good for outdoor play for any child. During rainy season, many outdoor plays are terminated so expect rather long queue for all indoor plays. Children can finish playing almost all attraction in one day. So it's not worth buying annual pass. Do not expect a family picnic with own meal inside. No single snack/drink/bread/chocolate/candy allowed inside which is mind boggling especially for tourists from developed nations e.g. European. The staff make sure to search each bag for food items. Not clear if they also search for prohibited dangerous items. Visitors must hire a locker for RM 20 for a whole day. However, the visit is worth it especially for children.",4.0
106,A lot of room for improvement,Should have more staff to station in the park. Maintenance can be improved. The estimated time for the queue is not updated (always 5 mins). Good for children below 8 years old. The lego characters are just cute. Still worth to go for the experience or if you are a lego fans.If you have a child below 12 years old and you are visiting on their birthday. They can enter for free (please redeem the free ticket at counter) also he will receive a birthday badge (supposed to receive birthday greetings whenever staff sees him but only happened for 2 times) and a vip pass (for 1 ride only) The park is not packed given mid dec school holiday period. The hero pass is not really necessary if you just go for those popular ride in the morning. ,3.0
107,1 day at legoland malaysia,"we take 1 day pass for all three park. theme park, sealife and waterpark. kids really enjoy the rides and displays. on the day we went there weren't many crowds which really helpful so that we can take almost all the rides available.only if you have a kids below 3 years please ensure you have others adult accompanied with you.theme park and waterpark is the most recommended place to visit. sealife is not as attractive as the other two.",5.0
108,First visit,First visit with the family. Unfortunately it was raining but luckily the weather gods were kind to us and managed to use most of the facilities. First impression was that it‚Äôs mostly geared for little kids but then we met the super rides. Well organized and maintained. The sea world was not such a hit specially after just visiting Sentosa. The ticket covers the theme park and the sea world. Need to buy separate tickets for the water park. The tickets officers are very helpful and make suggestions to reduce the price etc. The water park is brilliant well maintained clean and lots of different activities for adults and kids alike. Well done to the Owners and management. ,4.0

111,Ok,Everything seem not well maintain. However it is not crowded compare to other famous theme parks therefore it is really suitable for families with kids. They get to play the ride for few times. Parking lot is really far and look unsafe as there is no security guard etc. ,4.0
112,Great for Lego fans and younger kids,Fun theme park for Lego fans. This is our second time there and my kid loves it. The queues for rides are short and there are fun activities to do like the Mindstorm workshop we joined.,4.0
113,Fun place,The theme room got my kids all excited. The quest to open the treasure box is an awesome idea! But it would be good to have a colourful and joyous message for the kids who open the treasure box and found that they are successful in their quest. Kids have lots of imagination! So make the discovery exciting for them :)I like the breakfast. There is variety for the young and old. I wish the hotel provides free shuttle to nearby shopping malls eg the Mydin mall and EON Bukit Indah.,4.0
114,Rebuilding the fun again,"As with the Legoland Hotel, we came back to the Legoland Theme Park because of my princess. And also that we had so much fun the last time. This time I was lucky cause I bought the Triple Pass Ticket and receive¬†the unlimited 365 daily entry¬†Triple Park Pass for one year. So we could go in anytime.¬†We had an early breakfast and waited outside the entrance very early. Point to note. They don't allow outside food and drinks into the park. The security will check your bags. But they do standby chiller lockers to store incase you brought anything. So thoughful of them.We started at the Driving School for my son. And princess took the Junior Driving School. Which she like so much so that we had to come back the next day.¬†Then we headed over to the Boating School. We had so much fun, should have heard mummy laughing.Then the Lego City Airport. Later to Pharaoh' s Revenge shooting baddies. Then to the much anticipated Ninjago Ride. A fun¬†3D ride. Wanted to go again the next day but alas there were some technical issues.Had icecream at the Burger Junction to cool down. Then a short stopover at the Duplo Playtown with a mini train ride. Took a 360 view of Legoland from the Observation Tower.As everyone was tired, we skipped the Lego Kingdoms. But we came back the next day. Here my wife and eldest son took a rollercoaster ride on the The Dragon. Later they took a ride on the Dragon Apprentice roller coaster which was slightly smaller.¬†We had lunch at the Asian Deli by the Lego Academy. Athough its was quite expensive but it was tasty. While the wife and the two smaller kids were resting at the Asian Deli. I and the eldest headed over to the Star Wars display. We were so engrossed the the beautiful Star Wars creation that we spend 20¬†minutes in there. Too bad this display is ending at the end of the year.¬†As everyone was tired we headed back to our room. Took a 2 hour rest and headed to the Lego Waterpark. We had a good time there too riding the Build A Raft river.¬†Our VerdictThe whole family especially the children loved it so much. Every thing is so clean and they took great effort in ensuring safety of every ride. Even the Waterpark, safety was taken care off. There were free flotation jackets for both adults and kids free if charge. And there were life guards ready at every corner. Will definitely come back as we now have a 365 daily entry Triple Pass.¬†",5.0

119,For Want of Some Small Maintenance... Otherwise Great.,"Lived up to its reputation as an international theme park. It has matured quite a bit since the last time I was here 4 years ago. The park has grown with new rides added.One matter that the park management needs to give attention to, in my opinion, is maintenance. Malaysia with its hot, wet and humid weather takes a toll on the lego models placed outdoors, exposed to the elements. These should be renewed or rebuilt or repainted / recoated (?) every few years. A lot of the models have lost its shine and some of the motorized features in Miniland are no longer working. Visitor facilities like the fans should be cleaned and made sure to be working.These are small details but ones that will get noticed.Not sure what the policy is with regards to bringing in own food and drinks. Mine was not allowed but I observed in the park that some outside food and drink did get through. Well... if you can get away with it, please bring your own as f&b inside the park is expensive... by Malaysian standard that is.All above aside, we did have an enjoyable day... albeit cut short by rain in the afternoon... but cannot fault the park for that.",5.0

125,Great place for kids,"The staffs are friendly and helpful. The kids really enjoy the rides and activities. We went on friday, so the queue was quite fast. We tried all the rides. Its fun for kids. The sealife park is ok but interactive. We went there 3 days straight and it seems like our kids have not bored with legoland yet. Will definitely repeat our holiday in legoland.",5.0
126,Excellent place to bring kids,My kids enjoyed it so much. All the staffs so friendly with Hi 5 everytime. Life guard at the water park im impressed. ,5.0
127,Good and fun,Many activities and big!!! Kind of need the whole day. I‚Äôve a 2 and 4.5 years old with us. The elder one can take many rides which require her to be 100cm and at least 4 years. The younger can only take the small train but her entrance is free. Won‚Äôt recommend the sea life unless you have a lot of time. Price is expensive considered we only spend max 1hour in it. ,5.0

Thanks for making this a wonderful experience !!",5.0
129,Awesome Time with Family & Friends .,"Went there for 2N stay at Legoland and not the first time we have visited and we still enjoy the hotel .We are very satisfied with the Hotel services . We had ""Majlis Penganugerahan Murid Tahun 6"" on last Saturday at Bricks Restaurant .Good Service from Legoland staff ,delicious and variety food . The event went smoothly  with assistance from Mr. Roslan ,Chef Hanafi  ,Mr. Syed & and their team.",5.0
130,Staff at Legoland is the best,"Went there for a 2N stay at Legoland. Entrance tickets are little bit pricey especially the Sealife. The sealife is small with no much to see, could be covered within half an hour. The most enjoyable being the Water park. The facility was clean.Having a two-year old kid means that we can‚Äôt take all the rides available but there are ample things to keep the little one amused. The best of all, is the people. I have been to many themes parks over the years. The staff there stood out being the friendliest and most professional among all themes park I have been to ( Disneys in Paris, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Florida, Universal Studios). They went over the extra mile to serve customers. Well done to the staff. Staff at ticket counters really explain to you how to get value-for-money for all the parks. Lifeguards, Brick shop staff, photo counter staff all were great!!Keep that up.",5.0
131,My first Legoland experience,"Went to Legoland with family on a sunny Friday. It was surprisingly empty for a theme park. Queuing was minimal on that day due to the limited crowd. Most of the rides are kids friendly, would recommend those with kids to at least travel there once. For adults, there are few rides that are quite exciting and if there are no queues, we get to enjoy the rides again without queuing. It definitely worth a trip for family with kids and fans of Legoland.",4.0
132,Have a great time here,"Overall have a great time here. But remember to bring mosquitoe repellent. Lots of mosquitoes. Most of the queues are short, the most 15mins waiting time. ",4.0
133,Water Park was so fun!,"The day we stopped in at LEGO land (4 adults, 2 kids) was soooooo hot. We did the rounds of the theme park and hit all the roller coasters. The virtual reality one was amazing, and also terrifying! Then we did the two in the castle. We rode the Dino island boat drop ride twice because it was good fun and we didn‚Äôt have any lines to deal with. The most fun we had though was in the waterpark! We paid an extra $50 AUD for an adult pass each, and we hit literally every ride/slide there. Was such a good day, especially in the heat and humidity. If you don‚Äôt deal with heat well - do the water park instead and save the theme park for a day that‚Äôs a bit cooler. The staff were really lovely to deal with. Everyone manning all the different slides were all very happy, very fun and have a good time trying to guess your accent. Just remember to get some Malaysian cash out if you want to rent a locker! Otherwise they accept Singapore dollars for food and drink.",5.0
134,The Legoland Experience,"Being at Legoland is akin to being at Disneyland. You get this surreal feeling you don't get anywhere else. Everything is larger than life, and will leave the less travelled awestruck. Lots to see and experience,  a large food court with a myriad of cuisines. We've come to Kegoland 3 times and still coming. Good job Malaysia!",5.0
135,Legoland Hotel 3D2N,"We drove in on Friday, half hour jam at Tuas Causeway. Started Legoland park around 245pm, left at 6pm when park closing. Kids tried boat, car, train ride, Power Tower, Friends dance, viewing tower. Miniland needed re-touch up. Day 2, 2hr Water park, hot sun. Towel needs rental RM35.wave pool‚Äôs floor at the beginning was rough, can scratch swim suit. Spent another 3hr in Theme Park, humid weather. tried spinning Ninjago ride, Lost kingdom (maybe too bright,cant really tell where I shoot), Beetle Bounce. 4D ride Hot Pursuit has water rained and cold wind blow too too too much on audiences. Freezing! Legoland hotel‚Äôs room main flaw is ants in the toilet. However, enjoyable trip. ",4.0
136,Friendly staff and not over crowded,Went on a November week day. The park was not crowded and the weather was very kind to us. The big fans situated all over the park helped as well.Staff were friendly and had a very positive attitude towards guests. They allowed my child to repeatedly ride on the rides and even offered to let her go again without us prompting.Only visited the Theme Park and had a pleasant experience there. The entry fees could have been a little kinder to the wallet though.,5.0
137,Bigger than I expected,We went on what felt like the hottest day of our trip and I really struggled in the heat however I did enjoy it but because I was so hot we didn't finish the park. We started where the kids could ride little cars (on your left from entering) I wish we had started on the right because we would have got a lot of the rides out of the way before it got too hot. I thought there was lots to do and appropriate rides for children so they could go on lots of them. Definitley a must do if you can get there. We were based in Singapore but stay in Johor for 2 nights.,4.0
138,"Great park for lego fans, but what age? HTey don't seem sure.","Not the first time we have visited, and we still enjoy the hotel and the Legoland park itself. The Water Park could use an update, but it was getting one when we were there, repainting the bottoms of pools etc. Very cold in the hotel rooms no matter what we did to the aircon controls. The theme park is fun, but I think it skews a little bit young for my kids now (10 and 12). the Bricks restaurant has a wide variety of Asiana nd Western foods, but there was an issue when we were there with water dripping form the air con vents and black mould around the vents which was a bit off-putting. I would recommend hiring a gazebo at the water park, airconditioned, and comes with a fridge and free wi-fi access (which was not working the day we were there, which was a pain in the butt) and a biutton to summon servers, however if you need to pay by card for your meals, you willhave to schlep to the counter anyway.",4.0
139,Miniature Disneyland ,I am not a lego fan so went here to simply have a day out. Used credit card to buy ticket and was given a 25 percent discount for doing so - great. It is an interesting park aimed more for younger ones and possibly could be a bit boring for non LEGO  visitors.  Went to go on Log Flume ride and was told I could not ride alone. I told them they should have a single rider lane so families can stay together and single riders can at least ride.  ( I own amusement rides). Staff was rude to me so I left. Had rude staff on two other rides so gave up. Definitely did not leave in a happy mood and will not visit again. Suggest staff learn from Disneyland- the happiest place on earth. ,3.0
140,Great family experience,A great family experience. The place is not huge but worth going even to see KL and other Malaysia sites in lego which are incredible. The roller coasters are not too steep but good fun and one is fine with Samsung VR and is really great. The Star Wars lego reconstitution is beautiful. The food inside is reasonably priced and the staff super friendly. Really worth a visit with kids. I also recommend the Jen hotel nearby. ,5.0
141,Everything is Awesome!,"We spent 2 days there (day 1 water park 4 hours, and day 2 theme park 6 hours). My kids 3 and 5 yo loved it very much. We got annual passes and we will certainly be back! ",5.0
142,Child friendly,Im with my family with younger children. I enjoy the rides and they have a water park and a hotel inside the vicinity. It was a good experience and the local food outside the park was amazing! ,5.0

144,amazing,the look was amazing and the rooms where biger that I expeked you should really go here to take a vaca. ,5.0
145,Legoland is average but waterpark is great,"Legoland is average with absolutely nothing to offer for parents as such(except VR ride and dino ride of the lost kingdom). Unlike Universal studios all the rides are designed for mainly 5-9 year olds. Another irking fact is the blatant commercialisation of the place. For eg. Water has to be bought- no refilling station anywhere in the park. In this day and age of environment consciousness, water was being sold in small plastic bottles only- no other option whatsoever.The water park was fanastic- lots of family fun and water slides.",4.0
146,Kids still loving it,"Been there umpteenth times within last 3 years and it's our second annual pass.The kids still go very excited over Legoland. And are willing to wait in the customs despite the agonising queue to clear the checkpoints. Otherwise the annual pass is really worth it and we will go in to JB whenever our schedule allows. If driving in, suggest to park at Medini Mall as the parking is only RM1 albeit it's open air. Else if you prefer shelter parking and a generally safer option, it is available at the hotel itself for RM50. Parked in the open air carpark, I think it's fine.Sealife is disappointing (can cover comfortably in under an hour) but the main theme park and the water park are the key attractions. Hotel generally comfy and the treasure hunt within the room excites the kids. Breakfast buffet is ok, though it is super crowded. Prefer nearby Hotel Jen (not an issue if you drive), as it's cheaper, cleaner, and food is better. ",5.0
147,Quite fun,"Probably I went during the off peak season and it is not crowded. No need to Q for all rides. It is perfect place for kids and not really suitable for adult if you are not lego fans.Unfortunately, the park is not vivid and is kind of quiet with not much activities happening. Although there are some booths (small and simple setup) for Halloween but is not attractive. The park does not have enough sign board or crew around to guide or provide help. It is insufficient notification about the timeline of activities.Last but not least, please keep up to maintain the park because each visitors are paying to enjoy and can't accept any bad shape in the park.",3.0
148,Awesome,"What a fantastic hotel to stay at! Our second visit here.  All Staff ‚Äúbend over backwards ‚Äú to help with any minor enquiry.A huge thank you,  to Anikul, Syida, Shima and Fadhir..  Extending another night was worth the money and absolutely no headache and worry.  They certainly looked after us.Hopefully we will be back!",5.0
149,Great for kids ages 3+ ,I guess you don‚Äôt pay for two year olds. But we did pay 600 MR for both my self and my husband to get in. It would be nice if there was more for littler kids to do. ,3.0
150,Good for smaller kids,"We spent 2 days at Legoland recently on a Sunday and Monday.  We were pleasantly suprised at how small the crowds are, very short lines for any of the rides.  The park is definately suitable to younger children (1 of ours is a teen) and is a small park with only smaller rides.  However as a family who love Lego, we still had a fun time.  We did the water park the 2nd day and again small crowds and lines.  Unfortunately we had to end our day early due to a storm which was disappointing, but with the parks being so close together we just went back to Legoland and did a few inside rides.",4.0
151,"Just 1 hour from Singapore, depend on immigration","really nice for the kids, Lego movie and game really hypnotize my kids to visit Legoland Johor malaysia... this Johor area is bit quite area rather than other Malaysia tourism area.. but easy to predict this district will be  growth soon, cause a lot of construction surrounding Johor... and Johor really closed to Singapore...",4.0
152,Five visits in a year,"Legoland - In our five trips (total of nine days) we‚Äôve barely had to queue for a ride. The VR Rider has the longest line - we‚Äôve waited up to 30 minutes to ride. It‚Äôs jerky and with the weight of the headset not recommended if you have neck/back issues. The car driving experience also moves slowly.  Ride maintenance - there‚Äôs a downside to the lack of crowds. While the park doesn‚Äôt feel rundown particularly, there are persistent issues with the rides themselves. My brother and sister-in-law got stuck on the top of the VR Rider, and had to climb down from the top with the help of staff after 10 minutes sitting in the pounding sun. The log ride is shut more often than it‚Äôs open. Ninjango and the shooting game have faulty controllers / randomly stop sounds/lights - it‚Äôs luck of the draw.Tip: Change into swimmers before you do the log ride. You‚Äôre going to get very wet...Food - we‚Äôve always eaten the pizza in Imagination (not bad) or the burgers by the log ride (pretty dire). Be aware that not all restaurants are open on all days. Just outside the park gates is subway, Burger King, KFC, Thai etc. Recently opened is Ben‚Äôs Independent Grocer - with good options in there too. Get stamped at the exit to come back into the park unless you‚Äôve got the annual pass. Coffee - there‚Äôs now Starbucks and Independent Coffee in Medini Mall a few minutes walk from the park. The coffee just inside the park gates on the left works in a pinch. Lockers - you‚Äôre going to need 40 ringgit for a large locker. Singapore dollars or credit card works for everything else in the park.Weather - it‚Äôs always hot. Bottled water is readily available. Sunscreen needed. Hats/sunglasses helpful. Waterpark - our routine was Legoland in the morning, waterpark in the afternoon. Recommend wearing a swim top over swimmers at a minimum - boardies for bonus points! Being a Muslim-majority country, many women are wearing burkinis. We found ourselves in the awkward situation of being photographed like zoo exhibits our first trip. Lesson learned!Sealife - we were expecting something like the Singapore version. However, it‚Äôs much smaller. The kids had fun. I liked the LEGO theme. We took our time, but only spent 45 minutes there. Lots of stairs, but elevators available.",4.0
153,Amazing Legoland,It was very nice for kids and still fun for adults. Tickets were a little pricey and there is a waterpark attached to it as well. Was a really enjoyable experience especially trying to build a giant lego floating raft and trying to ride it.,5.0
154,Love LEGOland!,I really love LEGOland! Many fun things to do and food is good but the ticket price is a little pricey but everything else is awesome but if you want a full experience you need two days so in the first day you could go to the park and the second you could go to the sea life then after that you could go to the water park. I would recommend you coming on Monday and Tuesday cause you won‚Äôt have to wait in very long lines.,5.0
155,A theme park without the crouds,"Our visit to Legoland was a great day.  There is plenty to see and do, with some great rides and many interactive displays. We only went to the theme park and that alone kept us busy.  To use the aquarium or waterpark would have required an additional day.  Croud numbers were low so there was never queue for rides, a refreshing change after having been to Universal Studios Singapore.  The staff were also very welcoming and accommodating.  Would definitely recommend a visit, even if it took a bus and some border crossings to get to.   ",4.0
156,Nice boat ride with little one,loads of ride and activity to explore.however for those with any kids less than 4 years old are not advisable to visit as many ride / activity are not suitable.,4.0

158,Not wheelchair friendly,"First need to sign a waiver when entering, then staff at every ride need to confirm if or wheelchair bound son weighing 20kgs can be carried on each ride or a flat out no as he can't walk due to his safety. Some ramps under construction, including popular ninjago, we needed to lift my son's wheelchair to gain access. ",3.0

160,Great place!,"Beside lush greenery, the Legoland was great fun. Just be wary of high food prices and  the heat, otherwise it's small enough to be covered in a day.",3.0
161,Great for young children,"We have been to legoland several times since it opened, with the last visit three years ago. We were shocked this time to see how few people there were in the park this time, over a children's day weekend. Certainly the park is not as fancy as Universal Studios Singapore, but it is certainly creative and entertaining. All the better for us, as we got to go on all our favorite rides nultiple times without queuing, but I am wondering what went wrong - when they first opened there were two hour queues for all the rides. The accompanying waterpark was fun too. Again, not as impressive as wild wild wet, but it makes up by the friendliness and the lack of queues",4.0
162,Great for Kids Age 4-11years,"We had a great time at Legoland and we stayed at the Hotel. This was a great time for my 11 year old son and 9 year old daughter.Here is a list of the good things....1 Hotel is clean and fun with Lego everywhere. the hotel lifts are really cool. we stayed in a pirate theme room and it is a good family room size. Hotel service and staff were good.2 Buffet Breakfast was good, although it was mostly Asian food with about 305%western style. So this might be tricky with fussy eaters.Not so good....1 the safety deposit box in our room was constantly not working and in our 2 night stay we needed reception to send someone up 3 times to fix it.2 Hotel has limited eating places and times. Fortunately there is a small shopping center close by with fast food outlets,3 the hotel swimming pool was pretty pathetic. It was very small in comparison to the size of the hotel. There were hardly any seats and there was no pool service for drinks or snacks pool side. The pool was nice and clean and there were lifeguards on duty the whole time.so overall i would recommend staying here and we enjoyed our stay. But it is definitely for families with children under 11years. Any older and they probably wont like it so much",4.0
163,Good rides for the kids,"My kids totally loved it. I went on a Sunday and there was no queue. My kids could easily get into any ride within 5 mins. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm going to be that lucky on a school holiday or Saturday. The rides are well maintained and each sectioned has a big play area, which my kids really enjoyed. The food variety was great as everything was fast food or processed food. Also was great is that you could rent stroller and that helped a lot going around the park. The only thing is that you have to return the stroller if you like exit to the water park. ",4.0
164,Looks like for Kids but has some thing for everyone,"we had gone there as a business group and our host has organised team building games inside the Legoland but rain played spoilsport. It has a lot of Historical and present monuments in small scale Models.I must mention the food spread and variety of food items, which was laid out during Lunch were very good.if you are with kids then one day should be spent here.",3.0
165,Overrated as a Theme Park Unfortunately,"If you've been to any reasonable theme park then you'll be disappointed by Legoland.  There are a couple of semi-decent rides in the VR rollercoaster, the Dragon and the 4D experience is quite good, but the rest only smaller children will enjoy.The lego models are amazing (as you would expect), but that's just it, of course you'd expect amazing lego models at Legoland.On a quiet day you could easily do the theme park (minus water slides) in 1/2 day.Plus side, the staff are all very friendly and helpful and I thought the food was reasonable given it's a commercial theme park (not cheap but not overly expensive either).",3.0
166,Worth visiting while in Malaysia or nearby Singapore.,This place is definitely worth visiting while in Malaysia or Singapore. Not that crowded when we were there and that is an advantage. Water Park has lots of choices for slides. Theme Park is also awesome. Sea Life is good for kids and kids at heart.,5.0
167,Everything really was awesome...,"We spent 3 nights here in September 2019 as our boys (6 & 8) are huge Lego fans.The Legoland Hotel & Resort is everything you want it to be, as long as you know what you're expecting to get. Bright, primary, colours; musical lifts; themed everything; tempting shopping opportunities everywhere; smiley staff; international buffet etc., etc., etc.It really was awesome.We spent a whole day at the theme park, where we never had to wait to go on a ride, and our boys were able to ride time-after-time without queueing again...a real bonus.We also spent a whole day at the water park, same story, no queueing, awesome slides, plenty of space to have fun.I wouldn't necessarily want to go again (I am not the target market by some decades!!), but I also wouldn't have missed the opportunity while we were in the area. We had a blast.",5.0
168,Worth visiting once,"This place is definitely worth visiting once. Look online for offers on tickets as they are very expensive. The legoland hotel price is ridiculous so stay elsewhere, there are enough hotels in JB. We went to the Legoland theme park, not water park. Really impressed with the minature landmarks made from lego blocks, it is worth visiting just for that. There were a number of rides, some were good, not that much crowd even on weekend when we went. The pizza restaurant inside is very good, with good tasting pizza and served quickly. Overall a pleasant visit but will not come again as it is only worth visiting once. You can spend one day at the theme park and another day at the water park and aquarium.",4.0
169,Good relax place with little crowd,"My 3 kids have an enjoyable time at LEGOland because even during public holiday it‚Äôs like only 40% capacity filled.No Long Q on rides, wet area is not packed.",3.0
170,"Not worth Time and Money, if experienced already similar international level amusement park","i went with my 8 year young son from Singapore during School term break holidays.Though didnt had great reviews about it, but as my son is in to Legos, so was very keen to experience Legoland (LL) since it opened in Malaysia.Booked tickets online directly through LL website. Can get discounted price (20% approx) if opt for tickets of specific dates. Also few coach online booking sites offer discounted prices. Glad didnt buy Annual ticket as its not worth going again.After lot of brainstorming regarding commuting, decided to explore city buses. Prime reason was to not get fixed with timings by booking coach buses and didnt had any luggage too. On return most of the coach buses leave by 5:30 whereas LL close by 6pm usually.Reached Tuas link MRT station at 7:45 am and boarded bus CW7 from nearby bus stop. CW7 takes you directly to Legoland. Tuas link MRT is very close to Tuas Checkpoint but one is not allowed to walkdown, thus has to take the bus.Being a working day and early morning - bus was all empty.In couple of minutes reached Singapore customs and cleared through automated system in a breeze.Boarded back on to bus (you can board any CW bus, irrespective of ticket bought of particular number) and reached Malaysia customs.Being a working day and early morning - it was all empty.Cleared Malaysia customs in a breeze.Waited 15 -20 mins for bus CW7.8:40 am - boarded bus CW7 and reached Mall of Medini (next to LL) by 8:55.So overall bus experience was great and luckily breezed through customs too.In fact reached LL an hour early, as it opens at 10am.As we approached LL entrance, didn't find it so exciting (comparatively)...To save planet, LL Map hardcopies are no more available... got to refer on your gadgets... Somehow found it inconvenient to browse such a big and detailed map on gadget, esp being an architect.As it was a sunny day, as per reviews -  targeted outdoor rides/ activities on priority followed by indoor rides & activities.Luckily all the rides were operational.Again Being a working day - it was all empty.... no waiting, no queuing... Explored almost all relevant rides and activities  with few repetitions too within the day.Overall rides are for younger kids... 10+ will not have much to get excited about.The Great LEGO Race - A roller coaster with VR option was exciting and something different - liked it.Miniland has lot of miniatures of landmarks of Asia... build out of lego.. very interesting.Rest of the rides were usual and not very exciting esp if have been to Universal Studios or similar.F&B is at various places but few were closed, not sure the reason behind.Overall space planning is a bit confusing and at times gets tiring.Return was also by CW7... spent 15 - 20 mins at Malaysia customs due to slight rush... else was all easy.In totality, a very average experience, nothing great to get excited about or look forward to... not worth time, money and energy esp if going from Singapore. Universal studios is far much better and worth every penny.",3.0
171,The stay is okay,"We stayed here for 2 nights at the Premium theme room- pirate.We got the best price from Matta fair at RM 1,600 for 2 nights. The room can accomodate 5 people. There is 1 king bed and 1 bunk bed with 1 pull out bed.The room is nicely decorated. Our son also got a surprise lego toy after solving the treasure chest puzzle.The downside of the room is;1. Smelly toilet, no hand soap.2. Dirty curtain3. Door out of battery, luckily Mr. Eddie assist immediately.Breakfast buffet need to be improved. Food spread quality is ok but cleanliness at basin is bad. Theme park and sea life is ok. Staffs are friendly. But, I think Legoland Malaysia can be better, merchandise should be cheaper. We got annual pass by paying 2 day entry ticket. Its a good deal.Overall, I think Legoland Malaysia can be better at same level with Legoland USA and Japan.We stayed 2 nights, our son thought he can get 2 times treasure chest puzzle, but no.Thank you.",3.0
172,Funny time with friends,Legoland not only for kids it make me so much enjoy with friends at theme park and water park we went both side many exciting from start until end of the day if you come to JB should visit here.,5.0
173,Good school holiday destination ,"Big open place but may need some up keeping at some areas. Many different rides to cater to kids of different age group. Also, a couple of rides for adults. Not many shelters to take cover during rainy day nor shield from the sun. Overall a good place to keep kids occupied for the day. If too warm take family over to the water park to cool down. The slides there‚Äôs are amazing for older kids and adults and also an area for the younger ones. A huge lazy river that may get really crowded during peak holiday season. Again, food quality and taste very disappointing, better to bring your own sandwich and loads of water. Loads of sunblock as shelter or covered areas is limited.",4.0
174,Good & friendly staff,"Thanks to Front Office team, Ms Nadeea, Ms Roziana & Audrey did a good job during check in and check out. They giving a nice smile & good information about hotel & park. Restaurant staff also giving 5 star service during dinner, breakfast and lunch. Food is very good.",5.0
175,Expensive park,"Park has strict rules about consuming food from outside. However, park‚Äôs food is usually all fried or too sweet for healthy consumption, not to mention also, super expensive.Staff WILL get your orders wrong so it‚Äôs good for you to check so that you don‚Äôt get shortchanged.Rides wise are not well maintained, but still suitable for young children.Plenty of queue cutters (especially kids) who would pretend that someone is queueing for them in front.The park has made good efforts in ensuring that the toilets are clean and dry. Well done.",3.0

177,Excellent Place to Come in September,"Visited Legoland during the September school holidays in Singapore and was surprised to find it rather empty. The queues at the rides were very short, and we managed to try most of the rides within 3 hours. Food options were pretty good and affordable, along with many drink stalls throughout the park. Spent a fortune at the game stalls without winning anything. The staff at these stalls would offer more tries and a cheaper price, but do resist these seemingly tempting offers. My advice is to avoid them so that you can save the money for gifts at the Lego store near the entrance :)The rides that we enjoyed (and worth the queues) included Ninja Go, VR Technic and boating. ",4.0
178,Legoland,"We visited while on holiday from Singapore, booked through WTS travel from under the Singapore flyer, well organised easy transfer. The park was very quiet on the weekday we went and there were no lines whatsoever. The rides were good and lots of fun was had.  Worth a visit if the young ones are into Lego",4.0
179,Legoland Go,"Visiting on a weekday is a relatively good experience with short or no queue on most rides.  However, several ‚Äúrides‚Äù were not well maintained e.g. Lost Kingdom Adventure has many ‚Äútargets‚Äù not lit up, Ninjago has several ‚Äúsensors‚Äù which were not working properly and Lego 4D Movies have not changed any of its shows for several months.

She was thrilled with the arrangements of Mascot Adventure, Magician Daniel Loo & the Legoland team. Thank you for the great fun! We will be back as we signed for annual pass.",5.0
181,Bad maintenance - Theme Park,"The theme park shows signs of bad maintenance and is running down. A lot of the Lego run down colours and dirt marks. The ""Miniland"" especially, parts not moving, figures broken, damaged, dirty, roads damaged. Some of rides need repainting as the colours are not  bright as LEGO supposed to be. ""Merlin's Challenge"" has spider webs on Merlin! Need more fans and trees from the heat!",2.0
182,Strict age/height limits cause headaches ,"We came in Sept 2019 during the week- park was near deserted!! Made it easy to walk on to rides but strangely although the park is aimed at young children (most rides appeal to age 3-8 yo) there are inconsistent strict height AND age limits for everything! So you may be old enough but not tall enough and vice versa. Ideal for family with two adults and two kids, with 3 kids one had to wait alone or we had to swap on and off rides as our kids aged 1-6 couldn‚Äôt sit alone even on the tamest kiddy rides. Whole park needs a good clean up, food options are awful, food not fresh and western food weird ie turkey toast carbonara, chicken sausage donut üò≥. Kids had fun, water park more fun than Legoland itself, but we won‚Äôt return. One day is plenty.",3.0
183,Nice place to spent time with family,We went to Legoland Johor Bahru Malaysia on 21 Feb-22 Feb 2019. There are a lot of playing ground which are interested and suitable for our child. Fortunately we went there during weekday therefore we can try most of the rides since there was not so much visitor. It is recommended place to be visited with family.,5.0
184,Great family fun!,"We love Legoland Malaysia. There are so many things for kids ages 2-12 to do. We love the misty covered playground for toddlers, the indoor air-conditioned LEGO car making area, and the train and boats in the main park. At the water park, there is a HUGE wave pool, a fun playground, and adventurous slides for bigger kids. The aquarium is well done with thoughtful LEGO touches and it's a nice little break from the sun in the other parks.",5.0
185,2 days Legoland adventure ,"We‚Äôre a family group of 9 pax and we‚Äôre traveling from Singapore using 2 starex vans. We entered immigration and customs border and the line is quite heavy. Right after the border control it‚Äôs about 20 minutes drive to Legoland. The property was quite old fashioned themed park and so is hotel. There are 3 restaurants; japanese, all day dining and italian restaurants. All are very expensive restaurants. The rooms are excellent for kids. Bunk beds are available next to the masters bedroom. All floors have their own theme designs. Breakfast is like a riot on going. Sooo many people many coming from mainland China. ",4.0
186,A must visit with your Family,"all three attractions are good, Water Park needs only around 3 hours to cover the activities, the legoland needs a day as there are many activities and rides to cover. All round the park there are toilets and eating places. Ideal place for the kids and adults to enjoy as a family. ",5.0
187,First time visit,To my kids they love it. The theme park let my elder child win 2 giant pandas so they will thrilled. The water park we didnt play much because of my little child age so there are restriction of the height. But they enjoy the kids pool spending at least 3 hours there. We did not go the aquarium though. But we bought the annual pass so will be going back again. Because the annual pass is about RM50 more than the single pass. We stay near so easier for us to go back. We did not stayed at the legoland hotel as we felt it was too expensive. We rather spend the money on other things. We have our own transport so going there was not a problem. Overall it was a good experience.  ,5.0

189,Great Family Holiday,"we took our 11 and 8 year old grandchildren to Legoland for 1 night and had a fantastic time. So much for them to do and we joined in, the water slides are really good, plenty of different things to do, rides, aquatic walk through, play with fire engine hoses, build (and buy) Lego, we arrived midday Thursday and left Friday late afternoon.Booked a late checkout and a Birthday session, this was fantastic, they decorated the room in stacks of balloons happy birthday banners, built a Lego Block with the birthday name inside it for you to keep, special treats in the Superior Themed room that we chose and then someone dressed up as a Lego Chef and brought a birthday cake to the room and a few staff sang happy birthday, well done Legoland!Was a bit dubious about eating in the Legoland restaurant but we did and really enjoyed the food and atmosphere, the staff were very attentive as well, nothing to complain about, BUT you must always be prepared for the humidity and sun in Malaysia, so plenty of sun block and hydrate all the time, a fun time, worth the extra to stay until later in the day, although I feel 2 nights would be more than enough.",4.0

Although my 3 year old did not meet the age and height requirement for some rides, we still found enough to do. My 6 year old could do almost all of the rides and we spent the whole day at the park, from 10:30am til the closing time show at 6pm.   ",5.0

Service is 3-4 star. No one to care you and you are your own.Whole LEGO land is good with small Aquarium. Smaller than Singapore SEA. It is not colorful.",4.0

The little ones will have fun with the rides, and don't miss the driving school circuit - for the toddlers and the older children!It is also recommended to get the day pass to visit the 3 parks - Legoland, Sea life and WaterPark.

195,Legoland Visit,"Book a bus to and fro from WTS travel agency. Surprisingly, on the way there it takes about 2hours and on the way back it takes only 1 hour. Brought a 2 day combo ticket and upgraded it to annual pass, I would suggest to just purchase the annual pass online to save time. Other advantages with the annual pass includes 25% off on a single ticket, 10% off on food and 20% off at the Lego shop. On the attraction, it wasn't overly crowded as compared to the Singapore attraction. There was not queue at the main entrance apart from a quick security bag check. Take note to bring a along sunscreen and drink a lot of water to stay hydrated as it can get really hot during the day time. The details on the maps are small as I would suggest to print out a map before reaching there. For the water park, bring along extra clothing and swimwear, becareful as some of the water rides can be really rough.For the hotel and accommodation, can use Airbnb to book the afinti residence, the puteri harbour Jen hotel which has a bus to and fro to Legoland. Somerset Medini is a ten minute walk to Legoland. However, note that the check in timing is strictly after 3pm, however it is possible to deposit the bag there if going to Legoland as the small locker cost about 20rm and the big locker cost about 40rm for a day of usage. For payment at Somerset hotel, it is solely via payment on the hotel itself. There wasn't much to do nearby apart from the mall of medini which is mainly two rows of restaurant and a few convenience store.",4.0
196,A Good family trip,   We had a wonderful day out at this wonderful place we simply hired out a company tour company car from Singapore to Johor Bahru. The hotel was charging too much for each way so I used this company called J&C Travel SDN BHD they gave me a very good package and price for pick up and tickets to the Legoland.     We had purchased a one day combo ticket with them to the Legoland water park and Legoland theme park both the places are located right next to each other. Adult was 88 SGD and child was 68 SGD. we had done a day trip and went there very early morning with. It‚Äôs our kids. We managed to do both the places and had a really good time. It is quite easy to go to Johor Bahru isn‚Äôt too far from orchard street as well as Sentosa island so depends where ons is staying but either way it is possible.     The transport company charged us about 220 SGD for taking us there and back in a beautiful 7seater Van Toyota Innova with professional drivers with proper identities etc.     We did the Legoland theme park first and managed to complete all the rides and everything for half the day. The park had a Legoland mini place where they have cities around the world all Made out of legos it was wonderful the kids loved it. from the rides to the sound effects the display shows and the souvenir shops totally worth it. I would definitely recommend this to anybody going to Singapore with small kids to try this out.  ,4.0
197,Avoid Hero Access ,"The park is nice very much similar to other LEGOLAND however avoid buying the Hero Quick Pass in LEGOLAND Malaysia it is totally useless, the staff on rides are not trained on how to process Quick Pass you will loose the value of your money.Their management are very nice and helpful they provided us all the support we needed.",3.0

206,Rent a locker but still lost passport and all luggage belongs,"Our family with young children (10 and 4 age) have visited LEGOLAND Malaysia from 17-July. We have enjoyed inside the park until 4 PM, I decide rent a locker (211) to keep my backpack (4 passport, and DSLR/Lens, wallet etc...) in Technic Area to play a ride. That's the only way and safety for us can play a ride/roller coaster.At 5 PM I come back to get my backpack, Open the locker and... it's empty (nothing inside). I have already reported at Guest Services and LEGOLAND had told me made a police report. On the next day (18-Jul) we do everything by ourselves, LEGOLAND didn't contact or support anything to us. Up to now (6 -Aug), i send a lot of many email to Legoland but doesn't have any feedback goodwill from Legoland:We very disappointed with Legoland. Some issue with Legoland:	What's happening with our items? 	Did Legoland check on CCTV. We don't believe you don't have enough CCTV to check or give helpful information.	Locker area is a sensitive area. Why Legoland don't have CCTV at here?	What Legoland's responsibility with us?	The looker can opener too easily by your staff, hence I don't exclude it opened by your staff.	Request LEGOLAND compensation for damages that occurred to us.",1.0
207,Everything was awesome,"Went on a weekday, which I'd strongly recommend to avoid the queues. The opening show was LOUD! We went with  6 and 9 y/o boys and they had a ball. Did Ninjago land and the driving school, the train ride and the boat rides and the VR rollercoaster, and could have spent more time but pressed for time. It was hot but there was ample shade with misters and fans, and lunch was at the Firestation bistro, which was fine for the kids. Then we did the adjoining waterworld which was massive fun. The boys were exhausted, and really would do it again over 2 days next time. Recommended for under 10s. I cant see much older kids getting as much fun out of it.",5.0

209,"Great water park, no gluten free food","We wanted to visit the water park as we have had Legoland passes in the uk for many years and we thought it would be different to see the water park. We got tickets to just the water park, as if we also wanted Legoland tickets we had to get aquarium tickets, which we did not want. The tickets are not cheap, and you are not allowed to take your own food in. According to the website they cater for different dietary needs including gluten free, however in reality they only do vegetarian as an alternative. The staff did not understand gluten free at all, and as my daughter is a coeliac she had nothing to eat all day, except a few pieces of watermelon. 8 hours without any food in the heat is not good for a child, and spoiled her enjoyment of the day. Legoland need to make sure that if they are banning food to be taken in that they can provide for dietary needs, The water park itself is good. There is a pool that you can swim and cool off in, some sliders and a raft river, as well as drench towers and a small duplo area. We would visit again tomorrow, but due to the food problems will be unable to. Also a ticket combining the water park and lego Park would be good without having to pay for the aquarium too.",3.0
210,Great for a young family,Easy and enjoyable day at Legoland Malaysia. Lots of good rides for a family although I think it is slightly more suited to children under 10. In saying that the Lego Racer VR coaster may just be the best ride I have ever been on. You're transported into a Mario Kart type scenario yet you're on a roller coaster. Another positive was the Water Park next door. The rides there were not too scary and the queues almost non existent so plenty of slides for everyone. Getting there from Singapore was quite easy too. We hired a driver through Nusa Transport. They took us from door to door and return.Bit of a downside with Legoland was that if you wanted to do the park and the water park you also had to pay for the aquarium which we had no interest in and not enough time. Also there were a few rides that weren't working.Overall though a great day.,4.0
211,Still fun but it's tired,"Went with bestie, her 13 year old and hubby and my other half.

212,Fun for kids all ages,"We stayed in the Legoland hotel next door so arrived at the dry side of Legoland just after lunch and were pleasantly surprised to find no queues.  The park was clean and staff were friendly.  Half day was enough for us to walk around the dry side.There were rides for all age groups and my son even tried his first rollercoaster!  There were a few rides closed for maintenance and the website didn't reflect them to date, which was a bit disappointing. By far the favourite for our family was the Ninjago Puppet Show, amazing skill, graphics and fun story to follow, highly recommended.Typical theme park food, a bit overpriced but that's a given.Waterpark was great fun.  All the tube rides were closely monitored by lifeguards which gave me great reassurance.  Lots of places to keep your thongs at the foot of each ride.  Nothing was too high or had a long wait time.  Could have spent all day here but again 5 hours was enough for us.  Only disappointment was the wave pool, nothing like in QLD.  Towel hire was available and offered deposit refund on return.

The resort is located on top on a mountain. Nevertheless, it was great experience.",4.0
220,Great day (or two) out with the kids,"This is our 4th visit to LEGOLAND theme park.  In fact we've bought the annual passes for the whole family.  A couple of years back, the park looked dilapidated and falling apart from poor maintenance.  In fact it looked like a ghost town with few visitors.We visited in June, and came back again in July.  The place feels like it's under new management.  There has been a lot of improvements.  New paint at the attraction entrances, colourful new bins.  The staff seem more motivated and energised.  Many of the play areas that were ""under maintenance"" have been repaired e.g. the wall climb outside the Ninjago ride.  The train that used to be perpetually ""under maintenance"" is busy chugging along the entire day.2 big additions are very noteworthy, and they look very expensive to produce.  Every evening there is a live song and dance show at the main entrance.  And it's a big show, not to be missed.  Starts 545pm.  A great way to end the day.The other is the Lego Friends live show, where practically all the performers are foreign talent.  They perform 4 times a day, with meet&greet after each show.  Must be quite expensive for LEGOLAND to bring this show in.The waterpark is always a sure hit with everyone, young and old.  However, it needs better cleaning and maintenance.  Specifically, the eating/waiting area by the lazy river is dark with algae.  Quite unpleasant to be walking bare feet on the dirty floor.  Also there needs to be more showers, as this is a waterpark after all.  The TV by the wave pool has been busted for months.  My skin feels itchy after an hour in the water -- needs better cleaning.  Staff is just as friendly and fun, so kudos for keeping the spirit up.Sealife is a little ho-hum.  A nice place to visit, but nobody will go all the way there to see the fish.  Too much of the decorations are fake.  Fake coral, fake rocks, fake trees etc.",5.0
221,Even the adult  become child here,"It is a wonderful theme park. When we are there we forget our age and start behaving like kids while taking part in the games. Kids will like this park very much as they are many Lego themes to choose. My granddaughter enjoyed the car driving.

225,Park safety concern and poor communication,"1st - my family was playing the fire brigade station. The car that my wife was in broke down. Call for help, all the station staff were chatting away with staff from other station. Call out several times, pretend not to see. Then, 1 staff just come over to tell her to keep pumping and just walk away, without checking the authentic of the problem. This is a serious breach of safety. If generally most of your staff behave this way, you will be waiting for fatal accident to happen due to negligent. I would say 6 out of 10 of ur Station staff are not friendly and portrait the impression of purely work for time to pass.2ndly, I called for in room dining. The CSO confirmed my order. Repeated to her to make sure it was registered and she inform me it will be delivered in 45mins. 20mins later from my confirmation, she called again saying that some lady from my room ordered steriliser which I said nope, there's no lady in my room that ordered that. Then, she called again and hang up, she called again to reconfirm that I ordered seafood fried rice. This time, my son was waken up. I said yes. I asked her when will it be delivered. She told me 45mins later. I rebutted her. She apologise. 5mins later, seafood fried rice is delivered.Review on Hotel:1. Food is average.2. Its like a maze3. Information signs and help are not professfonalReview on park. 1. Please check through ur equipment. We will at the bounce and the safety belt is not working.

227,"Rules are rules, aren't they?","Staff managing The Boating School are in need of a serious overhaul. Understanding the parks own rules (and following them) would be a start! A red sign next to them clearly stated no reserving of place in queue, including toilet breaks. A pretty easy rule to understand and follow to keep things running smoothly in a theme park. Yet when the group of 2 adults in front of my family became a group of 10 adults after their ""toilet breaks' and I politely pointed out to them the rules which are clearly stated on the board, NONE of the immediate staff were interested in acknowledging these rules when an altercation occured. It's like they were a group of mutes. NONE of the immediate staff wanted to stop the man from violently shouting abuse at me and my family when I confronted him about sticking to the rules. NONE of the immediate staff stopped the group in front of us from going on the rides but in fact asked my family to step out of the queue to further discuss this matter. So we discussed. The Park Manager Charles was called in to ""help. At first his way of helping was to ask for an apology from both parties. Um, what am I to apologise for exactly? Waiting in the queue?  Meanwhile, as I am trying to explain to Charles what I think would have been a fair outcome, the group in front of us are happily enjoying the ride they had ""queued"" for while my children are standing next to me, not on the ride. Go figure. To rectify our situation, we did get assigned a guide to take us around the Park for a couple of hours which meant we could jump to the front of the line. He was amazing! As well as the lady who came out to diffuse the situation and ensure our children were happy and able to enjoy the rest of their day. I didn't catch their names but I do want to say a special thank you to them. If it weren't for you, this experience at Legoland Malaysia would have left a very sour taste in my mouth. Tip for Management - if you want people to stick to your Park rules, train your ground staff to stick to them also. Don't reward disorderly behaviour. Keep it FAIR and JUST.",2.0

Not too much queuing in the park so we went on lots of rides. Quite long wait for food in the park at times - up to an hour for lunch.  Also at the Legoland Hotel restaurant I didn't really enjoy the food as it was all lukewarm or cold - the bain-marie's did not keep the hot food hot enough so it wasn't nice. We came on a coach from Singapore and the whole border control process is crazy! The coach company (not associated with Legoland) indicated it would be around a 1 1/2 hour trip each way but the times we went it was actually around 3 hours each way (could not do it as a day trip from Singapore). We stood in massive queues and had to take all the bags on and off bus.  All too much for young kids. Had a great time at Legoland, but would never do it again due to this aspect.",4.0

For Malaysian citizens, we‚Äôll get discount of RM65 if we have Watsons/Petron card or 25% off if we pay with any VISA card. This is as far as I know.Please bring along a raincoat/poncho because it tends to rain in the evening or you can just buy at the gift shop. There are cafes inside and also restaurants outside Legoland so you will not be starving üòã. Anyway, do come early if you want to enjoy more rides cause sometimes the queue can be long at peak hours and it gets hot since Malaysia is quite hot üåû.",5.0
240,Great!,"Legoland Malaysia really exceed expectations. It is huge so if you are travelling with young children or toddlers, you might not finished covering the whole park in 1 day. There is variety of games for the younger kids as well so you will not feel like their ticket money is wasted. There is not much food options.",5.0
241,Awesome,"Staff were brilliant especially the management. Thank you to Lim and his team for staying after hours to deal with an incident regarding my bank card. (No fault of the park, stupid me)! We had two full days here and my kids couldn‚Äôt get enough of it. The rides were really good and even my youngest could ride on most of the rides which he was pleased with. (With an adult obviously). It‚Äôs an awesome park and great value for money if you buy the two day pass. Water park was great but feel it looks a little run down and really smelt of urine everywhere around the queues. Nevertheless we still had fun and my youngest 1.07cm got to ride most things again!  Didn‚Äôt have long here as it came to thunderstorms which the staff dealt with really well and closed the park for safety. Thanks LegoLand üòé",5.0

244,Lego Imagination,"We did a trip from Singapore to Legoland Malaysia on a Thursday and bought our tickets online (Senior Tickets). Arrived at 10am and found it quick to enter. Our first stop was Miniland which showed famous landmarks built from Lego from at least 17 countries. There were descriptions of the places, but we were disappointed that they had not included the number of Lego bricks used or the time taken to built each display. There was not much in the way of shade cover to avoid the sun,other than at some restaurants. Not all were open when we visited. There are very large fans located in some areas that you could stand under to cool down as well as some places where water mist was being sprayed. You are not allowed to bring in food from outside. We had lunch at the Burger Junction and found the prices to be expensive (RMB100 for 2 burger meals). Cheaper eats are available outside the park. The announcement at the Legoland Express station needs to either be updated or not played so often (approx. 30sec). It said the train was about to depart and could not be late, but the train does not leave until all the carriages are full.",4.0
245,Improved Version of the Theme Park,"The Last time i went to the Theme Park was back in 2014 when i was not satisfied with the service, the feel and the whole experience.Fast Forward to 2018, the feeling was better and the experience was more completed with more F&B stalls but unfortunately it rained that day",3.0

248,3 practical reasons we like Legoland Malaysia versus Disneyland,"Most bad reviews of Legoland Malaysia are that they are too boring. Nothing much to do. Honestly, if you compare it with DisneyLand and Universal Studios, of course Legoland will seem lousy. However, here are 3 practical reasons for liking Legoland Malaysia. 1) Good pricesUSD85 per adult for two-day passes versus USD145 for the same at Shanghai Disneyland. This is pure comparison of prices, not comparing the ""play value"" of each park. Also comparing the overall prices of food, hotel, plane tickets (for us, this park is closer), our entire holiday expenses was around 50% of what we spent at Shanghai Disneyland last year.2) Our kids are below 5Needless to say, theme parks are always fun for kids that young. They don't really tell the differences at this age. They only care if you care to play with them. They totally enjoyed this theme park, even though there were no characters that they know. Also, this park suits our children because they were eligible for many rides, which were also much milder. We were at Disneyland few months back and they were only eligible for 10% of their rides, most of which scared them because kids that age are just easily scared! 3) Low crowd during Super peak weekendWe went during Labour Day super peak weekend. We didn't queue for anything. Our two-day visit was totally spent on enjoying, family bonding, etc. Zero time/ energy/ frustration was wasted on queuing. Zero tense moments that we have to squeeze through crowds or run to queue for the next ride, or worse, fear where our kids went among the crowd. ALSO, hotels and plane tickets were double at those more popular places because of the super peak international holiday weekend. Extremely thankful that we chose this as our holiday destination!To be honest, while it was uber cool that we visited Disneyland, I truly felt our holiday at Legoland Malaysia was much more relaxing and much better bonding opportunities (e.g. building legos, testing the robotics cars we built, multiple rides that we could take as a family unlike at Disneyland, we often had to queue separately). I won't call Legoland boring, I will call it simpler. And sometimes, simpler is indeed better.Final note: Love the rented stroller for two kids. So light and easy to push. Made our lives so much easier pushing the two kids around. See photo attached.",5.0
249,Exciting Theme Park for kids!,"We stayed at the Legoland hotel and the kids had so much fun!!  The entire trip wasn't expensive and I would suggest you buy the tickets online as it is cheaper.  If you are going with a senior, they would give a senior discount at the hotel (if you have the passport handy).  Only challenge my family had was that we booked for an early check-in but unfortunately, they had no rooms available.  They refunded me for the for the senior discount and the early check-in though.",4.0
250,Legoland side trip,We were in SG when we decided to hop over across the border to Malaysia to go to Legoland. We took a private taxi to go there directly. The place actually had 2 attractions - 1 was Legoland itself and the other was like a Sea Adventure type of thing. We enjoyed the rides and activities there. The food was good also. There were a lot of people in the food court but there was no need to wait for tables to get freed up. The best part was their Lego exhibition of different places in the world.,3.0
251,Great fun!!!,We had an enjoyable fun-filled day at the Legoland theme park! My girl was super thrilled and enjoyed herself very much till she didn't want to leave!,5.0
252,Enjoyable T-park for all family member,"Don‚Äôt forget to print your tickets (if buy online) as the barcode will be used for your entries. Suggest to buy it online as it‚Äôs cheaper than you buy it direct. The location is very huge, and we don‚Äôt face significant que in every ride (probably we were there in low season). Lots of seats provided if you go with seniors who should wait while you enjoy playing. I‚Äôm glad that I found several ride that even seniors can join. You can find lots of restaurants or food stall inside and good taste too.",4.0

256,Kid Friendly.,"If you're looking for extreme rides, this is not the theme park for you. The rides and attractions are mostly interactive and for young children. ",3.0
257,"Good for under 10s, needs an update","Not much for adults to do and the most fun we had was creating our own lego vehicles and racing them.  Mini Legoland needs a really good clean and fix-up.  2 days was more than enough for Sea World, Legoland and Waterpark.  It's all quite babyish although there were a few rollercoasters to please our novice 8 year old.  There were zero queues and we were often able to stay on a ride for several turns if we wanted.  Very expensive for what you get.  ",3.0
258,Would not advise families with kids younger than 4-5 to go,Our daughter is 3 and small built. Could not take most of the rides due to minimum height requirement of 80 and 100cm. She was 86cm. Need to have had some experience and interest in the themes available to make it really worth while. She does play LEGO but most areas were not relevant and some areas were even closed for upgrading (yes during the school holidays!) We still did enjoy some of the rides like the boat rides and admiring the mini city. The duplo playground wasn‚Äôt great though nicely sheltered. The train was fun for kids. But that‚Äôs pretty much all a 3 year old could do. ,3.0
259,Lots of Lego and clean spacious rooms,"We went there early, children could play with the lego toys while waiting before the park opens at 10am. Room was clean and large for 4 of us, the mystery treasure chest was fun for the kids. Lifts were like disco with music and lights, creating a fun and happy atmosphere. Breakfast spread was large, however food quality can be improved. Service was great and friendly by all staff. Remember to bring your lego mini-figures to exchange with the staff.",5.0
260,No more priority for Annual Pass and forced to watch opening show,"Decided to make a day trip to Legoland Malaysia. When we arrived at 930am, we found that they have removed the priority that Annual Pass holders used to have - ability to enter the park at 930am. So fine. We waited at the front gate with two small young children. Then when they let us through the gantry at 955am, the kids were so happy. However our happiness were short lived coz they stopped everyone after the gantry at the ‚Äúopening‚Äù stage. We asked a staff on duty why we cannot go in. He said that we need to watch the opening show at 10am. Another family group near us commented that they were ‚Äúforced‚Äù to watch the opening show EVERY SINGLE DAY. This is ridiculous. For day trippers, every minute is precious to the kids. By the time the opening show ended, it was a quarter past. No big deal some may say, well, try explaining to disappointed kids who travelled all the way on a long journey just to get there. Top management should do away with the silly idea of forcing guests to watch the opening show. And even if they want to, please start the show at 945am so that we can ‚Äúofficially‚Äù start in the park at 10am sharp. ",1.0
261,Visit Legoland Malaysia from Singapore ,"Dropped in with our 2 kids Highlights include - driving a lego car, LEGO build and racing cars, Star Wars displays, lots of kids rides.  We didn‚Äôt do the waterpark. Could have easily done a second day. Could have done the mindstorm programming, but ran out of time. It‚Äôs possible to stay at Legoland, but we were staying in Singapore and has a driver take us each way.  The causeway crossing (between Singapore and Malaysia) was achingly long (2:30 hr trip) but faster on the way back.  Kids still loved it.  It was hot and we got sunburned (in a tropical sort of way).  It was a pretty full day with 2.5hrs ‚Äúthere‚Äù and 1.5 hrs to get back.  Spent 6 hrs on the deck at Legoland.  ",5.0
262,Nice kids trip ,Spend two days in Legoland. Nice. Nice rides for kids of all ages. Fantastic experience is the VR rollercoaster The Great Lego Race. Waterpark adjacent to it is a nice cool down for the end of the day. Food and Restos are of course a bit pricey but convenient and easy and tasty food. ,4.0
263,Bucket List Opportunity ,"We had be wanting to visit Legoland since my now teenager was a younger child. There is plenty of amazing pieces that will blow your mind, our favourite would be the Lego Star Wars theme. There were a few exhibitions that were closed though it was still satisfying. Families with younger kids will get more value with the rides. For older teens about 4 hours is all you need. If travelling from Singapore, plan for a big day with the immigration process going and returning to Malaysia.",4.0
264,Great visit,"Booked tickets via travel agent and it's smooth upon entrance, just scan and go.Staff was responsive and good.Now we are able to bring our own drinks from outside, thank you for letting us bring our water. Attractions were good, not much change after years ago.Some toilets are clean and dry, and the rest need more staff attention.Park cleanliness is well kept.Some rides have got many staff, but few are less staff, such as Power Tower was only 1 person staff, thus the queue was soooooo lonnngggggg and ineffective.Some F&B prices were more reasonable this time compared to years ago when it was overpriced.",4.0
265,Million thanks to Legoland staffs,"9/6/19 - I brought my 2 boys to legoland theme park, around 6 plus due to theme park going to close, we all walked forward to the exit, my youngest son (7 years old) ran by himself which i did not realize, at the same time i met my friend and say hi to her...in few minutes time i lost my son...i was standing at the exit gate looking around but could not see him...i was so scared ...at that moment my phone rang...customer service personnel from legoland called me and informed me that my son was at customer service center...thank god i lost him at legoland not other places......I asked my son how the exit staff knew that he was lost... he told me he went out without parent and he started looked around...legoland staff approached him and asked him where your papa/mama...he said dont know she brought him to customer service centre.Million thanks to all legoland staffs of their profession..caring and concern ...thank you very much",5.0
266,Had a great time but please do not buy your ticket from Trip.com,"Bought 3 Legoland Malaysia tickets, 2 adult ($47.62 each) and 1 child ($41.65) from Trip.com. Didn't managed to cover the whole park so decided to upgrade to annual pass for all but turned out the child ticket sold to me is a FREE ticket so i couldnt upgrade it (thankfully i could for the adult tickets). Approached customer service only to be informed the child ticket I bought is ‚Äúcooperative activity ticket for scenic spots so it does not support the upgrade of annual ticket‚Äù ????? Pursue further but was ignored totally. In short, please be warned and check that your ticket doesnt say ‚ÄúTP FREE 1 CHILD‚Äù. My guess is the agency bought ticket as combo/package then sold it to us asssuming we wont upgrade. Other than that we really enjoyed ourselves.",5.0
267,Doing better,"Legoland did improve a lot in the passed few years. More trees and more shelters.They have keep their toilets clean. Maintain their rides. They used to have one to three technical fault on rides everytime we visit. Legoland also added new aquarium (Sea Life). Overall they are getting better. Fully covered linkway in theme park and from carpark, hotel to theme park might be a good idea. Thank Legoland for giving me and my family so much joy and fun over the years.",4.0

269,everything is awesome ... when you get there,"we stayed at a hotel that is within walking distance from Legoland. The annoying thing is that there are no markers, signs or even a hint of direction to the main entrance. so we had to guess and ask our way around. no shuttles either. the theme park itself is super children friendly, down to the staff, even the menu at the cafetaria is quite children friendly. my only grief is, that there is a smoking zone within the theme park.the rides are enjoyable and the end there is a BIG Lego shop with quite a collection of sets where on the opposite side you have a shop with a pick-a-brick selection.everything is awesome ...",4.0

271,lego(fun)land,"it took us two two hours to get there due to traffic approaching the immigration past singapore. but the long wait was rewarded with tons of fun and laughter with all the rides and amusement offered by the theme park.the excitement and suppressed giggles by my kid were priceless when he finished the nissan driving school. he could not enough of the water park and almost spent 50 percent of our whole stay. he wanted to repeat all the roller coaster rides, especially the one with a featured virtual reality attraction.we could have stayed until midnight but alas, the park could only accommodate guests not beyond 7pm. food is not allowed inside and wifi is not offered within legoland. ",4.0
272,Fantastic park,"Best value is to book a nightat the hotel and get tickets for both parks. The water could be a bot better with more adrenalin slides. Lifeguards could make the queres move a bit faster.The theme was really great. Has a bit for all ages but was disappointed that the dino section was closed. 4D cinema was quite popular. Avoid at all cost trying to win the teddy bears by buying tickets throw balls, etc these are cleverly designed to make you lose by a small margin and you end up trying over and over.",4.0
273,A Relative Average Theme Attraction with Aging Exhibits,"Went during the recent HSBC promotion which offered attractive rates for both LegoLand accommodation and theme park admission. For Lego fans, this is certainly a theme park that you do not want to miss. Really liked the Ninjago and Star Wars exhibits. The Lego Ninjago Ride was rather fun too! Loved the 4D movies  and you must be prepared to get wet! The effects were quite awesome!The park is quite clean too with lots of F&B options. However the park does not seemed to cater to older kids and they would probably not be able to sustain their excitement. In my humble opinion, best for kids between 5 - 10/11 years old. ",3.0
274,Awesome rooms!,"The rooms at legoland hotel are amazing!!!! I especially reccomend the egyptian family room with its bunk beds and treasure hunts for the adventurous kids!! There is even 2 tvs and a few packets of instant coffee-which was very helpful for me. To sum it up, legoland's rooms are aweeesoome!!",4.0
275,Reliving childhood at Legoland,We had a fun day at Legoland. Reliving childhood. Miniature Land and the virtual reality  roller coaster were favourites. It was hot but cooled off in one of the rides where we got soaked. Some displays and rides are air conditioned and so are the shops and cafes. Would probably recommend staying overnight at Legoland  if you have small children as it did take awhile to get through customs between Singapore and Malaysia there and back.Having said that we did have small children on our bus and they were so well behaved even though it was a big day. Booked the tour through Viator and everything was handled very smoothly including pickups and drop offs and everything was well explained.,4.0
276,Fun at Legoland,We had a fun day at Legoland. We went on a Tuesday and the lines were not long. The park was clean and the rides were well maintained. The only thing I think that needs improvement is that there are no water stations. The weather in MY is very hot and humid. They should put water stations around the park.,4.0
277,A normal place,"I find that the entrance ticket and food is overpriced. (if you are Malaysian,  use HSBC card to get the best discount). Overall is a small theme park,  and not very well maintained. Fortunately it was not crowded,  queueing for rides are at ease. ",3.0
278,Awesome family time,"Legoland - My 7 yo son's favourite go-to-place during holiday. Again, did not disappoint us in many ways. Happy to find out there are many eateries juat right after Sealife. KFC, Burger King, Chicken Rice, etc. Instead of dining in Legoland this round we decided to eat there.We spent 1 day at theme park and the next whole morning at Waterpark. Would it great if the waterpark area can hang few huge clock as most of us dont wear watches nor carrying any phones. This definitely will benefit all. Thank you. ",5.0
279,Every 3 year olds dream ,"My son loved it, plus side is the theme park is not too busy and the line up for rides is fairly short. I‚Äôm plenty of activities and lots of places to take photos for the kids Which kid doesn‚Äôt love LEGO üòä",4.0
280,Fun Outing For All,"Had a very good trip to Legoland Johor, our first and certainly wont be our last. The staffs overall were really friendly and patient with the kids. They pride themselves in their work especially those looking after the rides. Queue for most rides were short or almost non existent, probably due to fasting month. Plenty to shop around as there were a few Lego stores around. Food though by local standards are expensive but expected for this kind of international themed park. Parking though were really confusing as there didnt seem to be anyone looking after the carpark and with sign asking us to pay RM10.00 before leaving the carpark. No one seem to be operating the car park, so hope Legoland will address this confusing issue.Otherwise an excellent time at the park. Enjoy the wet and outdoor rides as it could rain in the afternoon.",4.0
281,Awesome magic show by Daniel!,We visited the Legoland from morning till it closed at 6pm. Plenty of fun rides with minimal crowd perhaps due to Ramadan. Staffs were helpful and the whole visit was ablast!The magic show by Daniel was equally good. He has very good interaction with the kids. And of course the children were equally fond of him. Overall a very good show and he was able to pull the crowd in especially the 8:30pm show!,5.0
282,Great day!,We visited with a couple of young children. It wasn‚Äôt too crowded and weather was good. The staffs are friendly and helpful. We also visited the Legoland Hotel and are intrigued by the performance of Daniel The Magician. He is indeed great with his skills and has a great show entertaining the kids and audiences. Do make it a point to visit Daniel!,4.0
283,Everything is Awesome!,"Families who wish to visit Legoland Theme Park and / or Water Park should definitely stay at the Legoland Hotel to complete the experience. Everything that was promised in the website was delivered on-point. The Theme Park and Water Park are both just behind the hotel. Just a very short walking distance away. Ask for the room facing the parks for a better view from your room. Aside from the Lego surprise waiting for the kids at the room, there is also a small pack of cookies intended for the parents / adults. We availed of the Rockstar Package wherein a Lego character will visit your room; especially if there are birthday celebrators, it would make a very pleasant surprise. If you plan to buy something, check out the lobby boutique first as they offer exclusive discounts, about 5-10% to hotel guests, even for the same items you'd find in the parks.There are also shows in the early evening at the lobby if your kids are not yet tired from the full day at the park.We stayed from Wednesday to Saturday and all the days we had breakfast. Every morning, a Lego character meets and greets guests by the entrance of the restaurant. If possible, i would suggest to avoid a Saturday mainly due to the traffic at breakfast. During the weekdays, we just went on smoothly. But for the Saturday morning, we had to wait about 10 to 15 minutes to be seated. Probably the only let down during our stay was that there was no bacon at breakfast. :( Yes, I know that Malaysia is a Muslim country, but maybe they could serve some for the non-Muslim guests...There are other food options for lunch or dinner either inside or outside the park and hotel. There is KFC and other affordable options of about RM 8-10 per serving.",5.0
284,Pretty Good,"We came to Legoland with our LEGO obsessed 4 year old and our near 2 year old.In short it was good, if getting a little dated in parts.There is really nothing substantial for under 4‚Äôs / under 100cm kids to do so keep that in mind. If your child is 6 and 120cm plus they can pretty much do anything.Prices are okay about average for themeparks worldwide.There isn‚Äôt a lot of shade and in a country as hot as Malaysia this is an issue.That being said the staff were friendly and our kids had a blast.I‚Äôd recommend staying at the legoland hotel next door so you can pop back in to AC comfort and come and go. I‚Äôd also recommend getting the 2 day pass which includes the waterpark.",4.0

286,Good playground for toddler,"First time visited this playground after 6 years. The entrance is rather unwelcoming, as if you are venturing into a forest reserve. Once inside, there are plenty of activities for the kids although there are min age limit and height for certain rides. There are 3 main park - the Main theme park, newly opened Sea Life and Water Theme Park. We spent the whole day in the Main Theme Park alone and about 30 mins at the Sea Life. Didn't manage to enter the Water Theme Park though. Now, the park is offering an annual pass for the price of single day pass.",4.0

290,Awesome pass blackout dates,"Made a trip to Legoland and only realized I hit on the jackpot for a blackout date on a Friday. Enquired and realized I need to upgrade to a annual 2-park pass to gain entry for the day; and the upgrade is as good as buying a whole new 2 park pass altogether which defeats the purpose of a membership pass.Had no recollection that the whole of Jun and Dec forms blackout months now. When I bought it, it was only for the 2nd half of December. Even the website was inconsistent and did not state Jun exclusions clearly. No doubt Legoland has the right to add in blackout dates as it wish; however, advertising it as access for 365 days with blackout dates doesn't sound too right- blackout months sound more applicable.",1.0

293,Probably only worth that one visit,"It's my first visit to Legoland Malaysia after it has opened for so many years.The park is divided into many themes. For those with young children, it is suggested that your trip starts from the right side of the entrance. The first stop will be LEGO city where kids can ride battery powered carts. This is probably the most enjoyable section as reviewed by my kids. Adjacent to it is the motor boating Q ride which is not bad as well. My kids have tried almost every kiddy ride possible and most are suitable for kids even at 4. The most terrifying for my 6 year old is the Dragon Apprentice which is probably abit too much for him. As it's a weekday, we didn't need to wait to enjoy any of the rides. In fact, the park looks kind of deserted if compared to other theme parks. Next is food. Be prepared to pay about RM30 and above for a meal which is kind of expensive for the variety of food. There are various themed cafes within the park but unfortunately some are not open. No outside food is allowed as they will check the bags before entry. The condition of the park is pretty run down. The Lego exhibits and decos are fading under the weather and its heartbreaking to see the park in such a condition now. Not sure if the use of lego bricks as decos are a good idea as they are probably not easy to be maintained. The mini land is especially affected. I personally find that the Lego bricks just do not look appealing and exciting when they are made larger for the purpose of exhibition than the usual we get for our own enjoyment - they just look weird. The park is stroller friendly although the shops do not allow strollers inside. If it rains, there are several areas that provide some temporary indoor entertainment for the kids eg building bricks, movies but most part of the park is outdoors. The signage are in English and so the staff are also English speaking so communication is not a problem. The Sea Life is open so that is another area for a short period of fun on top of the theme park,and both should occupy you and your family for the whole day. You may want to keep the sea park for another half day. I will say the park is probably worth a first visit, but not another.",2.0

297,Awesome place for fan of Lego,"In my opinion Legoland is the place for every kids under 12 years old. For older kids I think the rides may not be as exciting as those at Universal Studios or Disneyland..My kids are 9, 7, 4.5 and the place is perfect for all of them. Compare to the time when we visited Disneyland or Universal Studio most of the time my youngest one seems to be left out as he can only ride simple attractions (imagine your child‚Äôs face of disappointment when he found out that he is not able to go with his siblings). .At this place some of the attractions also have a mini version of the rides available for the little kids so this time my youngest ones can enjoy the roller coaster as well..There were not many people at the time we visited on Saturday, wait times is around 5-10 minutes max and we can enjoy every attraction in one day.",5.0
298,highly recommended for kids & adults.,"visit the park on weekdays and you have the park for yourselves. :Dthe only downside is the there is no more shuttle bus from Puteri Harbor to LEGOLAND! During my last visit in Nov18. There is super convenient to travel around within puteri harbor-Legoland-Johor Premium Outlet-Airport by just simply hoop on the any causeway link bus within these few hotspot. I went again this month (May19), there is no longer have this service anymore.",5.0
299,Highly recommended,"We intentionaly planned our trip here on a weekday. True enough we had the park for ourselves. The kids were able to try the driving school and boating school twice, see around the place, watch live show ninjago, we finished everything at around 3:30pm. The food price is not as expensive at universal studios. Too bad the dino land attraction was closed for maintenance. We even bought our poncho already. Still the kids had a blast here. Some rides was compmetely empty. The 4d show, the person in charge of the entrance area was asleep. We disnt where to enter so i have to wake him up..a very nice place but i think they have to add some new attractions. But still a must see place. ",4.0
300,"Wonderful, fun & exciting place for all ages & walks of life","The theme park is by far the best in Malaysia! with bright & colourful Lego-themed attraction & rides, the children and adults can truly enjoy fun under the sun. There are some rides that require you to queue but it's all worth it! After a tiresome day, you may choose to jump in the Water park or just chill in one of a few Lego studios around. Food is reasonably priced  (for a them-park) and taste really good. Be prepared to stay until its closing time as when you're having fun, time sure flies!",5.0
301,Wonderful place,"Visit the place at the beginning of May 2019, it was a Friday and not holiday season, so not too crowded, we almost never had to queue. They have lots of attractions and my kids enjoy it very much. Would love to come again some other times.",5.0
302,Frequent visitors,Theme park~~We were Frequent visitors since it‚Äôs opening. However our recent visit discovered that the cleanliness has to improve. Restrooms smelled and streets have lots of rubbish. Mosquitoes repellent are advised to reapply very frequently. My girl left here with lots souvenirs from the mighty mosquitoes.,4.0
303,super fun for my 6 year old girl,"The Dragon, VR Coaster, Flume are all fantastic for adventurous kids. Unlike Disney, you don't have to wait 3 hours to play for 3 minutes. ",5.0
304,Good theme park,Being a Lego fan was excited to visit and Park was a good solid theme park. Range of rides and themed areas. Went in an off peak time so was very quiet and while all of the games stands were up and running the majority of the food stalls had been shut and the number of character appearances was almost non existent.But generally a good way to spend a day!,4.0
305,Kids Enjoy,We have been going in multiple times and the kids still loves it. And we also love the service rendered by them. The staffs were friendly and we feel welcome every time. ,4.0
306,Legoland Malaysia Fun and Enjoyable Family Tour,"We enjoyed Legoland Malaysia, though so hot because of summer season but the kids enjoyed their experience here. We came on a weekday, so less ques and less tourist around. We rode and see different attractions with less time on line. Amazing work of arts, made of million of legos.",4.0
307,Awesome ,"an attractive hotel for families, has a variety of theme rooms besides being close to the legoland playground.  very suitable for family activities",4.0
308,Great family experience!,"This hotel experience was great, it was beyond our expectations.Unlike other themed hotels, this hotel was amazing because their focus is on quality. The service was great, welcoming and friendly! The restaurants had great variety and were actually delicious! Their culinary creations are spectacular! Most importantly, they cater to your children‚Äôs needs. Even though spaghetti was not in the menu/buffet, the chef graciously prepared spaghetti for my kids. When I lost my medicine bag in legoland, the hotel manager accompanied me and it was safety found and returned to me right away. Their customer service is outstanding.The magic show was also very entertaining for children and parents alike!It has been one of the best experiences we‚Äôve had in a themed-park hotel. The room itself was amazing, clean, cozy and had catered to all the children‚Äôs needs (we stayed in an adventure-themed room). We felt right at home. Their quality goes way beyond of what is expected.  We would definitely recommend it.",5.0
309,We had the park all to ourselves,"Went there during weekday. There were other visitors but not that pack. We went on rides repeatedly, lines were not long and we enjoyed the whole day. The food was affordable compared to other theme parks in Malaysia. Had pizza & pasta in Pizza mania. I was bummed because VR coaster was still closed. Lots of rides for kids, teens & even adults. Went crazy on the Ninjago ride. We took tons of photos at the miniland. Ended the day with some hotdogs and Ninjago show. Spent the entire day exploring the park.",5.0
310,Legoland Day trip from Kuala lumpur Everyday,Grand leisure Travel Picked me up at 6am from my hotel and started the journey which was little long. we had few breaks during the journey. i arrived at Legoland at 10.30am and started my adventure in the themepark. i had full day fun and enjoy all the ride and activities. I will surely revisit the Legoland Malaysia. We started our return journey back to kuala lumpur 6pm. Grand Leisure Travel arranged the whole package smoothly. The driver was good and gentle. we slept in the car the whole journey back to Kuala lumpur hotel and arrived at 11pm. we recommend the tour and the travel agency.,5.0
311,Something for Everyone,"We saw a few families using a Fast Pass, at this Legoland, you don't need it. The rides are really short so the queue moves fast. It was a really hot day when we visited. Its also cheaper to buy your ticket at the gate rather than online.",4.0
312,Great day in a pretty empty park!,"We enjoyed our day at Legoland very much!  The food was extremely reasonably priced, so even though our tickets didn't allow us to leave the park for lunch, eating inside was really good and very inexpensive compared to any other theme park!  Enjoyed the rides, my son did the Mindstorms class (it was so empty that he was the only one in the class!), we were able to walk on to all of the rides basically, could not have asked for anything better!",5.0
313,Funtastic!!!,"A must visit place and it's for everyoneBased on the weather conditions do the water park rides first then the theme park rides because once it rains the water park shuts down.Did all the water rides and it was thrilling and we yelled on top of our lungs.The Lego VR coaster is mind-blowing and what a steep drop!! My son went on the same ride 5 times even without the VR set.Wonderful miniature Lego sets of the TajMahal, Petronas Towers, Singapore,  Airport etc",5.0
314,"No lines, good staff.  Great for kids under 12.","Rides had little to no lines.  The star wars display was fantastic.  The dragon rollercoasters were loved by the kids.  The VR rollercoaster was great fun.  Kids loved the displays.  The electric boat and car rides were a hit.  It is very hot there.  Make sure you have fluids with you.  Also, the stores at the rear of the park do not take cash.  They use card only (a pain in the butt if your not prepared).  There are signs indicating this, but as you are normally reading the menu, not the counter, they are ineffective.The rides and staff were always good.  The Nijago show is a must.  My daughter cried because it finished.  She loved it that much. (also good to get in the A/C for half an hour).The lego displays that are indoors are amazing.  The outdoor displays are showing signs of sun damage.  For example, the airport has aircraft with wings that have sagged down due to the heat and the colours are fading.  I wish I had seen it in its original glory, It would have looked amazing.It is very much aimed at children under 16 years.  Definitely a day trip on its own.",4.0
315,One day at the Park the Other at the Water Park,"The LEGOLAND park is looking a little ""sun-bleached"" but was still a lot of fun.  It is more focused to the younger kids but there is still enough for the 10-12 year olds to satisfy (roller coasters and the like).The Water Park is a great day being both exciting and relaxing at the same time.  We hired a cabana and found it worthwhile as it was your own shaded space with a stocked fridge lounge chairs and curtains for privacy if needed.Overall two enjoyable days.",4.0
316,Lots of activities for kids,"Fun place to go with kids. Both by boys enjoyed making lego rafts in the lazy pool, racing their lego ships in the water park, making the cars to compete in the activity centre, in addition to the rides(dry + wet)",4.0
317,EASTER HOLIDAYS IN LEGOLAND RESORT MALAYSIA,"We have visited legoland Malaysia resort for Easter and were amazed by the atractions in legoland, however the best part is the hotel lobby activities after the park closes: there is many children playing around and it is easy to make new friends. The magic class and magic shows are amazing for the little ones and Daniel the Magicien is keeping all their attention, making tricks and also teaching them some.The hotel personnel is also caring and helping with various lego creations, hotel food is very tasty and rooms are spacious and clean",5.0
318,ok for young kids,"Legoland is perfect for kids aged 3-6 ONLY. The rides are boring, shows mediocre and the theme park needs a complete upgrade. That said, my 4 5 year old twin boys are asking to go back. They loved everything about it. So if you have kids who enjoy ninjago and all stuff lego, then go for it, otherwise, its not worth the cost and trouble.",3.0
319,The kids will love it,Great place to bring the kids. April was perfect as it was reasonably quiet so minimal queuing. If you get there early you can spend an hour or two in the water park and then dry off in the theme park. Enough time to cover most rides. ,4.0
320,Legoland is within half hour only from the POLO PARK!,"the children love the place so much! if you got children, then this is the recommended place to go! You can get a very good discount tickets from the Manager, Grace, at the POLO PARKAsk for Legoland discount ticket before you arrive at the PARK to avoid disappointment.",5.0
321,Great Memories!! Highlight of our trip!!!,"Don't miss out on visiting this park if you are anywhere near this area! You will find something for kids of all ages (1.5 to 99 years old, hahaha!!); but seriously we've been here multiple times since our children were less than two years old and have always had so much fun!! You won't find long lines especially on the weekdays, all the staff are super friendly and helpful, and all the rides/buildings are well-maintained and in some cases, newly renovated. We have easily spent four full days here and our kids never tire of the rides and activities. Some of our favorites are the Ninjago show, the Test & Build area, and the Mindstorms classes (>6 years old). Obviously you won't find everything that the Legoland in Carlsbad has but there is plenty (about 75% for a fraction of the price) and this water park is even better (and the aquarium is sure to be good, too). My one recommendation/caution is that the food in the park is 2-3 times more expensive that what you will find just outside the entrance not even a one minute walk away (i.e. Burger King, KFC, Subway, and a nice chicken rice restaurant). I hope the park operators make some changes in this area.",5.0
322,Fun,"A little bit rundown and few area closed for repair but it will not stop our family to have fun. A lot of lego monument look dirty and rundown(need repair). Please plan ur visiting place... The whole day not enough to cover park and water park. We have one day entry with a ticket of both world. At the end... We chose only legoland park. Starting at 10 am and we enjoy until 7pm... For local, whatever food and drink inside are expensive, please plan ur trip accordingly. Bring an umbrella to shade ur children, espcially during midday(very hot). ",4.0
323,Convenient and cosy,"Visited with 6 year old twin boys. It was just the right size without being too big and overwhelming. It had the important things covered(hundreds of Lego installations everywhere). The Lego Cities were impressively detailed and fantastic to look at. There were the usual thrill rides but also interactive experiences like 4D movies, a driving and boating school and Lego experiences for different ages. It wasn't too crowded when we visited and getting into rides or shows wasn't a problem. Highly recommend staying at the neighbouring Legoland Hotel.",4.0
324,Very intereting Theme park,"the theme park is good.. just you need to bring along umbrella because the weather is quite hot..other than that, all tip top!",5.0
325,So...so experience ,"Not very impressive as the time we went, there were few of machines down. Car park was too much hassle for a young family of mine. Overall ... so... so ",3.0
326,A flying visit,"We flew in for the day from KL arriving at 8.15am we got a grab to Lego land and waited outside. There is an area with restaurants,  benches and toilets to wait until opening. Water is available to purchase here too. The front area of Lego land was under renovation for the new aquarium that is being built. At about 9.55 they started opening the gates and did a stage performance. There is a bag check at the gate. We watched the performance which was cute and got everyone in a happy mood. We then went to the driving school. The kids didn't need to line up and walked right on. It was a cute ride. Most of the day we only lined up for a max of 5 minutes. Which was incredible and helped with the kids as we traveled with four little ones. There are some rides that your child needs to be over 100cm and 2 of ours were not. I feel being over 100cm would be the best time to visit but the ones under still got to do plenty of rides and had a great time. It was a very humid day and there is a fair bit of walking so little ones found it a bit hard. There are plenty of places to stop for food and drinks though and toilets were always clean and close by. In the afternoon it rained heavily but luckily we were in the duplo play area so stayed there for awhile. The rain and thunder cause a few attractions to close so we missed out on them. I feel like you need two days for legoland if you have little ones and then an additional day for the water park.  (We did not go there as little one not tall enough for a lot of rides). We had a great day and then flew back to KL at 9.15. ",4.0
327,Service Standards ,This place need to be maintained and keep all facility save.. If not it will not last. So sad experience ,1.0
328,Kids gonna love it,"This is our third time go to Legoland Malaysia. Because it wasn't school holiday, we do not need to queue. We can have 2-3 time for the same ride. The closing time was 6PM, but the food stand already closed at 4PM. So we need to walk to the front gate to get some water. It almost like asking we to go home.We parked our car by mistake to the Legoland resort and it cost us RM 50/ entry.",4.0
329,Not worthy for the price we paid for,Not many options bcz all rides seems to be similar. getting bored after few hours. The duration of waiting for the rides make u fel sick.,3.0
330,You could do better,"Its our first time to Legoland Themed park.It was a good experience but we were thinking, Legoland can do much better.. Some of the ride have a clacking sound and not need to be refresh.. Some place need shade because its too hot.. Overall its good place but we believe legoland can do much better.. More a thrill ride for sure.. üòä",3.0
331,Everything is awesome,"Thumbs up Legoland. What a park with something for every kid. It‚Äôs all about kids and family fun. The staff were fantastic. So helpful and smiling whilst doing their jobs. We are so impressed what the fantastic three days with spent in your parks. Thanks for the memories, we will be back!",5.0
332,Brick-tastic,"A great place to spend two days with kids. Designed for kids between 2 and 13, however there are a few attractions for older kids and adults. Even though we really enjoyed it, I do believe the place needs a revamp. ",4.0
333,Kids paradise,"Visiting the Legoland for whole day. Pretty tough to see all attractions, kids get totally crazy especially when they know and play with Lego. They will remember it for long time. Interactive places, movie, adventure attractions. A lot of fast foods and restaurants possibilities . My dream came true as well",5.0
334,Fantastic lego trip,"Love ot, children really enjoy especially the car school ride, ninja with scoring. We have bern re q to play the ninja n it was really a good try to become ninja rookies.Lego playgrounds, build your own car for racong, castle, etc. Will visit again",5.0
335,Lots of fun,"So lucky when we went it was so quiet so no queues for rides. Staff were great recommending we went to water park first as weather forecast not great. We all loved the waterpark. Legoland rides really cater for younger children. Beware the log flume ride, we got drenched we had to buy T-shirts to wear. ",5.0
336,Visit to Johor Bharu,"We gave children a vacation and visited Johor Bharu as per their choice.After landing in Singapore Changi Airport, hired a van and drove to Johor Bharu crossing the singapore border to Malasia. We checked in Somerset Medini Suits, (There is another place Somerset Harbor.) Somerset Medini is just 5 minutes walking distance. We have decided to visit Legoland for two days and accordingly bought two day ticket on line. Legoland needs at least  two day visit. Children above 5-6 years will enjoy a lot. You have a few rides. Children enjoy playing with  Lego blocks. Management encourages involvement of parents for bonding. They also take an hour class teaching mechanics to children and give certificates of attendance. There are good rides children can enjoy. Suggest going doing week days than weekends to avoid crowd. We never felt necessary of special tickets for jump the queues. Second day you can visit left over part of Legoland and visit Water theme park.  It will take more than half a day to enjoy water slides.. elders and seniors citizens also can enjoy witer rides and legoland blocks. You have food courts with limited menu. Better carry drinking water at least 2 liters. Waiter is very expensive inside. We went in early summer. They allowed us to carry water inside. If not you can always hire a locker out side. They are opening SEA aquarium in April 2019.  It might take atleast another half a day.",5.0
337,Okay,We came here with a young daughter and unfortunately she was too little for a lot of the rides and experiences so she wasn‚Äôt able to get the amount of fun we thought she would get out of it but we still had a pretty fun time walking around and sightseeing so if you gonna be in Singapore (a day trip) or Malaysia definitely a place to see. A big tip don‚Äôt take your own pram as you can‚Äôt take it into any of the shops,4.0
338,Family Hotel,No doubt this hotel can be voted as the best family hotel in Malaysia. Everything is well accommodated and tailored for a family vacation. ,5.0
339,Great for younger kids,"The location is smaller than in California, but it‚Äôs also less expensive. 85% of the attractions were for children under 12. There were plenty of food places and the rides were a lot of fun. The attractions were amazing to see. Soooo many things were made out of legos and it was really cool to see.",5.0
340,Great for younger kids....and Lego fans,The size of the park was really manageable for our family of 4 with a 6 and 8 year old. The rides are aimed towards younger ones...probably need to be at least 6 years old to get full enjoyment. There are 2-3 rides that should satisfy the thrillseekers in the family.The waterpark was great!!! Fantastic slides though we didn't get on any of them.All in all great family fun.,5.0
341,Should build walkway shelter..,"In Malaysia we hardly got Spring weather. It's either very hot or rainy day. Rainy day go LEGOLAND, No walkway shelter inside the park. Most People will decide not to go on a rainy days, especially with kids.Sunny day go LEGOLAND, Too hot to walk under the sun with kids, even we use umbrella. Outdoor playground are too hot for them to play. Trees are not big enough to have enough shelter effect. Not to mention the water park. Same issues. So when is the best time to go. Early Morning is the best time. But they open by 10am. We only get let say 2 hours to play from 10am-12pm.. then maybe can hide in the indoor aircon place. If they can build walk way shelter, and plant more big trees.. maybe kids have more chance to play there. My opinion.",3.0
342,First Time Visit ,"We stay Hotel Jen hence we took their fixed timing shuttle bus at 930am (need to pre-booked upon checked in) which take about 10min journey to Legoland.We went during a Friday (SG School Holiday) not much of a queue but still the Hero Pass still help for the boat ride, Ninjago ride. Initially NINJAGO ride was closed due to mechanical fault however we are told it might be open in an hour time and as promised we came back 1 hrs later and is operating! üòçWe purchase the Combo ticket via KLOOK which is ALLOW TO RE-ENTRY. We gotten 3 side of story... First, during entry we are told can‚Äôt re-enter, Second, while waiting for our photo we told ‚ÄúWe can‚Äù re-enter and Last, check with their senior stuff and YES We can re-enter only for Combo ticket ü§îSo the end we play safe and finished the entire Legoland.For 5 hour (we was there prior to their open count down at 10amüòÖ) we spend in Legoland, we managed to finished exploring the Legoland but not all the ride and brick house partly is because this season is soo hot and some ride my 7yo child are still not suitable therefore spending 1 full day in the near future will be more than sufficient... PS. Hero pass ride excess is via each of their exit lane therefore please get a map from their customer service and ask them for their infoof which ride is applicable for HERO PASS and I will suggest you start with those without the HERO PASS ride, E.g. Driving School (Is always got Queue, upon our entry and exit is still full of people) ",4.0
343,For Lego fans,We purchased two-day tickets to give ourselves more time to enjoy the park.  Unfortunately my grandson‚Äôs favourite 4D roller coaster was closed for maintanence on both days.  We can only stay in the park for less than two hours because it‚Äôs really HOT.,3.0
344,Have fun with limited play,"It‚Äôs fun for my kids to play in Legoland! However, the height limitation is strange for some items!

347,Mixed feeling ,"We visited over the last 2 months universal studio in Singapore Disney land Hong Kong and now LEGO landOf the 3 attraction parks this is definitely the dirtiest of all,... just where I was expecting that hygiene would be high on the agenda.The buffet was not as sophisticated as in Disney land. Plenty of food but not to the level you expect.The attractions in the theme park where not very let‚Äôs say modern and challenging. Some attractions where closed and as we are in a low season the park is empty so we could sit several times on the rides without getting out, this was a plus on the many negative sides. Waterpark Many slides are closed and the general feeling was that of dirty, the chairs at the restaurant where very dirty with several day old ketchup and gum, the slides gave a worn feeling, all made it feel that there was not an effort being done. Conclusion, with small kids ok but do not expect an up standard park! This park lack investments and upgrades. ",3.0
348,Very good,"Great facilities, well organised, rides were fun, staff were helpful and polite. Could be crowded especially during school holidays",4.0
349,a lego day !,"last week,i was surprised that my uncle tld me that he can brought me and my cousin to LEGOLAND ! this maybe sound a lil bit of funny but this theme park is totally near with my middle school...anyway its also has a water park and a hotel but sadly i didn`t visit it T_T...inside the theme park was fully decoreted with legos...they also have a live mascot from a very famous movie like WILDSTYLE from THE LEGO MOVIE....some of the rides are fun and some of it is too childidh and some of it are to scary >_<i hope y`all read my review and enjoy it ~",5.0
350,Great amusement park!!!!,"If you visit Johor with your family this is an amazing place where spend one day!!! Theme areas, roller coaster, water park and green rest area!!! I suggest Legoland to who has kids.",5.0
351,Fun to play with children,"Legoland is like a heaven for lego-lovers. Everywhere in Legoland we can see lego, including swimming with Lego. The weather is pretty hot so better bring umbrella and wear a hat. Children can try to make a robotic lego, this is fun.",5.0
352,Park is ok,The Park is ok and not worth for the price we paid. The park is not as per expectation.All rides and attractions are outdated and required renovation. 4D show sound system was not good. Food price in the park are too much high and no good test. ,3.0
353,Generally good but there's a safety concern,We paid about S$400 for 2 adult + 2 child annual passes which I think was rather reasonable when compared to the other international branded theme parks that we had been to.The rides were quite fun and both the theme park and the water park were not too crowded when we were there over the March school holidays. Annual pass members were entitled to 10% discount off retail price for Lego merchandise.What we found lacking was that most of the theme park staff did not check that the seat belts were fasten before commencing the rides. Management should look into this issue urgently and enforce safety regulations before an accident occurs.We also noted that there are no water dispensers inside the theme park and the water park.,4.0
354,One of the worst theme park ever,It's too pricy. Nothing much we can play here. Not worth it. The place not properly maintained and it is in bad condition. Car park without shade.,1.0

356,One time visit only,"Place was good and lots of activities, management needs to look after upkeep of the establishment.Theme water park is in similar lines like the one in Dubai Avoid long weekend as these tend to get very busy and you may need to be worried about  hygiene. Communication can be a challenge sometimes with the staff there Soveniers are good but you will get similar ones at half the price near Puteri Harbour shopping mallThere‚Äôs a nice Jen hotel there which has lots of facilities and rooms with good view Use sun tan before and water bases moisturiser after your time at legoland theme park",3.0
357,Basic theme park,"Basic theme park. Easy to get tickets and bus ride from Singapore from internet. Bus stop at Singapore Flyer. It took hour at go by bus to Johor Bahru, and 30-60 minutes more at customs service. Legoland was pretty empty, it was friday day at march. There was not anybody in. Some of the entertainment was closed, that was dissapointed thing. Bad food at restaurant in Legoland. There was so less customers at theme park, that i can not understand how they managed in business. Never ever visited at empty theme park. Nice and clean place. ",3.0

We only managed spent an hour inside the wet park. Would definitely come again for that! ",5.0
360,Really Fun,"A nice place to visit with families.  Try go on a weekdays to avoid the crowds, must purchase the combo tickets to fully enjoy the themes parks.   Have to spend at least 2 days to fully go through all the fun, games and show available at both theme parks (water and dry park). Legoland hotel's  rates are bit steep but you have plenty choice around the parks (condos and apartment AirBnB) .A word of advise before you plan to visit, both theme parks closes at 6pm on weekdays, open at 10am.",5.0

363,Nice place to visit,Just visited Legoland yesterday and it was a fun experience for the kids. Not crowded for a weekend and lots of space to move around although the theme park wasn‚Äôt huge. Good food choices for kids and queue for rides were mostly 5 minutes though some of the more popular ones took a tad longer. One downside is you don‚Äôt get any freebies or discount if you are not a Legoland member or an annual pass holder despite spending quite a bit on the LEGO toys. Would have joined as a member at the start to enjoy the various savings.,5.0

365,Under renovation,"I was kind of disappointed when we visted since the front signage is being renovated as well as the other rides and attractions. Honestly, I felt cheated since we were not informed about this. ",2.0
366,Honest and trustworthy staff,"My wife lost her mobile phone at the park. It must have probably dropped out of her pocket when running for shelter from the sudden thunderstorm. She only discovered it was missing right after we reached the hotel. I went back to check with the service center staff before the park opened the following day and was really relieved that one of the staff had found the phone lying on the ground at the car park. A big thank you to admissions staff member Farizzuddin (Mok) for your honesty and professionalism. As for the park, my kids aged 4 & 7 absolutely loved the rides and they had a wonderful time. Highly recommended for families with young kids.",5.0

371,Great place for the whole family,"Went there with the whole extended family (25pax) and purchased premium annual passes. Kids enjoyed their time spent in both parks but their favourite was the water park.We stayed for 2 nights at the hotel. Plenty of things to do for the kids at the ground floor. The staffs were friendly and very attentive. Special credit goes to Joanne at the reception counter for her hospitality and assistance. The only set back was the new attraction i.e. Sealife was not open yet. I guess I need to plan for another visit then... Overall, its money worth spent getaway eventhough it does cost a fortune.

372,Great place!,Pros Almost empty. No lines. VR roller coaster is awesome!Ninja ride so fun!Season pass is relatively cheap if you plan on going at least a few timesFood is reasonable and pretty good. Able to get a photo with lego batman!Activity area for playing with legos is inside so you can cool down while kids playComsDragon roller coaster - age limit? Why?  Our son was tall enough but not old enough.  6 years. Park is looking a little drab.  Legos colors are fading.  But they look like they are sprucing it up. ,5.0
373,Recommend for your kids,"This is a fun space for your children. There are not so much people. If your child is over 4 years, it will be perfect. Many of them limit from 4 years old.

It is really fantastic.",5.0
374,Big NO,"A lot of people been telling us not to go here because it will be just a waste of time. We didn't believe them and we still went. It's true, the facilities are not well kept. The Lego sculptures are fading and one roller coaster ride that needs to wear VR eye glasses stinks! We're a group of 14 pax so we just enjoyed the easy day as we're tired From universal studios the day before. It's up to you but you can definitely skip this one. Better use your money somewhere.",1.0
375,Bad,Terrible service of legoland hotel. And bad infrastructure. A waste and consumption of Lego name. Will no next time here!,1.0
376,Excellent,The waterpark is fairly tame but still heaps of fun. Designed for children under 10 years. The lines were reasonable for the best slides and other less popular slides there was no line.Legoland was great. Again the lines were reasonable with some rides having no lines with popular rides with a 45 minute wait time. There were things to see and do in between rides that you could access at any time.We spent the whole day with just under half at the water park and the remainder at Legoland. I would recommend the water park first and the crowds at Legoland at the start of the day was huge.,5.0
377,Unworthy,Totally unworthy for adult couples. Suits for family with young children. Entrance fee is totally nonsense. Rides for waterpark are limited. Sunway lagoon is way much better.,1.0

380,A memorable family trip,"We bought the premium annual tickets. These is our 5th visit to the park. It is clean. The staff are friendly. The down side are when downpour, it was quite heavy. Do not forget to bring your own umbrella or raincoat. Can't wait for the Sea Life grand opening.",5.0

What kind of Annual Pass is that?? Shameless!!! We already booked the Hotel.",1.0

384,SO SAD WE DID NOT STAY OVER,An amazing daily adventure! We were staying in Singapore and we were sorry not to spend a night in the park's hotel. Water park has something for all ages and the adventure park made our 8 year old son crazy! The VR ride was the top attraction. Fast food is served in both parks - nothing fancy but it will keep your mind of food.,5.0
385,Great fun...even for 2 Old Timers,"Definitely a haven for kids, but this was a great way for 2 50ishers to spend 5 hours. The creativity and options here was mind blowing. Plenty of rides, interactive things to do and see. The level of ""blockmanship"" here has to be seen to be believed....a visual feast!! Glad we went...take your sunscreen and plenty of cash. Perhaps find a couple of kids to take with you, as the sheer joy on faces was a treat to watch....particularly the Driving School!! ",5.0
386,Awesome for kids,"Well it is legoland, it‚Äôs great for children, but we visited legoland on working day and it is not many people around, it almost feel quite and boring, unlike universal studios or disneyland which is very much alive and vibrant but yeah as long as the kids happy",5.0
387,Didn‚Äôt have to wait long for rides,"We decided to come here on a Friday to avoid the weekend crowd and it turned out to be the right decision.  The place was relatively quiet and the kids didn‚Äôt have to wait long for the rides at all...a bit different to other theme parks that I went to!  I guess the heat was also a factor here..although it wasn‚Äôt as hot as expected the day we went.The place was much bigger than what I expected.  I thought we were only going to be there for a few hours but ended up being there the whole day and were slightly disappointed when everything closed 1 hour earlier than expected..we also should have been there as it opened :)The rides were very short but as the waits weren‚Äôt long, we didn‚Äôt mind so much.  Food inside was quite limited and relatively expensive to the outside, but it was expected.  I think we paid over 100 RM for 4 set meals.Overall, there‚Äôs a lot to improve on and yes the heat can be a little oppressive, but as the kids had a ball, it was worth it!",4.0
388,Souvenir,"Here a simple review from me, if you like lego stuff, then you will love this place.Despite if you're a teenager or adult, still a fun and recommended site to visit.",4.0
389,Great place for the kids,Kids love it. Bought the annual pass. Value for money if you visit more then once. Not much for adults except the water park which is more suitable or older kids or adults. Food was not so nice and expensive inside the park.,4.0
390,Good for kids under 10 ,"We self drove here from Singapore (that‚Äôs a story in itself) for the day as my son was wanting to do it for his birthday. The park is quite small, and doesn‚Äôt really compare to Universal Studios in Singapore, but for younger kids, under the age of 10, it‚Äôs probably a good park to bring them to. It feels quite dated, and many rides weren‚Äôt working as they were being maintained, but if your kids are into Lego, they will love being here. Food wasn‚Äôt cheap - neither were any of the souvenirs. We did the combo ticket and the water park was a lot of fun, but again, very small and fairly limited rides. We were lucky that the park wasn‚Äôt busy, so not many lines - that was probably the saving grace. ",3.0
391,Ripoff,"Whilst my kids had serious fun at Legoland, I am absolutely appalled at the exorbitant prices it gets away with. We paid nearly RM900 for 2 adults and 3 kids. My 3.5 year old was charged RM150 to walk around all day and only get to go on about 25% of the rides. If you have a short child, keep in mind they are not allowed on many things and it is not worth bringing them. They are very strict about the height rule. I don‚Äôt understand why they charge a 3.5yo who can‚Äôt ride on anything, the same as an 8yo who can ride on everything. Adults also understandably miss out on a lot of the rides and should not be charged the same as the kids. It made sense now why there was hardly anyone there today. On the positive side, my older 2 kids (5 and 7) did everything they were tall enough to do and had a ball. It was a quiet day so they went on most rides multiple times without having to line up again. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend Legoland for thrill seekers or kids over about 10, as most rides are quite tame.Food is also ridiculous. Almost all the food places were closed or ‚Äúran out‚Äù of food and yet you were not allowed to bring food into the venue or go out to get some food and come back in. The only places that were open for a meal when were trying to find some were King‚Äôs Grill (in the middle of the venue) and The Cafe (at the start) so this would be something to keep in mind. Food choices were definitely limited, we were only offered 2 options at King‚Äôs Grill, both of which were RM95. Taste wise it wasn‚Äôt too bad.A few things were undergoing maintenance, the most significant being the LEGO Ninjago ride. All staff are really friendly and try their hardest to make your day enjoyable. There is an aquarium being built just outside. Unless I was in Johor again, I wouldn‚Äôt return. If I did, I would make sure I was the only adult and make sure the youngest child I bring is at least 92cm otherwise it would not be worth it. ",3.0
392,amazing,just been in Johor bahru for couples a week ago. Legoland was good for childrens and the best place to indulge family and kids there. but the plaza nearby need add more restaurant or coffee. Staffs around there was helpful and giving good alternative place to shop. Nice place,5.0
393,Great for kids,"We spent 2 days at the Legoland Malaysia and had a great time. We thought that the themepark could be better maintained, it shows some sign of age here and there.It's nice for small kids, but rather boring for older kids/adults.Waiting time wasn't a big problem even though it was a Sunday.We went to the waterpark on the Monday and thought that was better fun for the whole family... Maybe except the wave pool, which was a joke.

We went there before few years back and in comparison, notice that the rides and mini city figurines are getting tired. Probably due under hot sun in Malaysia. There are couple of new attractions in the park which is really exciting. The new Ninjago ride is a good one! There are also stalls setup for kids to play like in fun fair. However the price is just normal stuffed dolls which I honestly think it is not relevant to Lego. Overall there are many rooms to improve for this park. Food and beverage in the park are priced slightly high.",3.0
400,This was an amazing day,"This was a most amazing day and definitely one off the bucket list. If your kids are a fan of LEGO then this theme park will blow them away. The rides are so much fun as are the different areas. Personal favourites were Miniworld where there are LEGO replicas of famous sites around Asia and the Star Wars exhibit where they recreate a famous scene from each of the first six movies. Plenty of dining options around the park with the pricing being quite reasonable. Our favourite ride was the Adventure Land boat drop where you do get very wet at the end of the ride, be warned. Overall a brilliant day and one we will repeat in the future!",5.0
401,"A little pricey, but exceeded most expectations surprisingly","My family of 5 (3 kids) went for a 3D2N stay, in one of the ""Adventure"" room in mid Dec 2018. Cost of the room and F&B were on the pricey side but we were pleasantly surprised by the quality of service and F&B within the hotel and themepark. We visited the Legoland themepark on a Fri noon and did not have to wait too long for the rides/shows. Waiting time for Waterpark (Sat) took longer than Legoland thou. The buffet lunch/dinner within the hotel was surprisingly decent, with 4-5 live stations. Wish to also give special praise to Ms Joanne from the frontdesk, for being very obliging and genuine (you can tell by her wide smiles!) with her service and attention to our kids.

403,Great fun but not a lot of Gluten-free options,"We went here as a family trip, during the week and the park was nearly empty. There were hardly any line ups and we could go on the rides as many times as we liked.  There is very little info online for what gluten-free food is available in the park.  When at the park I went to every restaurant and asked to see their allergen list.  All restaurants had a full allergen but none of them had any gluten-free options except the Market Restaurant which is located near the main entrance, so this is where we ate for lunch.  A staff member told me that they had only one gluten-free option, that was roast chicken with fries and steamed vegetables.  When I enquired further about the fries, I was first told they are cooked in a separate fryer to the breaded fish.  But I could see the fryer and although yes, they go into separate baskets, they share the same oil!  I let them know that I couldn‚Äôt have the fries as they shared the same oil and asked if I could have plain steamed rice instead.  After a bit of hesitation, they agreed that I could have the plain rice as a substitution.  They also got fresh chicken and vegetables from the back in case there was some contamination from the food in the front, I thought this was very thoughtful of them.  The meal was a bit bland, but it didn‚Äôt make me sick and I had brought a travel soy sauce package, so I put that on my rice for a bit of flavour. Even though there was a sign for no outside food, I did bring my own gluten-free snacks and I am really glad that I did or I would have been really hungry.",4.0

408,"Legoland JB, disappointment","I had decided to give my 2 daughters, age 8 and 9 years a treat during their december holidays. I book a 2D1N stay at JEN puteri hotel which was just afew minutes drive from legoland.Back to Legoland. It was a weekday entry, so it was fortunately not crowded which was a good thing because i found queuing up for the rides took even longer than the rides itself. In short, its a place for young kids but definitely not for teenagers. The rides were short, queues long (worst if on a public holiday or weekend, i can imagine) but it was fun if you dont compare it to the other famous world theme parks. The rides were not well maintained and the food outlets disappointing in choice of decent food other than snacks. My gals enjoy the rollercoaster rides, since it was thsir first experience but other than that everything else was a disappointment to them.....considering the price we had to pay for the rides, i would definitely say it not really value for money. If you compare legoland to the other theme parks around the region, i would say, boring and behind. In short, it will our last visit for sure, again, thats our opinion. If you have the time, mobility, i would suggest you go elsewhere in the region be it Spore, HK, Japan or Australia....",3.0

410,"Great value, mostly great experience","We visited Legoland Malaysia for 4 days in mid-Jan (right after Malaysian school holidays had ended). The park was DEAD quiet as in zero queues for any rides (some rides they would actually start when we arrived). We were travelling with 4 kids, ages ranging from 5 to 10. The positives: Rides seem well maintained, park was very clean and bathrooms were clean. Kids were very happy with not having to queue - we rode the Lego Ninjago ride 4 times in a row as no-one was waiting to get on. The food in the park was quite good quality for theme park food: still burgers, pizzas etc but all freshly cooked and of nice quality. Weather at that time of year is a bit variable, some days were extremely hot and humid, some days we had a storm, one day it rained all day. The theme park is not huge, but combined with the water park we found it more than enough to keep us entertained for four days. The kids would have happily stayed longer. The Dragon roller coaster was undergoing maintenance while we were there, as was one of the water slides. Everything else was operating. The fact that the theme park was relatively small made it easy to get round. In wet weather the Mindstorm building session was great (kids actually did it twice as they had so much fun the first time). Booking was easy - turn up in the day and get the next time slot. In wet weather they also enjoyed the test build centre (race Lego cars you have built and build tall duplo buildings strong enough to withstand a simulated earthquake). The other real wet weather highlight was the Ninjago puppet show - kids really loved this and it was a high quality production. Easily the sort of thing that you would pay $50 a ticket to see at a theatre in Australia. There are also plenty of rides that are undercover - you tend to do these when it is raining and the roller coasters and other outdoor rides when it is not. You have to be above 6 and 120cm to use the VR headset on the new roller coaster. If you accompany a child you also cannot use the VR. Our eldest child was therefore the only one that could use it and they thought it was brilliant.The not so good: the Malaysian weather is not kind to Lego bricks - a lot of the bricks in sculptures had not only faded, but also broken and warped (see photos). This gives the sculptures a tired feel. The kids probably won't notice or care, and it is definitely possibly to still enjoy the park, but I do think it detracts from the Lego brand. More attention should be paid by management to this. Some of the outdoor Miniland sculptures look especially tired. In addition, most of the moving feature parts of the Miniland sculptures were not working. The kids were a bit frustrated with pushing the buttons at the sculptures that are supposed to make something work and not have anything happen. It detracted from an otherwise enjoyable visit.The AGE limits for the rides are strictly enforced, even if the child meets the height limit. This is a real pain if you have a 5 year old over 110cm tall. Height limits (not to mention the age requirement) are stricter than other Legoland parks. Many rides require 110cm high. If you had a child just short of this requirement I think the park would be a frustrating experience. Be aware that even at 110cm, most rides will still need an adult to accompany the child if they are smaller than 120cm (not just roller coasters but little ""kiddy rides"" as well.)Other things to note: Lego shop is good for getting unusual items, but sets are much more expensive than Australian prices.They are currently building a Sealife Aquarium right next door (apparently scheduled to open in 2018).The water park was very good, very clean and the life guards were super friendly! They really tried hard to make their interactions with the kids fun. We enjoyed all the slides a lot - again, no waiting. Could walk onto any slide or pool we wanted. No problems with age requirements in the water park - if your child is 110cm they can do nearly every slide.",4.0

This goes to the Themepark & the Waterpark as well.I‚Äôd say Sunway Lagoon would be a better Waterpark for a win-win situation for adult & kids to enjoy their day out together.As for a Themepark, i would say Maps in Ipoh are much more organised & enjoyable compared to Legoland. Too bad when i was there the Ninjago ride was out due to technical error & that pissed a lot of people there.That‚Äôs my sincere review for this place.

Seeing the pictures shown and expecting to have a picture perfect photo was dashed.Please expect a hot or rainy weather as Malaysia is a tropical country.My 5 years old daughter enjoyed her time there as she managed to try most of the attractions but one thing I find disappointing is that nobody was at the entrance of the queue line to filter the people from entering due to the height restrictions. The children who fail to meet the requirements will only be ushered away at the entrance of the ride after queuing till the front and they had to walk away from back thru the main queue.Food was expensive but I particularly find the Nasi Bryani was delicious.Sadly all the souvenir shops does not sell fridge magnets for me to bring home for the memories there.The miniland really need a makeover as the colour has worn out due to the outdoors.The first and the last time there.,3.0
418,Some Parts Need Updating . . Not as impressive as we were led to believe,"Took less time to get here from Singapore than expected, so got there rather early.  Traveled with Limousine Transport, so had no security issues going from Singapore to Malaysia.   Had pre-purchased tickets from Legoland Malaysia direct and waited in pre-purchased lane.  When window opened we were told we could go direct to the security lines to get into the park.  Wish that was advertised better, as by the time we got to the walked to the security lines, they were huge.There were signs up that said to go to the water park first as there was a chance of rain.  Nope, we were there for Legoland, not the waterpark even though we paid for both, so it was into legoland first.Miniland was okay to see but a bit disappointing.  I'm not sure what I was expecting but I think I was expecting to see more worldly landmarks.  Also, I realise the legoblocks are in direct sunlight, but they were in need of a bit of TLC - looking very outdated / tired.All three of us wanted to go on the Lego Race (VR Coaster) so we made our way there after the miniland via the build and test where we signed up to do some coding and make the lego made objects move.  Arriving at the Lego Race, there was not much of a wait and we all absolutely loved it.  Made our tummy's churn, but it was great.We went on the Dragon's Apprentice ride as our stomachs couldn't handle The Dragon.  That was good.The Star Wars display was good with all the various locations and characters.  Also, air conditioned, so that was a good bonus.We waited in line for the Dino Island water log ride.  Just when we got to the front of the queue (riders 4, 5 and 6 - so 3 people in front of us), the ride malfunctioned and they made us all leave.  There was no option to stay and wait it out.  Pretty disappointing.The rest of the rides had big queues, so we didn't wait around.After a long day at Legoland we moved next door to the waterpark.The lazy river was great but very crowded and not enough rubber rings were available.  Some people had the rings for a number of rides around the lazy river, before giving the ring to others.The Joker Soaker was absolutely packed and we didn't enjoy being pushed around so quickly left this area.  Ended up in the wave pool as it was less crowded.  All up we had an okay day.  Remember to take your own towels and food, as the food can be quite pricey.  Would we go back - probably not.",3.0
419,Wasn‚Äôt Impressed ,"For someone who lives in Dubai and has visited Legoland Dubai, you won‚Äôt be impressed if you visit the one in Johor.. for the water park, Most water rides where un functional and nothing impressive to do. The best and most fun ride was the lazy river. Make sure you get your own towels as the park doesn‚Äôt offer any unless you want to buy from the souvenir shop at a ridiculously expensive price (for the cheap quality). As for the theme park it was fun and many options for the rides for both adults and kids, food court also had good food offerings and overall was great. ",3.0
420,11 rides in a day,"Visited during school break in December, from 10:00 in the morning to 16:00.With relatively average pace, manage to Hitch eleven rides, not include 40 mins put stop for lunch and built Lego race cars.Most time spend for queuing was for VR roller coaster, 20 mins, but was worthed.The only thing I was put a back was the fire fighting trucks. One of it need a maintenance, it is a race and the truck always lost in the end, something need to be grease.",4.0
421,Theme Park,"Theme park needs to improve on its ride. It seems that the queue time seems to be very long and the weather in this region is not conducive for queuing. Seniors who are queuing with their grand children might not stand too long. They need to install more air conditioning rooms for queuing. Years ago when I first visit, the miniature land was so beautiful but today is so run down.",2.0
422,Tips if you are going to Legoland,"The park is really average with every game needs to wait for at least 30 mins. Here's some tips if you are planning to go there:1. Call Grab to go and leave the park. It is really cheap compared to other transport.2. When you first go in, forget about the free lego. They required to build a lego which can take you easily 20mins to build one. Go straight to the lego car driving section. Kids will like it.3. All other games (plane, boat) really an average game. There was one game, firefighter, requires all family member to participate and it is less people waiting. Worth going there.4. The indoor lego centre was good as it has air-cond and you can have a rest while kids are playing their lego cars.5. Don't stay in Legoland hotel, a run down hotel does not worth the price. Stay nearby hotels and call Grab there. You will save more money but live in much better style and quality.",2.0
423,The kids will love it! Adults too.,"Our boys much preferred the water park, up and down the slides, the lazy river (or whatever it's called).  They were in the water for 6 hours, they only came out to eat and drink and then of course when it was time to leave. Take your own towel, water and snacks.  The queues and wait to get food is horrendous, can take up to 30 minutes.The theme park is a lot of fun, soooooo much to do. The queues to rides can be long and tiresome.  No food or drinks can be taken inside except water.Get the 2 day pass, 1 day for water park and 1 day for theme park.  Purchase in advance for discount.",4.0

425,Reignited their love for LEGO ,"We got annual passes to Legoland and spent a week there.   We stayed at an air bnb less than 2km away, but the kids really wanted a night at the resort.  We were lucky and only had one day where it was busy and the rest had little to no lineups.  Most days were divided between the water park and theme park.  Kids loves the build a raft lazy river and spent more time there than on the slides. We also didn‚Äôt  even hit most of the rides because the boys would do the vr roller coaster on repeat and also spent hours at the build a car and academy (sign up when you get there to secure a spot in a session). Food is pricey, as with all theme parks, but not overly so.   Hubby and I would take turns walking out and grabbing a bite at the mall next to Legoland (chicken rice shop tea time special was my go to meal).  ",4.0

429,"Tired looking, and definitely not a day trip.","I‚Äôd honestly give it a higher rating if not for a few key factors:1) they advertise themselves in Singapore and in travel documents as a day trip from Singapore. Over 5 hours transit with two young children showed that to be a lie. 2) the rides are great for young kids, the park is only a few years old and it looks tired and poorly maintained( the kids train ride has mould on it! Several of the LEGO buildings had LEGO coming off. The water around some of the smaller rides looked like it contained primordial soup.)3) one paper menu and no displayed menu, in every food place we went. At the cashier. So you had to line to see if you wanted food there. Would I go there again? Not from Singapore I wouldn‚Äôt and given how much it is to stay on site no. No I would not. Never in a million years.",1.0
430,Hot Sunny day at Legoland,Second time visit but this time a little bit different because there were some maintenance in the park. So the enterance of the park become so small. Food inside so so and park was very hot on sunny day.,3.0
431,Could do better,"We visited with children of 4, 10 and 12 years. The theme park trades on the children‚Äôs attraction to Lego bricks which is great and there were several building stations to make Christmas themed decorations which the kids enjoyed but the park was not as clean as I hoped it would be and many of the large Lego models have discoloured and aged badly considering the short time they have been there. I was disappointed at the lack of recycling bins for plastic especially as there were no refill water fountains that you find in most parks now so I dread to think of the amount of plastic waste thrown into bins there each year. We attended for the yearly fireworks on the 29th of December but were disappointed that the majority of the rides closed 2 hours before the fireworks as did large areas of the park so everyone was corralled into one area and we had to stand waiting for a long period of time and the compete for the evening was lacklustre to say the least. The fireworks themselves were great but the evening itself showed poor planning. Even down to the fact they were testing the sound system and putting rigging up the night before between 11pm and 3:30am disturbing the hotel guests! They then took it down again from 10:30pm to 1:30am the next night which as the park closed at 7pm and 8pm respectively was not acceptable. The rides were basic aimed at younger children not thrill seekers and unfortunately the one ride my kids hoped to do broke and was off all day- Dino island. We won‚Äôt rush back.",3.0
432,Great great great. ,For kids this is the best.  Our six year old can seem to get on all the rides as he makes the 120 cm mark.   The main park could take a couple of days to go through properly.  We stayed a week and kids enjoyed it everyday.  The waterpark isn‚Äôt as big as the main park but for the kids there can stay right to closing. ,5.0

Complimentary parking ticket has to get into guest service at theme park to collect only. Complimentary parking ticket redemption is not available at water park. Rides looks old. Hero pass for premium annual pass holder has to pay extra RM60 per pax. If you really into avoiding the queue for those famous rides which normally wait time is around 30mins, you can buy it.",4.0
435,Legoland Malaysia can be improved,"Lego does not seem to care about its theme park, Legoland Malaysia. It is definitely way behind Disney and Universal Studios in terms of attractions and customer experience.  We were warned and they were right.  The park lacks shades for visitors against the heat of the sun.  Unlike USS, it doesn't have many ventillators to cool you down and frontliners in each attraction. No signs to indicate waiting time. To get away from the sun, there are 8 air-conditioned attractions or get soaked in Dino Island boat ride.  The Lego Technic section has the more interesting attractions, so start your journey from there and end at the boring Lego miniland.  Try the Lego Race, Aquazone Wave Racers, The Dragon, Dragon's Apprentice for kids, Lego Studios, and Lego Ninjago the Ride.  Overall, Legoland Malaysia is an ordinary theme park that lacks magic.

438,Just ok,"If you are planing on going to Legoland,kindly try and do a two day visit because if you buy the cumbo ticket for the day,you will not have enough time to enjoy the place,mainly because there may be queues which waste time and the walking around the theme park can get one easily tired if the sun is very hot.I tried booking  the ticket online but when it got to payments section,the system would just now allow me  to pay,i hope the management o Legoland can take a look at connecting to some or all of the banks,so payment can be made directly from the account.I took my kids to Legoland on Christmas day,I bought the cumbo ticket for both the theme park and the water park,but I regretted because,there was just not enough time to really enjoy both places,the kids had a good time even though we had to queue for almost every ride at the theme park.",3.0

440,Legoland on Christmas day,"This was a good day to go. Arrived a bit after 10.30am, ample of parking at parking complex adjacent to Legoland (5min walk to Legoland entry)and because it was public holiday only cost us RM2 from 10.30am to 2.30pm (but after 2pm it was already filled up). We were lucky as there were almost no queues, especially for the main attraction rides. Maximum queueing time was 15min and the teens enjoyed being able to go on the more thrilling rides lego race with VR and the dragon ride multiple times without queuing up (no we did not pay extra, there were simply not many people). We enjoyed the 3d cinema with very few people and the Dino ride mutliple times with a maximum of 5min queuing(90% chance of getting wet on this ride, which at 35degrees Celsius outside is not a problem).Even for young teens it is still good fun,  but without the queues it is well worth it. By 2pm we finished going through the park and the more thrilling rides. However around 1pm it started to get more busy. It appears the park is in saving mode as some visual effects (moving lego structures at rides and screen smoke etc.) are disabled, however still very nicely done including lego mini city.  If you can book your tickets online you can save, check legoland website for up to 10% or more if booked in advance. You dont need to print tickets and you can access them on your phone but they do need to scan the barcodes so you need to have internet reception. Outside Legoland are many eateries at normally priced menus (inside a 500ml water bottle will cost you rm6, outside between 1-2rm). If you can do park fast enough you can enjoy a good meal outside for 4 people for the price you'd pay at Legoland for one. However, in general icecream prices inside are fairly priced.Overall even with young teens a good outing.",5.0
441,Good for kids below 10,"Revisit this place again after 4 years. Water park was good, but the park generally looks tired and needs an overhaul. Saw some new stuffs coming up, eg sea aquarium, which is good. Till it's ready, I doubt I'll visit it again.",3.0
442,Fun times and Legoland Malaysia!,"Just back from a two nights stay at the Legoland Hotel JB. I guess you say that it was a successful holiday trip if your kids already asking when are we coming back again the minute you drove away from the hotel.My family absolutely enjoyed ourselves here. We booked two Deluxe suite Pirate themed rooms that could fit all 16 of us. The suites were very clean, tastefully decorated and well equipped. Our view were overlooking the beautiful water park and part of the theme park, which is just great. The hotel lobby was very lively at all hours, since it was near Christmas, they had games for the kids and families, Santa and Santarina making their rounds with sweet treats, the holiday musics played at the background just to livened the atmosphere.There were not a lot of rides offered at the water park and you could easily finish everything in half a day. Which was what we did. We came in at about 11 am and already back at the hotel by 2pm. After freshen up, we went down to the theme park at around 3.30pm. If you can, book a two days combo tickets which means you could easily came in and out at either of the parks as many times as you want within those two days.The VR roller coster rides were down for maintenance during our visit, which is a bit of a bummer since the kids were really looking forward to that. But safety always comes FIRST and we were totally okay with that. They had fun enjoying other rides and getting their ‚Äúdriver‚Äôs license‚Äù. The food and drinks at the park were very expensive, but that was to be expected at all theme park everywhere. Think RM 10 for a bottle of ice lemon tea (that cost abt RM 2.50 outside). The nuggets or fried chicken set cost about RM 30 - RM 40. But you should already anticipate this so don‚Äôt let it ruin your kids enjoyments.Holiday trips to a theme park with kids (and soo many of them) is very tiring so it‚Äôs important not to sweat on the small stuff. Just walk around leisurely (not gonna happen as they were all sprinting lol) and if the queue is a bit too long, just smile and chat with them and wait patiently. Bring ice cold mineral water to drink as it is very sunny and hot. No one says you have to try ALL the rides at once. Come back the next day (this is why two days combo tickets are highly recommended).If you are staying at the hotel, breakfast is usually complimentary. Do try to make it before 8am. The were a bit of queue when I left the restaurant at around 9am. Luckily they were plenty of legos and play areas to distract the hungry and sleepy kids. They were soo many foods to choose from, but my absolute favourite has got to be the freshly made fluffy croissant that.just.melt.in.your.mouth.I.kid.you.not.All the hotel staff were very helpful, cheerful and attentive. Did not see anyone wearing a scowl. Special thanks to Ms Shima at the Concierge counter for helping us sorting out our combo tickets and saving us from unnecessarily spending 200 bucks to buy an extra one (long story there). We would definitely be back again and fingers crossed this time, probably the tickets would come with a free mineral water? ;)With regards,Room 118 & 121",5.0
443,It was fun!,"There were really good rides, i loved the vr roller coaster and the dragon ride. Although, i think the wait times were messed up . for example, one time it said 15 mins but it was actually no queue. another time, it was 15 mins but it was more than half an hour. also, at one ride it could hold 12 people, but only 10 people went and the person in charge didnt ask for another two people. that was probably why the queue was so long. but overall the park was fun and good for family. :)",4.0
444,Not suitable for kids under 3,"I went there with my husband and my baby girl (1.5 years old). There's not much for my girl to play since most of the games were for kids over 3.

Nice place to visit, fun for kids & adult (I guess, coz for me is YES as I like Lego since I'm kid).For me is, 1 day trip really not enough if you wish to take part all the movie, games & others and I just visited the Themes Park.It took sometimes to ""Q"" for purchase the entrance ticket, so I might suggest you can purchased it from online. For the foods/drinks inside the LEGOLAND, as we all know, it surely ""expensive"" compare to outside normal price.

449,1 day definitely not enough!! ,"We loved the theme park as there were so many activities to do, especially enjoyed the VR coaster which is a must do! However, do consider upgrading to the Hero Pass which allows you to skip lines, however, there are no separate queue lines for hero pass holders and was quite ""self-service"" to cut other people's lines haha. Do play the game stalls at numerous places as its not too difficult to win stuff. 4D movie was great with different shows showing every 30 mins. Ninjago ride was also quite fun with a lot of arm movements which I though felt like an extreme workout. Miniland was surprisingly interesting to see. Finally, Grabcars do not come here often as I had waited for 20 mins for a grab but no one picked up. I suggest going to the Mall Of Medini to take bus and taxi instead. ",5.0
450,Legoland by golden ladies,"From Kuala Lumpur, legoland is about 5-6 hours travel but the two of us golden girls (in our 50's) traveled that long to see the place. The site that welcomed us was the entrance under construction. Perhaps they're improving the place at that time. Our first stop was brunch. We left early from KL and were so hungry. Being first timers in Malaysia, we didn't quite know what to eat but the cashier was very helpful to find a meal for us with rice. The weather was unpredictable, it rained and the sun was up. So it was warm and it tired us out easily but legoland provided places to see in Air conditioned rooms like STARWARS and 4D movies. What a relief indeed. The best attraction for us was a tour of Malaysia and all over Asia in mini land and it included our country, the Philippines. Photo ops were done in all sites, we loved it. The shops were very expensive though. But we liked roaming around looking at kids in awe at the toys they wished to bring home.It was an experience to remember but we skipped the rides. We only took the train around mini land. For all ages, this is a place to visit when in Malaysia.",4.0

I find it worth the money paid. My kids had an extreme lovely time there and shy to say...I did too. Obviously, please do buy the combo ticket and if you have an extra day to spend there, I advice to buy the 2day combo ticket instead. One day for the water park and one day for the amusement park. Plenty to see, play and do here. Not only for the kids-adults too. I took too many photos here and it took me 3 FB pages to show them all..but tripadvisor only allows 10.

We mostly rode the main attractions and the VR coaster was great quality imo. The Dino Ride was closed for maintenance when we were there though so that was a bit unfortunate. We went on a Sunday but lines for the rides were short that it was possible to ride them multiple times. So that was a plus! We arrived exactly at 10 and left before 3.

The park itself is having lots of upgrading of the entrance and there are signs every apologising for the work. It will be amazing when finished.We booked our tickets and paid for them in Australia back in August. There were two rides that were not working because of maintenance so we thought that was good after what happened at DreamWorld in Australia.Ammenities were clean and lots of them. Food was cheap and good value in comparison to Universal Studios in Singapore. The staff were always smiling and very helpful. One even tried to pick up our 17 year old son (6 ft 1) blonde hair we had to laugh. Our three teenagers laughed and enjoyed themselves they weren‚Äôt saying boring. We went on a week day and so they went on rides more than once. Some rides they said were only for little children. Us big kids loved the slower rides though.They have different areas for different types of LEGO. There are huge LEGO models everywhere. My pictures don‚Äôt do them justice. There is a small model area which many iconic buildings from Malaysia all made of LEGO brilliant.All together it was a wonderful day. We left for Singapore at 5pm.

At the counter, we asked the staff is it pay RM 60 for annual heropass? Reply was yes. We ask again, so i can come anytime in a year with the heropass, yes again. We paid. After payment, the staff took out the paper bands n mark today's date on the Dec month. We ask is it we come here next month to collect the heropass paper band. Reply was u come here n buy next month. The poor command of staff's english has caused me MYR 300 to pay for 5heropass for 1 day instead of 1 year.Sad to say, several staff manning the epic stations dont care about the heropass holders.1) No staff are stationed at most of the heropass queue. Roller coaster queue staff told us we need to join the main queue, there were 15-20pax ahead of us. Heropass shorter queue only applies to downstairs, not upstairs. Whats the use of buying an express pass when we need to wait so long? 2) Ninjago ride has a polite n friendly chinese staff who gives us priority queue. But not the rest of his colleagues. Our subsequent rides were directed by a Malay guy to go over to the other side n allow entry of others who came after us. We walked to the other side, 2 other staff ignored us. They let in all the rest of the main queue who came after us n got into the next ride then come to open the gate for us to enter. Heropass holders even slower than the main queue groups! A complete waste of money for the Heropass when theres very little attention n priority given. We are all very upset with the low customer service standards in an esteemed themepark which is meant to delight all customers. Hope the management team will seriously look into this heropass matter. If the scheme is not diligently practised as ""skip the line n be the 1st in queue"", this heropass thing should be abolished.",2.0
475,Good experience,"We stayed at the Legoland Hotel 10 Dec - 11 Dec 2018. The room was great. Just that the TV remote control batteries were flat. We also had dinner at the Italian diner on the ground floor. The food was ok, but the service by Azize was good.The breakfast at the Bricks family restaurant serves decent international fare. The staff works hard to handle the load of guests between 8-9am. Azize was spotted working hard again and he remembered us from the dinner yesterday. Great job.",4.0
476,Awesome trip to Legoland,"We had a fantastic time there. We love the Lego VR Coaster, Ninjago the Ride, 4D movies at Lego studios, Dino island ride n almost everything else. However due to rain, we could not finish all the ride esp at Lego kingdom. Expensive but after experience it, I understand why it cost as such...highly recommended...Definitely will come again !",5.0
477,Great Place for Kids but some weird rules.,"Visited there with a 3 year old and a toddler, while the toddler could not do much in the Theme Park itself, the water park is still quite fun for them. Only thing that is not quite understood is RM10 for swimming diapers? Probably it should only be charged if the toddler is not wearing or never bring? As for the main theme park, it was quite fun for a 3 year old. But some rides with height limits, despite meeting it was denied because of age? And no food allowed.... so you are basically stucked with whatever they have. Otherwise the kids enjoy their time.",4.0
478,Improvement needed!,"Legoland was undergoing renovation and the walk from Medini Mall (the entrance for vehicles) to the park itself was rather far and unattractive. Upon reaching the gantry, my sister was stopped because she carried a plastic bag of banana cakes (for our family back home) because we had visited the shop in Jalan Dhoby and quickly made our way to Legoland to fully utilise the tickets. However, we were told not to carry any food inside and were rudely told to eat up all the food (6 boxes of banana cakes) before going in. How to? We asked for the person's understanding as we had no wish to consume the food at all but were once again rudely brushed aside. After experiencing that, the person pointed at the locker area. We were shocked that we had to pay RM$40 (more expensive than the banana cakes) to use one locker. Thus, we started off our family's excursion (3 of us) to Legoland horridly. The weather was scorching hot. We were walking around at Miniland and were once again pretty dismayed that a few lego landmarks were not in very good condition. The KLIA miniature building did not look very appealing, the aeroplanes had lost its colours too. Understandable that these mini monuments are outdoors but it was sad that they were not very well-preserved. The theme park does not really cater for the disabled. The paved roads are not too smooth and I observed a few people having difficulty maneuvering the wheelchairs. In terms of service, I applauded those who were taking care of the boat rides, the igloo, the fire/police trucks and the Christmas show. However, the others were not as cheerful and were quite moody. Still it was understanding as it was really hot and it must have taken a toil on them. The prizes for winning the game at the game booths in Legoland are massive in size and have no links to Lego at all. Huge banana soft toys and soft plushie balls are some of the obvious prizes. Food and beverages were costly but almost all theme parks hiked up their prices. There could be more indoor areas where the visitors can rest and eat at leisure. Selling portable mist fans or even umbrellas would be helpful too. Really hope to see improvements in Legoland, Malaysia.",2.0

482,Cool holiday with the kids,I came here with my young children (7 and 4 yrs). The kids enjoyed the park immensely. The rides were catered for their age group and the staff were very accommodating. The kids loved meeting LEGO characters. The facilities were amazing. We went in November on a weekday so there were no queues but it rained for half a day. When it rained we stayed indoors where the children played with legos. Will definitely return and we recommend all families with young children to come. ,5.0
483,Nice water themepark,"We went to Legoland Water themepark with our 9-year old child and our 1-year old toddler in Nov and as expected, the weather is unpredictable. My advice for those with very young children to consider renting a cabana or a gazebo. We rented a full-day covered cabana for RM280 and this includes bottled drinks, 2 Legoland waterpark towels, F&B discount voucher, safety box, fridge, chairs and a fan. Those with extra money to spare, u may consider renting an enclosed gazebo that is air-conditioned for RM400. If u choose half day rental instead of full day, it will be from 2pm to 6pm. There are also lockers around and the shower/changing room is nearby the lockers area in front of the waterpark entrance. Lazy pool is filled with warm water whereas the wave pool is filled with cold water. There are a number of waterslides at the childrens' waterplay area. We did not manage to try any waterslides for adults though due to time constraint. The waterpark will close all attractions in the event of lightning and thunder alert until further notice. Overall, we had an enjoyable time at Legoland Waterpark.",4.0
484,EVERYTHING IS AWESOME!,We loved the 4D cinema and the roller coaster rides. We had gotten the Hero Access but the queues were not so long so it was not really needed. ,5.0
485,A fun filled family ride,"It is a fun filled place. The Lego mini land really surprised me. They have train rides, roller coaster rides, alot of fun rides, even adults can enjoy. They 4D movie cinema was also fun, I watched 2 movies. The lines are not really long so they wait is about 20 mins max. more for kids above 5 years so that they can enjoy the rides. we ate at the Pasta Place next to the 4D movie, price is about $48RM with a drink n soup, i think its ok. we ordered 2 sets for my family of 5. Drinks & Ice cream is about $5-7RM. Not too bad but there was this outlet selling a burger set with a drink and fries for $38RM which was ridiculously priced to me. Even though it rained, there are places for us to sit and chill. Its worth a trip for kids. I won't go back bec we had seen and done almost everything. But worth a trip down, my boys had a memorable trip....so did I. Spent about 4.5 hours in total in there....not too big, not to small but the Lego structures left me stunned. Esp the mini land and Star Wars exhibit...actually all of them.",4.0
486,Not too family friendly Legoland Water Park,"We bought annual passes for the whole family (myself, my wife, 5 years old, and 3 years old). Our 3 months old infant does not need a pass.Despite paying so much for the premium annual passes for 4 persons (more than a thousand), the staff insisted we must still pay RM10 of entrance fee for my 3 month old infant, because he is ""below 3 years old"" (apparently this entrance fee comes with a swimmer diaper). As a Water Park for families, I must say such policy does not make any sense and definitely not family friendly. Yes, I can understand if a child is around 2-3 years old, the RM10 with the swimmer diaper may be necessary. But an entrance fee for a 3 month old baby (who is never going to play the water), so that the mother who paid thr annual pass can enter and watch over the other older kids????? Hey, some sensibility and reasonableness here please in the policy??? In the end, my wife decided not to enter the water park (with the 3 months old). While I went in with the 2 older kids. Nothing wrong with this, but it gave me a very strange sense of how the entrance policy is not exactly friendly or considerate to families. A kind word to the management of legoland: if you want to encourage more families to your park, do show more kindness and consideration to families. While RM10 may not be much, it certainly can put people off by the overbearing senselessness (not that we are not willing to pay - we have paid for premium annual passes for the family of 4 persons).",1.0

We unfortunately came a little bit late this year and missed the ghouls wandering around for us to take pictures with. There were less activity booths this year, but still fun for thr kids and the rides were all open and available in any case. The final performance show by all the characters and ghouls were fun and a great finisher as usual. Looking forward to next year's event. ",5.0
489,Legoland poor check in experience,We have been waiting since 11am and advised by the reception need to wait till 4pm then only can check in the King room. However even till 4pm we still cannot checkin as housekeeping not able to release the room. Had been waiting for so long but the only solution from the is to upgrade to Adventure room which is not the room we want. Poor experience in Legoland.,1.0
490,"Good day out, for kids","The park is undergoing some renovations as well as a Sea Life Aquarium being added. The main grand entrance is missing, but everything else is open amd looking good.My 4 year old loved the park and everything she could go on. Adults can go on most things but the park is aimed predominately at children (except buying things). We did not eat in the park, we left and went to the Mall of Medini which is a 3 minute walk away.The park was not busy and there was a maximum wait time of 5 minutes per ride.Thoroughly enjoyed our two days here and will likely return.Oh, it rained on and off all afternoon which is typical for Malaysia. Don't be put off, just find somewhere undercover and wait it out.",4.0

Many rides had ‚ÄòSorry closed for maintenance ‚Äò signs up - we counted 6 on our first walk around. Luckily by the afternoon some were open, and another the next day. The kids had a great time - but our stay in the hotel was more of a hit than the park!

All the food is unhealthy with a lack of range unless you like lots of fried chicken, and most of them were closed for the day. Disappointing. The only good thing was the aircon in most exhibits was below freezing which counteracted the overwhelming humidity nicely. Oh, and it‚Äôs hugely expensive. The only thing my seven year old liked was the gift shop which managed to be more expensive than Australia! So really, a waste of an overseas trip.",1.0
494,Good experience,Went with my parents and my two little siblings. There were quite a number of rides that were under construction though. The waterpark is huge but there‚Äôs not much attraction there other than the slides. I prefer the theme park rather than the water park because there are a lot of rides suitable for all ages. You probably need a whole day to explore every part of the theme park. But other than that it‚Äôs great for a family day out.,4.0

Dont know how long it has been on the rack / 5-6 slice of watermelon cost you RM7)The theme park needs more maintenance as some of the rides were closed when we were there.,3.0
497,A fun experience,"Some reviewers suggeted visitor to bring own food due to the costly price. However, I would like to share my experience, where no outside food and drinks are allowed except baby food, baby milk.... neither packed food, biscuits, bread, snacks and chips nor mineral water are allowed. Non of it will pass through the check point at the entrance.We had our meal most of the time at the Market Restaurant as I think it is most economy and worth the penny among all the restaurants in the park. Our all-time-favourite menu is the fish&lego fries. However, I must comment about this, I'm unhappy about the amount of fries and sauce that is not standardised. Some times more, some times less, I even get only 7 pcs of the lego fries for one of our purchased, i even get rejected when request to get more sauce since that time it was given too little.... Anyway, the kids just love the brick fries that shaped like lego. For the adult's menu, we have tried almost all, My husband and I think the bryani chicken rice suit our taste buds the most. I would agree that it is very sunny. We love the miniland very much but it is just too warm to hang out. We take a careful look at only a few during each visit. During the last visit during Hari Raya, they have array of thematic activities and decorated one of the legohouse in mini land according to the festival. We love it :) Looking forward to celebrate christmas again in Legoland this year.The rides are exciting, the kids enjoy most of the rides but scared of the dragon, the latest VR-ride and a few other rides... However, there are still a lot of other attractions that keep them happy for the whole day like the diving academy, boating school, the academy(we finally manage to get 2 slots during recent raya, it was always full even during blocked dates, huhuhu...). Their favourite are Pharaoh's Revenge and the Ninjago City... The live shows and 4D?5D? movies keeps us parents very happy....a place we get to sit and the theaters are air conditioned.Overall we are quite happy in Legoland but I wish Legoland could clean/replace the worn out duplo blocks in the water park, they looks not so nice and unhygienic. Thank you, Legoland.We did considered to pay to skip the line but we didn't since our first visit was during the blocked date. So we deided to go in and have a look first... out of our 10 visits, only once we were stucked in unacceptable long queue...maybe you can check whether can upgrade the service after entered the park. There is a customer service counter in the park near the entrance, just for your information.",4.0

501,Ok but aeging,"Legoland Malaysia does good job with kids up to 10~11 years old. Two things though. One - it is quite pricy for value - if you arw travelling from Singapore it costs the same (including travel time) as Universal Studios. Two - some attractions require repair/maintenance - e.g. Dino Island in the past it was live exhibit with sound and lights now nothing works anymore and it is ride through static display, Dragon roller-coaster - in the past there was 2 set of them now it is one makingn wait time much longer. So again - not bad but requires upgrade and right set of expectations. Lastly if you are coming from Singapore take NTUC card and it will give you 25% discount on tickets.",4.0

Right from the entrance, there was a Castle for the children to run in and out, a favourite for playing catching while I managed the check-in process. Lego pieces can be found everywhere which was great. The lifts were fabulous with lights and music. The kiddos were happily dancing every time they entered the lifts. However, I felt that improvement can be done to the bathroom. The door for the shower area were heavy. The lack of corner shelf was inconvenient for us to place our own shampoo and body wash. There wasn‚Äôt any laundry line for us to hang wet swimwear as well. The view from our room at level seven was very beautiful though. Picture attached.Please note the rating is for the overall hotel room stay and theme park only. The food at Bricks Restaurant was shocking. There was crushed ice in the salmon sashimi. Bits of broken shell in the oysters. Very disappointing when it comes to the food in the hotel. ",4.0

It seems that none of the bricks had been replaced since the park was opened. lol. :) Limited choice of food(being a weekday so a bit understandable) and a bit expensive too.I'll update my review to 5 star if they replace the faded bricks in the Miniland :)Some parts of the park are being added so look out for those.",4.0
506,"Dirty water, expensive food, no safety, So Overrated","Brace yourself, it will be a long story. It was our first trip to Legoland Malaysia, Johor Bahru. We went in 3rd November 2018. Our huge family purchased Combo tickets for one day. We were extremely energized and looking forward despite the fact that the rides are implied more for the younger children. It was basically for my 2 kids age 5 & 2 to enjoy.The waterpark was pleasant and interesting. Anyway the toilet truly require an overhaul or upgrade. To be honest, it was filthy, and exceptionally diminish for amid light The waterpool is additionally VERY DIRTY. When we returned to the hotel to take a wash, some of my siblings encounter irritation, sudden developing pimples, and my son back was VERY red that it ends up skin inflammation spreading following a couple of days (He has a minor eczema before this) We understood that it was the water at the waterpark that we've been dunked in for hours. Thus, their Legoland Waterpark needs multi day out of each week to do cleaning for the pool! At around 1.45pm. We are done with the wet park and continue for the amusement park, we were eager for lunch. We went for the closest eatery in the amusement park, the nourishments and beverages are on the whole costly. We had no option to purchase there as we were told outside food isn't permitted. But for a cup of espresso cost 11 ringgit? Thats crazy! So for the rides, my 5 year old child  went for the 'Wave racer' and her stature exceeded their necessity tallness. Anyway when she came to at the first line, the staff there said ""she isn't permitted for the ride as she is 5 years of age and that she should be 6'. What is the huge difference?? They have to stick to one guideline, for example, tallness prerequisite such as in Universal Studio Singapore. Wound up, for alternate rides, we need to misled the staffs about her age as we would prefer not to make her feel upset or her ticket to be a waste. As for my younger son age 2, he just got the chance to take 2 rides. The rest we didn't have time to play on due to mishap on one of the ride occurred... At around 5.15pm, We took a ride at the 'Dino Island'. We were looking forward most for that ride as we know we're going to get wet before heading back. So we as a whole 6 adults took the ride + 2 other individuals(a dad and his child, I assume they are locals there). In the vessel, we reach to the peak, and got the opportunity to glimpse outside from the cave before dropping us down to the ground brimming with water. In a sudden, our vessel stalled and stop at the edge of the steep slope. The engine motor was loud,trying its best to push our vessel down however fizzled. At that point, the staff requested that we hold up as they endeavoring to figure out of how to let our vessel goes down. After 10 minutes, we are still stuck there nervously. We waved to the CCTV nearby to let us off as we didn't want to continue the ride. The staff instructed us to pause while they ask someone to open the fire exit door at the back of the building. In this sort of circumstance, the fire exit was locked?! For what reason would a fire exit be locked? So one of the staff with a safety harness arrived, we have to wait for the seat restraints to be pulled up. Finally, when we were free, all of us were traumatized by the incident. My sister who has the most fears over the incident, she ran towards her 3 month old baby and embraced him genuine tight as she was perplexed anything bad would have happen to her. My parents were extremely stressed. They even saw the entire thing from beneath and said that the vessel was somewhat inclined to one side when we were trapped. We told the staffs our emotions and my parents shared their view. We inquired as to whether there is any complimentary, and they offered us express ticket to be utilized by that day itself. It was 5.45pm around then, and people are already heading out of the amusement park, mostly their rides line are not long. So whats the point of utilising the E-tickets at that hour. We contended as E ticket for that day is a silly complimentary to give. The safety officer of the park even conversed with us and guard his position. He even said ""This isn't the first run through as they were additionally same mishaps occurred previously.'' I was even more shocked! So even after various mishaps occurred, despite everything you have the bravery to do nothing? Simply let it occurred? Around then, we were likewise stressed for other guest to take that ride in the future as our incident was viewed as minor. By then, that's where they will do something about it? We are talking about people's lives! We even conversed with the Legoland Manager by the name of ""Rozaimi"" despite everything he still influencing us to utilize the E ticket. I gave up! That will be last to Legoland and we will NEVER come back again!  Taking everything into account, none of them apologies.We were on top tangling for our lives and they rather continued offering us free express tickets?! Legoland, if u need to influence me to report by email. Do you by any chance read those? Regardless of whether you read, do you make a move?Legoland Malaysia is truly kicking the bucket, their carpark is additionally not exceptionally inviting. No solid, no design, not welcoming!

It was a souvenir toy that my son likes so much, that he even cried himself to sleep and I promised him I will get his toy back.The next day, 9:45am, the crews are preparing in the entrance, I approached one lady and told her that I lost something yesterday. She then told me to go to the ticketing counter and tell them if they found it. So I went there... only to be told to go back to the entrance and file a lost report. So I went back to the lady and told her I needed to file a report and she said, ""No, go back to the ticketing counter and file the report there"". I told her I was going circles and was just told to file there in the entrance. ""Who told you that?!"", she said. ""Lady from the counter 3"". So she went inside  I waited for around 5mins, she came back and told me, ""Im sorry I looked at the lost and found room and couldnt find your toy"". I told her to please check again or check the place where I know I lost it, The Brick Shop... I told her if they cannot find it, please can I just buy it from one of their shops just so that my son will stop crying. And her answer was, no. She wont let me in unless I have an adult ticket or... the shopper pass. A shopper pass allows you 45mins to roam in the theme park but you have to deposit MYR 188 AND buy MYR 100 worth of LEGO products... Desperate as I am to find / buy that toy, I availed the shopper pass.The first store I went into was The Brick shop - hoping and praying I would find my son's toy. And you know what??? My son's toy was there. It was not given to the lost and found department yet. I was really happy I found the toy still there! Now I was thinking should I still buy MYR 100 lego products when they did not even check eagerly???Cramming with time to catch up with our flight, I did not argue with them anymore, I just bought MYR 100 worth of LEGO products and got my deposit back.I was expecting a little bit of compassion from that lady Manager. I even cried in front of her. I bet she doesnt have a child yet so she doesnt understand. ",3.0

526,Dreamland built with LEGO ,"Legoland hotel and theme parkLEGOLAND is certainly one of the popular places of interest for tourists who have children between the age group of 2 and 12.

530,Not a great experience,"Went on Saturday to visit Legoland Malaysia. We have been also in Denmark Legoland and as a setup and selection of different areas and sights the Malaysia one was promising. However I doubt we would go again.A few points- many items were closed- a lot of the equipment was broken, out of service- the entrance area was under construction as the new sealife building was being built- kiosks were closed, most of them- toilets dirtySo, the whole place left a feeling like it has seen its best days and worn out, not maintained anymore.We visited only the amusement park not the waterworld. We made the mistake to go on Saturday, so maybe  the experience was dampened also partly by the several hours‚Äô travel time from Singapore. Not experienced in travelling to JB..",2.0
531,Highly Recommended!,"Highly recommended especially for Family Trip! The waterpark is fun cause can see lego is everywhere and play with the lego. The safe jacket and waterproof pampers is provided for the kids. For the Theme park is fun especially the roller coaster and the rest of the games suitable for the children. Besides, there is a lot of lego building monument. Maybe can do corporate games here too! I went there Twice with my family! So, have fun.",4.0
532,Excellent for families with young children,"        During our visit to Malaysia we brought our three young children ( ages 8, 5, and 2) to Legoland.  We bought a 2-Day park hopper pass which allows you to access either park multiple times for 2 consecutive days.  It was our first visit ever to a Legoland park and our children had an absolute blast, and park hopper was the perfect option for us!      The 1st day we spent at the theme park.  I‚Äôm sure it factored in that we traveled during low season, but there were no queues at all for any rides or activities.  Still the whole day at the theme park became necessary as our children leisurely spent time at the different activity stations and the various playground areas throughout the park.  We were a bit disappointed that our 2 and even 5 year olds were unable to get onto some of the rides because they didn‚Äôt meet the height requirement, despite the rides being rather mellow.  But every ride also had a lego table right near the line to keep the littles busy while the older children and parents waited, so that was appreciated.      The intricacies of the LEGO theme,  displays, and statues throughout the park are just unbelievable, and not only our young children, but we as well were in awe at every corner of the detail of everything!      We spent most of the next day at the water park before saving the last 2 hours of opening time back at the theme park to enjoy activity stations.  The water park is just wonderful and an especially great way to cool off in Malaysia‚Äôs July heat.  Our 2 and 5 year old again were unable to get onto most of the slides, but we were all more than happy with spending our time between the river and the splash park.  The LEGO river is so much fun, especially with the giant LEGO bricks floating around. The build-a-raft was highly anticipated, but not quite as easy as we thought it would be.  Most of the inner tubes don‚Äôt have the attachments needed for the LEGO bricks, and the ones that do don‚Äôt quite fit on properly.  Nonetheless, the floating and splashing around among LEGO bricks was still so much fun for us all!  The kiddie pools and activity water tables and chutes were awesome and kept our children entertained plenty throughout our stay.  ***just a heads up on attire, along with being a kids oriented water park, it‚Äôs location in the IndoChina region also means that a majority of locals are Muslim, and therefore most women/girls present in the park are fully clothed and wearing hijabs in the water and on the slides (despite safety signs saying otherwise).  I anticipated this, so I wore a one-piece bathing suit and felt perfectly comfortable.   I did not see any women in bikinis.  ",5.0

534,Getting Worst,"I have been to Legoland Malaysia for countless times and this experience is the WORST ever!1) the iconic huge signage saying ""Legoland Malaysia"" was removed and replaced small back draft! very dissappointing!2) we went on a sunday but only 60 percent of the attractions were opened! most of them are closed/ or under maintenance.3) they do not allow you to go out of the park and return the same day. the food inside the park is too expensive and very limited so we usually go out and eat. 4) the theme park looks like a ghost town. you can only see a handful of people considering we went on a weekend. as I remember, I seen more theme park employee than guest.5) we usually stroll from 10 pm until 6 pm, but our last visit, it only took us from 10 pm until 2 pm. almost no guest and most of the rides are closed.

So all and all, we stay at a nearby apartment for 3D2N. We went to the theme park on day 1, the weather on day was sunny. So thats the perfect weather for it! Some of the rides were not so suitable for kids below 6yrs old. So we clear most of them by around 6pm. On day 2, we went waterpark. It is about 1/4 of Legoland Theme park size. Hence, you are just repeating the same whole activity over n over again. But it was an enjoyable one. Only thing is they should have adopt cashless payment like Sunway Lagoon. I would say, the duration was pretty good! And we enjoy them too!",4.0
536,Bus from Singapore to Legoland ,If your after a day trip to Legoland from Singapore then the bus is the way to go . We booked on line with WTS travel for departure from the Singapore flyer at 9am. It was such a fast commute you do get off the bus twice once for immigration hence you need your passports and the other for customs . We were in Legoland by 10.20am. We took the 5.15pm bus home it does take longer coming back but the busses have priority lanes so still much better then driving . The buses were very nice reclining seats well air conditioned . Best way to do this Park let someone else drive you there . ,3.0

(And my daughters favourite) The larger dragon roller coasters pretty good, but fairly traditional, no looks or big frights, and the dinosaur water ride is under developed (just goes up and down again... pretty boring really.... but you do get VERY VERY wet, (good if you want to cool off)There is plenty to eat and drink... the food is ‚Äòtheme park quality‚Äô but it‚Äôs not bad. The LEGO shopping is good, and if you have good internet, you‚Äôll be able to check prices... I found that most sets were about 20% cheaper than in toy stores over the border. Our kids loved it... so that‚Äôs what really matters...there are A LOT of out door playgrounds... and if you want to look at LEGO... there‚Äôs a lot of that too :)We popped in yesterday in the late afternoon, and it was a little more enjoyable, out of the mid day sun...",4.0

Legoland itself is definitely aimed at kids 5-10.  There were no queues.  The water park was great fun too.  If you go, do all 3 as they add up to a great experience.

542,Make our little boy feels special on his birthday ,"We have recently visited the Legoland Discovery Centre in Osaka and our kid just couldn‚Äôt have enough. He kept asking for Legoland. Since we were in Singapore, we made our way to Legoland by hiring a private transfer. The trip to and from Sentosa was about 90 minutes each way. At the counter, we asked whether there is something that we could join or do for our kid‚Äôs birthday. Instead, they made a special something for him by giving him a big birthday badge to put on, a small birthday figurine and also entrance fee waived. Everywhere we go, everyone would be saying happy birthday to him. That big smile! Also, all the staff was so nice. Also, we went on a weekday and there was barely anyone. So, he went on rides after rides non-stop. There are a lot of age appropriate rides for younger kids in addition to bigger kids rides and they enjoy them so much. Also, with all the figures walking around, Lego fans will be thrilled. I did not even know our kid can name so many of many figures! There are car rides, boat rides, train rides, plane rides, horse rides, other more exciting rides. It was close to Halloween so they had special Halloween themes around.However, the positioning is quite different from the Discovery Centre the Lego building area is not as exciting as the one in Osaka. We do like it in Legoland Malaysia and will be back to visit again. Thank you for making the day so special for our kid and to all the wonderful staff! ",5.0

There seemed to be a lot of the restaurants and food sites closed, along with a few of the key attractions. On top of this some of the shopping sites were under stocked, and one of my favourite features, being able to get your photo printed onto a lego brick wall, was not available apparently for a month. I understand that during non-peak periods rides and food areas must be closed and maintained, but there was no warning of this on the website when we booked, and no discounts offered to align with such closures. So this tarnished my trip a little. We still had fun on the rides that weren‚Äôt closed, and the staff were generally pleasant and helpful. It was nice to be at the park when it wasn‚Äôt very busy, but also this seemed to detract from the overall atmosphere of the park. Will definitely take these issues into consideration when deciding if we will visit again. ",3.0
557,"Legoland great, but a mission to get there","Legoland Malaysia is a great day out for kids and adults. There‚Äôs lots of rides, cinemas and great themed lands.Our 4yo was in heaven from the minute we arrived-he loved driving his own Lego boat, car, plane and fire truck. There weren‚Äôt a lot of bigger rides he could go on, but the roller coasters he could go on he liked. The Lego shop was also well stocked and the entry tickets and food at the park very reasonably priced.We were at the park on a public holiday and it didn‚Äôt seem that crowded but the queues for some of the rides were quite long. We realised some of the rollercoasters weren‚Äôt being filled up, as if they were trying to generate a longer queue to make it look busy. When the queue got to the end of the railings, they started filling up the rollercoaster. This was frustrating as we would have liked to have gone on that ride a few times.Our son had a great day, but unfortunately this theme park is a mission to visit on a day trip from Singapore due to the border crossing situation. We left before 4pm and it took us about 3hrs to get back to our Singapore hotel.

Hotel totally in theme with Lego at every turn, peppy Lego movie music in all the public areas, and the staff all keen to make your stay enjoyable (Azize in the restaurant especially cheerful).  Being right beside the park is a total gift as you can come and go as you please. The heat can be a bit exhausting for non tropical people, so having your hotel (&pool) right next door is perfect.  Get the waterpark included in your ticket, well worth it.Most things reasonably priced, but you‚Äôll pay big dollars for wine of any sort.

It was fantastic!  There was pretty much no one around and no queues for the rides. We were able to go on a ride and do multiple times without lining up. There is so much to see and the humidity and heat meant taking it slow with young kids so definitely recommend doing a two day pass rather than race around and do it all in one day. ",4.0

563,Not an international destination,"Very disappointed in the Park. As this theme park is part of an international chain, I expected it to be maintained to high standards. It‚Äôs very worn and dated. All of the LEGO statues through the park and the village are very faded. Everything around the park is just looking tired and in need of a refresh.The park opens at 10 am but they are still doing tests on the rides for the first 30 minutes that the park is open. One of the main rides was closed in the theme park, we werent told this on entering. It only took us half a day to do the main park. There weren‚Äôt that many rides or attractions. We went during the Australian school holidays and the park was very quiet, we didn‚Äôt have to queue for anything which is good. Don‚Äôt buy a pass to skip the queues as it‚Äôs a waste of money. On the second day we went to the water park thinking it would be better. Again the main attraction slide was closed, we weren‚Äôt told this on entering. It was going well, we had done the lazy river, and about 5 slides. We went to look for other slides and realised that it. Literally that was the full park. We were done by lunchtime. Overall this would be a good theme and waterpark for the locals. But for international travelers expecting something awesome, a destination park as such it‚Äôs terrible. My local water park in Perth is actually better than this. For an international brand of ‚Äúresorts‚Äù I don‚Äôt feel this meets international destination standard. I wouldn‚Äôt go back, and I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it to friends or family.",2.0
564,Super fun but Looking sun bleached ,"We had 2 days of great fun but we have visited Legoland in Windsor (UK) and so Malaysia comes a poor second to the UK experience... One of the frustrating things is the number of rides that were not working and not listed as under maintenance on their website.Tip. Get a multi park ticket for the waterpark and Legoland... go to the waterpark, pop your stuff in a locker for the day. Go to Legoland with less baggage and then after a few hours go to the waterpark to cool off and recharge! Works really well to then go back to Legoland again after a few hours at the waterpark!

569,Revisit after 4 years!,"Spent 2 days in Legoland, separate waterpark and dry park each day which I found more cost effective than getting the combo tickets. Now that my kids are older (6 and 9 years old), they enjoyed more with less height restriction, especially my older kid who can play most of the rides. I'm impressed that the waterpark is very clean and well maintained. Life-vests, tubes and floats used were adequate and also in very good condition. Toilets are abundant and clean, however, maybe due to high usage, the shampoo/ body wash in dispenser in the shower cubicle I was using had finished.The next day, we arrived early at dry park, knowing well it is public holiday. We had our tickets ready, hence only queue to go to the theme park. There was a welcome dance from the crew during opening at 10am.Although it was a Public Holiday, the queues were bearable. The longest wait was for VR roller coster, about 1-2 hr. Others were less than 10 minutes on average. We particularly enjoyed the Ninja-go ride. We also enjoyed the Mindstorm workshop immensely, having incorporating robotics into Lego. Please ensure that you book ahead. Foodwise: more of fried food and some local dishes e.g. chicken rice and briyani rice. I would prefer if there are healthier options. Staffs were friendly and courteous and cared to check on the height of the users for  safety. There were also lots of lifeguards ensuring safety to all visitors young and old, which is a plus point in comparison to some other theme parks that I've visited.",5.0

Prices for food and drinks are usual theme park expensive but won‚Äôt break the bank.Check the attraction schedule before coming as there were a few shut for maintenance.

Every Lego figure and Lego buildings are amazing!  It‚Äôs stunning too see how very much alike the designs are to the real ones.  The details that were put so much on every design are awesome. This is not only a place for the kids but for Lego enthusiasts as well!  They‚Äôre be keeling over in excitement lol! Every store sells all kinds of Lego merchandise and they‚Äôre expensive. ",5.0

575,Unpleasant Experience with the Security,"Dear Legoland Team,LOCKED BACK IN THE PARK AT 8PM!First of all, before you jump into any conclusion, we did leave the park before the closing hours at 6PM. On Sunday, 9th September 2018, I visited the park with my 5 year old son, just a mother and a son trip. My car was parked near the parking zone 1 and 2 and we had to make a long (medium) walk to the park entrance, passing through the construction area (said to be for the new sea life, which is awesome!) and we emerged from the side of ticketing counter. We did have fun at the park although it was raining intermittently but that didn't stop us from having fun. However our horrible experience started after we left the waterpark at 6PM. We went to have dinner at the next door mall, the Medini Mall. After the dinner at around 8:30PM, we had to walk back to the parking and pass by the construction area and was surprised that they had closed the door (which was near the ticketing counter) leading to the parking. At this time, the place was already a bit dark, not much lights were turned on and my 5 year was getting scared. I approached the staff at the ticketing counter (luckily there were few people who were still working at that time) and requested them to open the door leading to the parking which was situated at the side of the counter. This guy helped to contact the security guard for what turned to 10-15 minutes waiting time for him to come and open the door. I saw the guard just standing there, playing with his phone and did nothing to lead me to the parking area. So I just proceeded to walk to my car along a dark alley (I had to use the light from my phones so we didnt trip, mind you again I have a 5 year old with me) but then I ended up back into the park, near the Lego train maintenance area. I quickly realized that this was not the pathway I took on my way there that morning. I approached the guy who was conveniently there and he helped by contacting the guard to help me find my way out. I was really surprised that the security there just took the guest's safety and security lightly. For them to see a woman having to walk along the dark and secluded place and not doing anything to help her is just so disappointing.I just hope that your team will look into this matter, perhaps to install more street lights along the pathway leading to parking zone 1 and 2. Although it is understandable that the area is under construction, the safety of your guests should be your main priority. Thank you.Regards,Ms. Nur Izdihar Amir Hamzah",1.0
576,.,"Went to legoland to celebrate our first borns birthday because she's into lego. Overall it was okay, no wow factor for me but atleast my kids enjoyed it specially my first born thank you to the staffs you made my daughters birthday extra special.And by the way before you head to the main ticketing booth of Legoland alot of by standers offer cheaper tickets i dont know why or how did they get it but its a bit irritating.",4.0
577,Was just o.k,We were so looking forward to visiting legoland as we had read that 100cm tall was the minimum height for some of the rides and it meant our 4 year old could go on most of the rides unlike some other parks we had already been to.... how wrong were we!? Sure it‚Äôs 100cm minimum but they also have a age as well which is 6 years old! Just a heads up to other parents who don‚Äôt realize this until you‚Äôve got your child in tears because they arnt 6 years old and can‚Äôt go on very basic rides yet went on rollercoasters at a different park the day before!,3.0
578,A good alternative to Hong Kong Disneyland for Filipino families with young children,"The VIP expedition in Legoland Malaysia has a more personal & exclusive approach with one designated tour guide per family group. The one assigned to us, Miss Camilla, watched over our kids, took family photos of us all the time, & even gave some tips on how to maximize our stay on both theme park & water park. It surely was a memorable experience, especially for the kids.",5.0
579,A fun term break holiday with young kids,"My family and I (2 adults and 2 children aged 8 and 4) took the ‚ÄúAll-in-One Package‚Äù directly off the Legoland website. This comes with 3D2N stay and 2 Day pass to the parks and 2 way limo transfer from Legoland to Changi Airport and this proved to very convenient esp with kids. The Driver, Mr. Shah, was very friendly and assisted us with the immigration at both SG and JB checkpoints. Upon reaching the hotel, check in was a breeze. Even though we reached earlier by a bit, our room was ready. The RoomWe took the Premier Pirates room which comes with a queen size bed in the main room section and a bunk bed in the kids section. These 2 sections are adjacent. The room was very well decorated and the kids loved the theme. They got right down to solving the puzzle and unlocking the treasure chest. There is also a box of Lego for them to play. The toiletries are well stocked and have everything you need and the bathroom is spacious enough with a shower area and vanity area.The Parks2 days are necessary to explore the 2 parks. We splashed around in the Water Park on the 1st day and there‚Äôs plenty of water play areas for kids of all ages. The Joker Soaker wet playground seems to be the most popular. There were also many lifeguards on duty at various sections ensuring safety. 2nd day, we ventured into the theme park which takes a whole day by itself. We started late due to the rain and the great thing abt this park is that there are a number of indoor attractions which you can head to if it rains (Build and Test, Ninjago, Star Wars, sheltered playground, Mindstorms, Technic Twister). Plenty of things to keep the kids entertained and enthralled.Bricks RestaurantOur package comes with a 1 night buffet dinner and the spread was plenty. The local, western, Indian sections and the desert options were plenty and we thoroughly enjoyed our dinner. The Breakfast Buffet is offered at the same place and there was a lot of variety for adults and kids to choose from. All the meals served at legoland are Halal and so this is great for Muslim guests. There is also a Medini Mall just outside Legoland (5 min walk) and it has some fast food outlets such as Subway, Burger King and a good Thai Restaurant. We had BK for the 2nd night dinner.The Hotel LobbyThe Hotel Lobby is a favourite gathering place for the kids and every night there is usually a magic show around 2000hr. There are also 2 pits filled with lego bricks for kids to play with and we usually had trouble getting the kids back to the room as they were so pre-occupied in building.In summary, we enjoyed our stay thoroughly and all aspects of our stay were fulfilling.Special thanks to Legoland staff whose service we grealty appreciate: Shah (Transport), Aziq (Check In), Bricks Restaurant Crew and Joanne (Check Out).",4.0
580,Still a fun place for kids under 12 but unfortunately some wear and tear are visible.,"5 year since my last visit. This visit allows my youngest kid to really fully enjoy many rides she don't get to do 5 years ago. It is not easy to maintain such a large park and unfortunately there is a couple of rides is not fully functional like the VR Roller Coaster ride which supposedly is one of the highlights, nevertheless, the ride still an enjoyable one.

582,Minimal wait time during Sep school holidays,"It's a blessing that our first visit to Legoland is not plagued by long waiting times for rides that is usually seen in other theme parks. On the contrary, we hardly needed to wait for anything. The longest wait we had was probably about 15 minutes. This means that we can spend more time playing and enjoying the rides. Oftentimes, we get to repeat the rides even without having to get off the rides and rejoining the queue because there was no one else in the queue. Theme Park:Our kids' favourites are the Ninjago 4D ride. I've lost count of the number of times we repeated this. I even have aching shoulders (from the action of 'throwing shurikens' during the ride) as proof of this. Other than that, the kids also liked all the roller coasters. There are 3 of them, which we call Big Dragon, Small Dragon, and VR Race. The Small Dragon is just a smaller and shorter version of the Big Dragon, probably meant for those who are not used to roller coasters. The Big Dragon is exciting but not overly scary. My youngest at 7 has no problem handling it. In fact, she seems to be the one who enjoys it the most. The VR Race should be enjoyed with the VR headset, but during our visit, the VR headsets were not available. Nevertheless, visitors were allowed on the ride still, just without the headset. The place itself is quite huge and takes some time to walk around. Under hot and humid weather this can be quite exhausting. It's just something that visitors have to note and bear in mind. Not much they can do about the weather. They have scheduled workshops for kids to learn about MindStorms and how to control it via programming. Quite popular and slots quickly filled up. Another popular place is ""Build & Test"", where children get to build their own vehicles using Lego bricks and race them on tracks. My kids enjoyed this. They also have a section for children to build buildings to see how they fare in simulated earthquake condition. Water Park:We also enjoyed the water park. The water slides are quite fun. The kids enjoyed the lazy river most though.",4.0
583,Legoland waterpark,"After visiting the main legoland themepark for umpteen times, we finally decided to try out the waterpark. It is not the best waterpark we have ever visited but our family had a great time nonetheless. Like Legoland, I think the water park is especially suitable for kids between 4-12. The rides are fun and not too extreme. We were there on a Thursday of a school holiday and there were hardly any queues. towels and lockers can be rented for a fee. E.g Rm20 for a small locker for the whole day.  Food like burgers, chicken rice and nasi lemak is available from a cafe next to the wave pool. Each dish costs about Rm30 and comes with a drink and small dessert. Not cheap but those are standard Legoland prices. The food tastes ok. Kids need to be at least 107cm tall to take most of the big slides. For the smaller kids there is still the lazy river and a very elaborate kids water play area which is very elaborate, where my 3 year old still had lots of fun.  There is also an area where kids can build their own Lego boats and race them down a river course. Definitely something that you won't  find at other water parks. My two boys spent a lot of time there. Overall the park exceeded my expectations and we will certainly pay it another visit again. ",4.0
584,Best theme park for families with young children,A good theme park with very age suitable rides and games for pre pri n primary sch children. Parents can join in all the activities and its not boring. Ninjago ride and mummy revenge and dino land ride and the roller coasters are fun for family. I complete the park in abt 6 hrs and we did all the thrill and family rides with my child and thoroughly enjoyed it. The theme park is very well maintained- clean and looks new. Other BEST THING abt the park is Toilets are fantastistically clean (def outshine all theme parks i been to) and theres no big crowd. We never had to queue more than 10 mins for the most popular ride. And you can repeat the rides cos the queues are short. No need special pass either. The legoland water park is suitable for a half day activity. It is much smaller than legoland park but i too feel its just nice. I got to try all the water slides with my child and we complete this park in just 3 hrs. A GOOD workout for both parent and child. Then u can clean up and go back hotel to rest. It is easy to get to legoland fr singapore. Just get on a coach that goes direct thru n fro. Less than an hr if there is no delay at the customs. I have always been skeptical abt this park but now i think this is totally worth multiple repeat visits.,5.0

586,Resort is dated but working towards renovation upgrade,"We made our way to LEGOLAND Resort from Singapore....$70 S by Taxi (a review on here suggested it was only $40).  On entry we found the resort to be dated and The life sized LEGO statues very dirty with finger grime.  Resort is best suited to age group 4 - 8yrs as there is not much to do for older kids.  We visited on a Tuesday so no queues.  There is a lot of construction locally with this area to be a large tourist hub in the very near future.  Our adventure back to Singapore was much cheaper - just $5 ea on the bus which took us to Jurong East MRT Station, then just $1.70 on the MRTDon‚Äôt forget your passports as you will be crossing the border between Singapore & Malaysia.

Please prepare exact notes as there is no change given (all are computerised). Many water slides in the water park. Life jacket were also provided. Food is not an issue here, as there are many restaurant and cafe available.After spending some time in water park, we went to the theme park. Many rides but not enough time as the park closes at 7pm.

591,Fun Under the Sun @ ThemePark,"I guess the Legoland weather is always bright and sunny all year round. It was scorching hot but it does not deter the kids from enjoying themselves in this park.

The tickets were quite pricey and on top of that, there will be an additional charges for photos which was taken during the rides/games (from minimum RM24 to RM70 / it is an option anyway). Food provided at all outlet were good and tasty but again quite pricey (2 kids and 01 adult almost RM90) Safety for all rides are supreme and under close supervision at all times. The Management provides gigantic blade fans but it does not help either. Guests are encourage to take annual pass as you will not have enough time to explore the Legoland in 1 day. *Spare some cash for souvenirs that starts from RM5 onwards. *Standby sunscreen, hat/cap, long sleeves, sport shoes*Dinosaur park - standby to get wet (and they provide drying area too)*Bring your own mineral water in a 2L/3L bottle. (Heaven&Earth 500ml is RM5.00/btl)*Wet tissue for hygenic purposes* No outside food of course except baby food (Baby below 3yrs not encourage to come due to crowd, humidity and hygenic)*Surau was big and comfy.

605,Our Legoland experience,"Our Legoland Malaysia experience with 3D2N stay at Legoland Hotel [Aug 2018, Malaysia 1-week school break] with 2-day Combo park ticket. Family of 5, with kids of 7, 6 and 2 years old.Day 1I decided to have a ""transit"" stay at nearby budget hotel [Link Inn Hotel, Skudai] the day before as we travel from KL, so that we can get good rest and go to Legoland as early as 9am. <- was the plan.. actual was 10am üòÖ, getting the kids ready wasn't straight forward, as usual. So, 1st thing when we arrived at Legoland Hotel, I went to reception to check in and get my purchased combo park tickets. Note that rooms check-in time is 4pm, earlier check in is probable subject to room readiness. This should not be a problem, cos you can always keep your luggage in your car parked at basement parking, or you can keep them at storageüõÖ provided by the hotel at the lobby area. Check in process was smooth even with the large crowd. As soon as I get the ticket, we head straight to the park.It was not that crowded as we visited in mid week <- purposely planned to avoid long queues for rides. 1st ride was Legoland Express, a straight forward selection for a family with 2 yr old boy. The train üöÇ literally chugging around the park, good way to start the long day. Ninjago live show [muppet show] is worth watching, useful tips, get seats at centre for best view of the stage. Rescue academy üë®‚Äçüöíis a very fun family activity, you can treat it as a race with other trucks if you wish and if you don't mind sweating abit more üòÖ. Build&Test is a nice indoor activity and to cool off, kids can build their own cars and buildingsüóºand put them to test. We also spent hours in Miniland, the kids¬† enjoyed it so much. We checked in hotel room at 5pm.Day 2Another round at theme park in the morning to noon. Making rounds of trips on Dragon's Apprentice üê≤ as there was literally no waiting time. Royal Joust is enjoyable for kids below 8yo i personally think. Aquazone Wave Racer is also ok as my daughter enjoyed it a lot. Technic Twister is just like typical spinning cup you always find at any other parks. We finished of the 1st half of the day at Big Shop for obvious reason, how can I let everyone else exiting the park with yellow LEGO shopping bags while I'm empty handed üòâHad lunch at Medini Mall that is right next to the park there are several eateries to choose, as an option to the parks' restaurants. [Parks restaurants offer nice food by the way]. We head to Water Park at 2pm. Spent most of the time at Joker Soaker, lazy river and wave pool üåäuntil almost 5pm. Joker Soaker was awesome!Day 3Checkout day. Before check out, pls ensure that you've unlocked the treasure chest in your hotel room and get the free LEGO gift üéÅ. Overall it was a satisfying trip at the resort hotel and parks combined, a very LEGO experience and most importantly the kids enjoyed every single part of it. Legoland resort is truly designed for children. There are feedbacks at Trip Advisor saying the park rides are boring etc. That's only due to the fact that you're ADULTS who ended up at a wrong place.

This 2 ride are the most recent set up. My kid like the baby dragon roller coasters. The weather is usually hot and you can choose some indoor game/ show which are usually fully air conditioning.  The toilet is clean and well maintained. The food is slightly expensive inside the Legoland and you can choose to eat outside Legoland at the mall of medini.

The rides were average at best, but I would say that toddlers and children would probably enjoy this park more than the adults. I found the staff to be quite depressing in general, the ride operators looked like they hate their jobs and the mood kinda ruins the vibe. The one ride that seems to be remotely interesting with VR was not completely functioning. Barely saw entertainers as well roaming in the park.Wouldn‚Äôt really recommend going here, unless you really love your legos? ",2.0

At this time, Legoland has two areas: the Lego theme park and a water park. There is an oceanarium/aquarium coming soon. One day is not enough to cover everything. Good thing we decided to stay at Legoland hotel for 2 nights and added a 2-day multiple entry pass with our booking. The park has short operating hours (please see their website).

614,A good place for Lego Lover,"The park is not very big.  For the theme park itself, it is about the size of Disneyland HK.  But the facilities are very compact. One next to another, there are quite a lot different games to play.  I think the park is more suitable for kids below teenager unless you are a real Lego lover.  My two boys are 9 and 13 and they really love it.  We stayed in the Somerset Midini which was within walking distance to the park.  It was a nice place to stay although we were not very happy about their housekeeping qualities.  As there are actually not much to do within Johor, we bought annual tickets and my kids visited 6 times to complete every single games at least once.  The queues were very short during weekdays (within 15 mins waiting time) but very crowded on Saturday, even no seats in restaurants.  There is a air conditioned place for building cars ... etc.  We spent at least 4 hours in total over there.  Therefore, if you are a real Lego lover, you can spend a couple days there easily.The other reason made us go for the annual pass is the water park.  We spent 2 days there.  The rides are suitable for family.  There are not strict rules about swimming cap and goggles.  There is a big changing room at the entrance.  Lockers are available.  RM20 for the small one with unlimited access to it which is very convenient.  Don't forget to bring towel and suntan lotion.  In case you don't, there is a shop at the entrance.Regarding restaurants in the park, there are not much choices.  The price is almost double the market price.  But it's acceptable comparing to HK standard.  A set meal at around HK$70 with great taste.If you got a chance to visit the Legoland Hotel, don't forget to visit the lobby.  There are thousands of legos everywhere for visitors to play freely.  My kids spent more then two hours there and my younger rated this the best place in the Lego land.",4.0
615,Happy faces and great service,"We went to the Lego theme park (water park today) and had a enjoyable time, the water ride was the highlight on a very warm today, although be warned you get very very wet, more so than any water ride I have been on - but my kids loved it! Two very positive aspects, the staff in the park were very welcoming and plenty of smiles all around (doesn't always happen when visiting theme parks) and we really enjoyed the food at the Burger Junction. Good quality food and the guy that served me was really friendly and helpful - he seemed to take a genuine interest in our stay and how we were finding the park. Not too much queuing, although probably geared up more for a young family, still a good family day out with some fun rides and the models are pretty cool!",4.0
616,Good with the right aged kids,"We have had an excellent 2 days in the theme park and then the water park. Our kids are 5 and 8 and really enjoyed both. As other reviews say, some parts are in need of a little sprucing up but this is a small price to pay for no queues. We came mid August and the most we queued was 15 mins on either day. We easily filled a day in each park. Food is as average as any other theme park although we did get some good Nasi Lemak. Both days were hot but there is decent shade (Paris Disney take note!) and staff were welcoming and friendly. Lego prices are no cheaper than uk. We stayed in local Airbnb. Beware there is little else in the area and you need to search a bit for eateries/food shopping. Airbnb much cheaper than Legoland hotel. The ‚Äòmall‚Äô next to the park is minimal. Be aware they shut the water park if it rains. If you buy a 2 day ticket for both parks, you can move between them on either day. You cannot take your own food into the park. Would not recommend for older kids, rides too tame for them but great for ours.",4.0
617,Good for a day or two with the kids,"Generally, a place for all things Lego. Kids had a ball there. I would suggest a two-day pass so that you can take your own time to cover everything as some rides had very long queues. Furthermore, it also covers the unfortunate events like rain. The second day was almost rained out, but as we had a room overlooking the park, we could see when it would not be too bad to enter the park. There was a welcome of-sorts early when the park first opens in the morning that was entertaining. Good for the kids and young-at-heart. ",4.0
618,Fantastic time for preschoolers ,"Visited with my 4 and 6 year old kids.  They loved every bit of it.  More laid back and child friendly than other theme parks. Many areas to keep young preschoolers and toddlers occupied. Highly recommended place if you want to relax with kids. It is warm and sunny during the day. Go early in the morning as soon as they open or visit in the afternoon. Plenty of drinking water,  caps and loose cotton cloths recommended. The legoland resort is adjoining and the experience is not complete unless you stay there ! ",5.0
619,The kids enjoyed it,We visited the Waterpark of LEGO land this time round. Rented an air-conditioned cabana which made everything convenient. We can even order food and they would deliver them to our cabana. It‚Äôs air conditioned and a good way to avoid the heat outside.The kids had a really great time with the rides and so were the adults. Need at least half a day to enjoy every ride in the park.,4.0
620,Family friendly,"Purchased the 1Day Legoland e-ticket on TripAdvisor, and went in a group of 7 adults + 1 child. The park was pretty spacious and lots of space for the kids to run around and explore. Only gripe was the inaccurate perpetual waiting time of ""5mins"" being displayed, when it clearly took at least 20mins to queue for certain rides. The rides were definitely very kid friendly, and a great place for the young ones to have lots of fun.",3.0
621,Good education trip for kids,"Perfect for 2 days activities for kids, esp who loves lego. Easy & safe to go around & stop at attractions. Should have more street activities like parade, shows. Opening time would be better to extend till 8pm.",5.0

623,Day Visit to Legoland,The rides were good. The mini city lego site was very attractive for photo opportunities. The playground would be a great attraction for children. ,4.0
624,1st visit with three kids,"Hubby and I went with our kids, ages 6, just under 3, and just over 1. Also brought our domestic helper along. Easy comfortable private car booked separately- long wait at customs but easy, just sit in car! Transport from doorstep to doorstep- highly recommend for those with young kids. Check in was a breeze. Porters, counter staff were friendly, helpful and spoke excellent english. Room was beautiful- we stayed in a pirate theme- puzzle map that had a code for my eldest to solve and go into the treasure chest- small lego packs. Complimentary pack of biscuits on bed. One King size bed, and a double bunk bed, with additional pull out mattress! More than enough space for us. Hot water for shower, clean tiles, clean toilet. Great view from our room- we can see the waterpark. Additional 10 MR each for the two toddlers, to pay at the park counter; and get some swim diapers.Park itself- rides need to be 102? 107cm and above to fully enjoy. But even then, the younger one had many nice playgrounds to run in, and many air-con lego areas to play in. Water park was fantastic- had baby pool, with slides for the small kids, had a beach pool- with waves!! The big kid went crazy in the castle and all the slides.Adults took turns to take the tallest slides with him, need to slide down in rafts.Buffet breakfast part of the room package; we tried buffet dinner on first night. second night walked out to nearby mall. lunches we had the park food- not too bad, pricey but thats to be expected :pClothing wise (prompted by site's questions)Swim wear in water park: bikinis are allowed; but of cos many Asians are worried about sun damage and wore body suits. Muslim guests were in body suits as well. Only thing not allowed are metal bits/buckles- I assume that's cos of risk of injury while sliding down.In teh hot part- T-shirt, shorts, slippers are common. Don't see anyone in spaghetti straps, but I don't think it will be disallowed. Lots of sunscreen, or even bring a sun umbrella! Caps. Hot scorching sun.Highly recommend",5.0
625,Great spot for family weekend vacation ,This is an excellent place especially if you are bringing kids along. The water slides cater to all ages and I would definitely recommend this place as one of the stop over if you are in town. ,4.0
626,I find your lack of safety disturbing,"Avoid the raft waterslides, they can and will capsize violently. Small children will get mauled. Didn't expect this level of safety negligence from Lego.I expect a canned answer from Lego to this review. It can be ignored like all canned answers.",3.0
627,Maintenance Require,"This is the second time visiting the park after 3 years but apparently, nothing much has changed except there is a new ride for Ninjago.  I will say that the place will require good maintenance for their parks as is starting to look rundown due to the poor maintenance where the rides are faulty here and there which is not very ideal for the famous brand name for lego.The park aims to provide entertainment for young kids which this I still agree upon it not for teens as they will find the place boring. As long as the kids like it we will be there again but if the place doesn't do a proper maintenance for the price they are charging worried that people might turn away from the park.Overall rating, I am giving for the park will be average compared to the last review of very good.",3.0
628,Great for 12 and under,"So, this review is from our 12 year old. Loved the park, staff were great, fun rides, good food. All good. From my perspective.  We took the two days pass and spent a very wet day in the water park, and a good day in the theme parkThe water park ‚Äòrides‚Äô were just right for the age group (other than the wave pool which was small and the waves pathetic). Food was ok, and not many people there, so no queues around the park. The them park was nearly empty all day, so no queues at all really. Again, well aimed at children, it was a fun day out for our 12 year old. I think it‚Äôs a bit proxy, but 2 days of entertainment probably made it good value. ",5.0
629,Going downhill slowly,"We usually return to Legoland on every trip to Malaysia, and this last visit was probably our 10th in total spread out over 4 or 5 years. Every time we go back it‚Äôs just a little less fun than the previous time. The rides in the dry park are aimed at children between the ages of 5 and 12. Teenagers would probably find the rides too tame. Younger children would not meet the height requirements for most of the rides. The best ride is the VR coaster, but on this latest visit the VR headsets were not working. The newest Ninjago ride was fun. The motion sensors were something different which I‚Äôve not encountered before on a theme park ride (although it‚Äôs a logical extension of the technology behind, say, Xbox Kinect). The water park has a better spread of rides. The slides and the dinghy ride are aimed at teenagers and adults, and they‚Äôre great fun. There‚Äôs almost always a queue for these even on slow days. Younger children can relax on the lazy river and run around in the water playground (with the obligatory giant bucket!). My best visits have been on weekdays when it‚Äôs not school holidays in Malaysia. It will still be crowded with tourists, but the queues are something like 15 minutes versus an hour when it‚Äôs school holidays. I find there are 2 problems with Legoland Malaysia. First, quite a lot of the park needs maintenance. On this visit alone, the VR headsets on the roller coaster we‚Äôre not working, a slide in the water playground was closed off, some of the seats in the theatre were broken and mouldy, and the outdoor Lego models looked a bit tired and faded. This is disappointing. This is supposed to be Johor Baru‚Äôs top attraction. Having said that, the gents toilets, including the male changing room at the water park, have been refurbished since my last visit, with cracked tiles replaced and drains unblocked. This was much better. My wife tells me that the ladies‚Äô facilities have not had the same maintenance though. Secondly the ticket price list gets more opaque and complicated every time I visit. The one day tickets are expensively priced (as with every other theme park on the planet), but there are no price lists showing other ticket options anywhere at the ticket counter. Even finding prices on the website takes some digging. At the time of writing I believe that a 2 day combined water and dry park ticket costs the same as an annual pass, so you‚Äôd be better off getting that, but I only found this out after a long conversation with staff. It‚Äôs obvious that they want people to buy more expensive tickets, but obfuscation is a pretty unfair way to go about it. I will return, as long as my children enjoy it, but increasingly it‚Äôs becoming a chore to visit rather than the fun place if used to be.",3.0

634,Amazing experience for both LegoLand and Lego Water-Park,"I purchased multiple entry tickets for both Legoland and Lego Water-park on a Saturday and Sunday. I would say it definitely was worth going, the rides at LegoLand are ideal for family and yet entertaining for adults as well. The slides and activities at the water park are pretty decent too. On top of that, the queues for both parks were not that long for a weekend. Overall, a wonderful experience for couples and families!If you are going to the Waterpark, do remember to bring a proper swimming costume or attire. The staff is a little strict on attire (Wore a dry-fit T-shirt but was not allowed on the slide).",5.0
635,the whole family enjoyed our stay.,"not just for children. my grandson and the whole family had a great time and intends to go back. very nice rooms with lots of lego fun stuff. room can accommodate 8 adults. the theme park was fabulous. the water park big. rain or shine, you can have fun.",5.0
636,Fun Family Time,"We visited on the 3rd and 4th of August. It was really hot and humid but overall The theme park was really great, eventho my son is quite short for a 4 year old. They definitely enjoy the theme-park and the water park.  It Isn‚Äôt as crowded as we thought & We bought the 2 days combo tickets, prices are reasonable. You dont have to queue really long, unlike uss. All the staff are really friendly but I had to remove 1 star as one of the staff named Fairoz who was working at the imagination area was extremely rude to me and my husband. My 4 year old saw an ice cream cart filled with lots of ice cream so we decide to get some ice cream and milo for the kids on an extremely hot weather. It was our turn to order and fairoz quickly said to us rudely ‚Äúwe dont sell ice cream and if you want ice cream go get on a restaurant and if you want milo go to pizza mania.‚Äù I told him off , ‚Äú you don‚Äôt have to be rude if you‚Äôre having a bad day.‚Äù. And we walked off. I hope Legoland would do something about this particular staff. I must say everything would have been perfect if it wasn‚Äôt for fairoz. Overall it was awesome and Atleast my son had fun that all matters. We will definitely comeback again when our son grow a little taller.üòù‚ò∫Ô∏è ",4.0

It is expensive, and is definitely a whole day affair to get your moneys worth.",3.0
641,Fun!,"Had a lot of fun here. Just that the locker power machine always runs out & it‚Äôs difficult for me to access my locker. Need to wait for someone working there to come & open it. Then they‚Äôll just ask us to show which locker it is & they‚Äôll open it, but what if that‚Äôs other people‚Äôs locker? They didn‚Äôt even check. They should provide us with some identification of the lockers owner. Some people might take advantage of this and access other people‚Äôs locker right? Also the chairs and table provided at the restaurant in the water park is not enough for visitors. Some people just leave their belongings on the chairs and table provided for people to EAT and goes to play for hours. I was standing while eating because there‚Äôs no chairs and tables available! Everyone should be considerate with each other right? & please keep the things in the lockers provided (even though the lockers is difficult to access because the power is always out) WILL DEFINITELY COME AGAIN BECAUSE THE RIDES WAS FUN & CHALLENGING !! ",5.0
642,Nice Theme Park- Great for young kids,"We visited Legoland on 25th July and stayed at Legoland hotel. The hotel is great and cost efficient with family as kids are easily and conveniently accommodated in bunk beds within the same room but with a pocket door that separates the space as need be.The theme park proved not suitable for my thrill seeking 10 and 12 year olds, so not advisable for older kids. The waterpark is neat but again only great for younger kids, no slide is thrilling enough for over 10 years.Early morning drop off to the airport wasn‚Äôt as easy since the hotel warns that Grab isn‚Äôt that available in the early morning( We we‚Äôre leaving at 6am) yet the hotel transport is about twice the price of a taxi and had to book before 1 am as otherwise the drivers report at 7 am. I had to resort to the taxi I had taken from Singapore as I still had the contacts.Not for me anymore, unless with grandchildrenüòÅ",3.0
643,So many things to do..,"You really do need one full day here, if not longer to fully explore all the rides and attraction. Our 6 and 3 year old had a ball. From doing various rides to driving a car!We are surprised how good it is. Food wise, we had lunch at the pasta restaurant. Whilst the pasta looked good, the pizza tasted foul.. best to try out other restaurants.",5.0
644,Worth with the ticket price,"Been there with family plus parent. Buy the ticket from one of travel agent in Jakarta. They offer us with a cheap price compare with the official ticket from legoland web portal.The locaton is quite far from the city center, we take a grab to go there instead of bus, since we also take our parent to go with us. The area is so big and hot, we only had a chance to experience 3 rides but it really makes us happy. If you plan to go there, please prepare the hat and sunglasses, it really help to avoid dehidration. Better to equipped your self with the plastic raincoat also since sometimes there's a rain for a while. The store inside the legolans also provide it anyway if you want to pay more :-)We prefer to enjoy the rides first and having a lunch outside the area because there's a lot more choice of resto.Over all the Johor Bahru Lego land is just worth with the price.",3.0
645, Better alternative to Universal Studios Singapore,"Legoland is not as crowded as Universal Studios Singapore. Legoland is accessible from Singapore by bus, taxi or car-for-hire. What I like most is the roller coaster with VR. In USS, they only have 3D or 4D, if I'm not mistaken.",4.0

647,Needs some maintenance,"The park is well planned and, if not busy, is something that will entertain a family with young kids aged 3-13 for a day. That's enough time to get around most of the rides - on busier times two days would do it with a lot of queuing. The staff are friendly and the range of features is good but a lot of the interactive elements are not working and the lego models have clearly aged in the tropical sun and rain. A good clean with soap and water would help many of them and bring it up to the standard most would expect from a brand like Lego.",3.0
648,Fun Time ,Went during off peak season and a slighty raining day so there were not many visitors around. Short waiting time and almost no queue. Rides were fun and we liked that rides are interactive. Our fave one is the Ninjago. There are playgrounds around too for free play. Only slight set back is limited rides for children 3 and below. Alot of rides were for aged 4 and up. Will return again. ,4.0
649,Worth a Visit,"Visited Legoland in early April. Absolutely loved the theme park, rides, stores and eateries inside.The Star Wars Lego figurines really caught my eye! However, you should definitely check the weather forecast before you plan your trip to Legoland. The front desk neither warns you, nor refunds money. Hence its such a waste of a day to spend your time at the theme park with all the rides closed! ",3.0
650,Tired and run down,"We went with great expectation of a grand entrance and a fantastic Lego experience. What we got was renovations that made the grand entrance a walk through a work site to the entrance where the only wonder was the noise of heavy machinery. The outdoor Lego figures were faded to the point where red was pink and did I mention they were also really dusty and dirty like no one has ever once bothered to clean them? The entire park felt tired and old and it was very evident that despite a good turn out of people on a regular basis, no money was being spent maintaining the park let alone upgrading it. Though they have money to build an aquarium which one can only view as a desperate attempt to attract customers rather than actually focus on Lego. For a place called Lego land there wasn't much Lego to be seen. The park looks huge but you can easily get through in a mere 5-6 hours.The 4D experience was more like a slum experience. The foam and water machines were broken which meant they consistently leaked all over the unlucky people to sit beneath them. The floors were torn and aged and the chairs themselves were missing huge chunks of foam. The whole place smelled of stale water and damp. The roller coasters were ok with the best rides being the interactive ones. Many photo of the ride kiosks were shut down though. Now I'll also mention. Lego land is pretty sparse so how do they fill up room and make it feel full? About 1/3 of the park is committed to sideshow alley which is $10 a pop. What the hell???? It's Lego land not the fair! If I wanted side show alley why would I go to Legoland? Many of the little food outlets were closed and the toilets? The cleaners were there permanently but still managed to run out of toilet paper. The AC were that tired it was more a warm air so there was no relief from heat or humidity even when getting food which by the way was fast but really expensive and not terribly amazing. The Lego was also expensive compared to what I could buy it for at home thus we did not buy a single Lego set. Each section of Lego land had a huge push on selling their Lego theme on the kids. In summary. An exhausted place with staff who seem just as sad as the joint itself. Maybe Legoland was amazing when it first opened but today? What a let down, and something as simple as a coat of paint with staff filled with wonder could turn it around. Thankfully the kids still had a great time but compared to Santosa Island on Singapore or any attraction on Singapore the kids had way more fun there and it didn't cost us half as much as Lego-flop. Will I recommend or go back? Never!!!! Get your act together Lego-land. ",2.0

After the final show at 6pm I was overwhelmed and sad that it was all over. This is the best legoland in the world and I think the attitude and the hospitality of the Malay people plays a big part in making this place a success. Thoroughly recommend this place to anyone and suggest getting a two day pass a it‚Äôs impossible to see everything in a day. ,5.0

My older child (6 years) could repeat the rides he loved and there was also enough to do for my younger one (2 years who luckily didn't have to pay).The first time we went (last year) we had enough time to also go to the waterpark which was nice. This year we couldn't due to the many repeats and time spent in the Lego shop.Overall really nice and recommendable.",4.0
656,Great theme park ,The park itself does not look really huge on the map but we did spend the whole day in there playing everything. Very young children might not be able to play much inside but kids 100 cm and over 5 years old is definitely a go. Food price inside the park is quite rip-off however but I would really recommend eating at Burger Junction instead of the famous Pizza Mania. Food at burger junction is tastier and way fresher. Do buy the 2-day park combo if you aren‚Äôt short on time or already the Legoland resort‚Äôs guests. I don‚Äôt recommend the 1-day park combo because you will not have enough time to play everything and jump to the water park before it closes. ,4.0
657,An exciting experience for the kids,"I went to theme park only, on weekdays.  There is a construction going on to the entrance, so for the first timer like me, we are quite lost to find the entrance from the parking area.  Luckily there are a few people arrive, so we just follow them.Even though there is no long queue at the ticketing counter, and it is not weekend or school holidays, the waiting is quite long.  It takes about 20 minutes to purchase the tickets, and I don't know why the counter takes quite long to calculate the amount of the ticket value for us (4 adults, 3 kids, and 2 babies FOC).  It's not only me, because I notice the person before me also wait for quite sometime to purchase a ticket.The park itself is great, my kids really enjoy all the attractions inside, my complaint is only there is not enough time to explore and try everything even though we spent time there from 12 till the closing time at 6PM.Easy to find a place to sit and toilets all along the park, as we have kids and babies, it is quite important.  Food is quite expensive (for us anyway), average you need rm30 above per meal per person.  Drink price is quite ok, RM3-5 per bottle.Definitely will go again, but next time I think I will purchase an online ticket to skip the hassle of waiting at the counter.",4.0

663,Great theme park for young ones,"We visited LEGOLAND theme park and water park after visited Universal Studios in Singapore. We have 7,8,9 yr olds boys and girl. They had a good time but we think it's more suitable for younger kids. Expectation wise, take a notch down from Universal, including the size of the park, level of excitement, organization and food etc. We stayed at the LEGOLAND hotel and purchased entrance tickets and express passes trying to maximize our visit. It was not that busy we could get away with just waiting for 10-20 minutes. The express passes doesn't give you access to all rides, only 6-7 on top of my mind. Some rides were closed for maintenance on our first day. At some rides we still have to push our way through even we had the express pass.",4.0

We did two days with the Waterpark (a half day only needed or skip it) so our son could go back to the Leo pRk and redo rides. Good park if you child is a lego fan nut Sentosa probably has more thrills and double the queueing time though.",3.0
676,Expensive Theme Park in Johor,"This place is not hard to get to if you are driving from Singapore. However, the lack of places for us to hide from the sun and rain puts us off. The prices of the food and drinks, hotel accomodation & entrance tickets is also very expensive. We only came once and was telling ourselves that we wont come back so soon in the near future.",3.0

678,Very Entertaining but lacks Things to do for babies/young toddlers,"We went to Legoland Malaysia during the last school holidays in June and boy, did we have good fun!. We went to the Theme Park with our 4 year old daughter and baby (1 year old), and our daughter thoroughly enjoyed herself. There are many rides which require a minimum height requirement though, so if your young child is a bit on the smaller side, i would suggest that you call and find out what the minimum height requirement is rather than just going by age. There were rides which she could go on herself as well as the others which would require an adult following her. However, there are also quite a number of rides which she could not do as these were meant for older children. For the baby, there was nothing he could do except my husband or i taking turns following our daughter and the other 1 of us sitting outside the ride area with the baby. Needless to say he got quite cranky in the sun and when we did go to the baby area (where the big half giraffe is), he enjoyed himself there too. Am not too sure about this, but there may be more activities families with young toddlers could do in the water park, if compared to the theme park. Not much food options though, and nearly all places to eat in the theme park only served the same food (think fried chicken, burgers, etc). The burger was undercooked and my daughter had some diarrhea thereafter. That said, we still had a fab time and would definitely recommend going to families with older children as they would be able to join most, if not, all rides. A must-do, entertaining place.",4.0

680,Definitely not top class,"As we were in Singapore we thought it would be a good idea to visit the nearby Legoland Resort in Malaysia. Getting there was easy, but expensive. Rather than getting a tour bus we opted for a chauffeured car. That meant door to door and no getting out and in of the car at the border as well as being able to set your own time to travel. It took in excess of an hour to travel and then we still had a bit of a walk (through what appeared to be a building site) to get to the resort which didn‚Äôt open until 10:00. Note there are two separate parks with separate entrance fees so be prepared. The park feels tired and it was not full if visitors when we were there. The good news - no queuing for anything. Another good thing - the food is reasonably priced but limited. Young children will enjoy the park (or parks) but the more older will wonder at what the ‚Äúgo‚Äù is. They really missed the opportunity to properly showcase LEGO in my opinion but the Star Wars exhibition was good. ",3.0

683,Very dissappointing,Paid for Legoland ( full price) from Chinatown visitor centre through a tour company as we had done previously for Sentosa etc. All a good way to book. However on arrival at legoland  6 of the most significant rides were closed. Also we were told on arrival that the waterworld is now a different park and would require an upgrade at a cost of approx. SG$68. They wouldn't even discuss a discount due to the rides being closed. Also a pretty big day and if had known would not have gone. Rest of Singapore was fantastic.,1.0

Rode it twice üòäMy son is crazy about Ninjago and almost flipped when he entered the Ninjago area. Overall it's a good experience for us.

690,Fun overall. Good visit.,"Hotel: 3/5- Nice themed room. Customer service also ok. The treasure box gift was very disappointing (got a minifigure and a keychain), my son just stared at it and walked off to play with the duplo set they provide in the room. The food was very mediocre for the price. The real issue for me is the greed, the hotel charges a 3yr old RM70+ for the buffet. the other restaurant is a sushi joint, and an italian restaurant with like 10 tables. so most likely you will end up at the crap buffet joint. The activities for kids at the hotel is good though. Waterpark: 4/5- waterpark is fun. lockers are RM19 for a small locker (fits maybe 1 backpack and a handbag. and bring your own towel because it was something stupid like RM50+ per towel if not mistaken. Overall was a fun trip, worth visiting if you have 3-8yo kid. Themepark: 4/5- cool place. the lego people walkin around and the rides were pretty fun. if going with young kids check the height restrictions first. better than going and your kid cant get on 50% of the rides will kid of suck. most of the rides 102cm tall is a safe bet. went in around 10am and left at 6pm. fun day. Food is ok, roughly around RM35/person with a drink and fruit/dessert. and bring an umbrella, but preferably a raincoat as malaysia loves its rain. dont know about the price of the legoland raincoat but the low quality cap's were around RM50+ if i remember correctly. Wouldnt mind paying that for a quality cap. but it was just rubbish. so yeah. its a shame Lego didnt put as much effort into all their products as they do their bricks.",4.0

697,Everything is Awesome!,"We're family of 5 with kids age 14, 12, and 10 yo. It was our 1st time to Legoland Malaysia themed park, and we would like to share our experience.1. We bought 2-days combo themed park & waterpark tickets from Legoland Malaysia Resort official website a day before our arrival with 20% discount offer. After we checked-in at Legoland Hotel, we found out that we can get cheaper 2-days combo themed park & waterpark tickets at hotel reception. So we suggest you to check first before making any ticket purchase.2. Enter themed park as soon as it open so you have enough time to explore the entire park. Because it's hugeeee...!! Huge park with a lot of rides. I must admit that at first I kind of underestimate the park. I saw many other families with small kids, since I have teenagers I thought I would finished the park earlier. But I was wrong. We made our way out of the park at closing time :p3. When we were there a week ago, it was school holidays but the crowd was ok. There were no long queues at each ride. So there's no need to buy Hero Access Pass. Still we prepared  for the worst, so we chose to ride one of ""always in-demand Legoland attractions"" first: The Great Lego Race VR coaster. But unfortunately it was slightly rain so the ride was unavailable until the rain stop. You might anticipate other ""epic rides"": The Dragon (at Lego Kingdoms), Lego Ninjago The Ride (at Lego Ninjago World), Observation Tower (at Imagination), Lost Kingdom Adventure, and Dino Island (both at Land of Adventure). And don't miss 4D movie at Lego Studio.4. If your kids interested in joining one of Lego Academy's robotic class, sign up as soon as you enter the park because there were only limited slots per day.",5.0
698,Fun family visit,"We had a great day exploring Legoland Malaysia and probably could have easily spent a second day there as we missed out on the workshops so the kids could get some rides in. The queues were no where near as long as attractions in Singapore, but it also probably helped that we timed our visit for a Monday. The food available was good and fairly reasonably priced. We did get caught in a massive storm in the early afternoon. Luckily our ticket type allowed same day re-entry so we escaped the flooding park to dry off for a few hours in our room at the Legoland resort. We then returned for the last hour the park was open to finish our visit. Overall it was a great park for our family (kids 7 & 10), not sure teenagers would find it as entertaining. Due to the storm we never made it to the waterpark.",5.0

705,Changes to baby care room access,"Came back here as my girl loves this place so much. They had a change in policy for baby care room though and that's the reason why I am reviewing this again.The baby care room is now open only on Saturdays and Selected public holidays, so please take note. Also, they do not allow the daddies in. This aspect is honestly rather disappointing. Daddies cannot feed baby? Daddies cannot change diapers? Daddies cannot put baby to sleep? The only thing my husband would be incapable of doing is to latch my baby to breastfeed. Otherwise he would have been able to help me up with the baby while I enjoy rides with my girl. But because of this new policy, my girl was somewhat disappointed that I cannot go do some of the rides with her as my baby needs his nap and I am the one allowed inside. I hope Legoland can review this policy and if really necessary, at least separate the area to allow daddies access to changing room and feeding room.Overall, my girl still enjoys herself and we will still come back, but maybe when my baby is much older.

Note down the various show times at different locations before your day commences so you maximise your time there. Start Legoland BY TURNING RIGHT/beginning. Walk AWAY from the water zone. You will end off at the sheltered play zone at the end. Parking is a distance off so be prepared for a 5- 8 Min slow walk.You can fill up water bottles with free water from the cafeterias.

715,Terrible park attendant at Beetle Bounce,"I was in Legoland Malaysia during the June school holidays with my little girl and my Niece and Nephew. It was my first time there but my Niece and Nephew had been there before. The park attendant for Beetle Bounce was a young lady (think her name was Amelia), and she was the most rude and unhappy park attendant i‚Äôve Come across. She was rude to us with her instructions ‚ÄúI said Arms away, not arms up‚Äù and was very rough when she help to belt up my little girl. It was our second ride of the day and her lack of service really spoiled the experience for us. When we complained about her to the supervisor and she came to explain herself, she was very defensive and once again rude and in the end, wanted to close off the chapter with ‚Äúok i‚Äôm Sorry ok?‚Äù In the most disgruntled manner. I think Legoland needs to seriously evaluate the staff they hire to attend the rides because they can seriously ruin the fun or mood of any customer. Theme Parks are suppose to be a happy place and as staff members, you represent the brand and is critical to overall experience of the customer. Luckily the rest of the park attendants were ok so the rest of the trip was good for us.",3.0

Sculptures, rides, and even signs. Plenty of things to enjoy as an adult, It was worth of the price. It was weekdays, so there weren‚Äôt many people, which let me ride a number of times when I like.

Also not enough food courts inside the Park (you can not leave the park and return back)))) Most of them were closed. In the Boat Ride you will be completely wet and soak. Also you can not change the money inside the park.My family and me (4 pers) have traveled from Singapore to Johor Baru by bus, total expenses 80 USD for transport and 160 USD for 3 adults and 1 child.

There are plenty of choices both for the very young and teenagers (and as our children span both ages, this is useful). Rides are generally of good quality, and (on a weekday when we visited) with very short queuing times.The layout is good and compact- it is possible to go around the whole park in just a few short hours.The water park has an excellent variety of rides and activities to keep all the family very happy. However, the not so good:Mainly the food- on any given day, many F&B outlets closed. The quality of the food, whether Asian (nasi lemak, noodles, curry) or Western (sandwiches, wraps, chicken lasagne) was generally very poor. Sandwiches and wraps particularly so, with a reduced selection and very soggy and sad looking salad fillings. The landscaping has been started, but with little consideration to providing additional shade, or for how the park looks from aerial views obtained from the observation tower and hotel (it resembles a rather ugly industrial park in places, rather than a well-landscaped recreational park).

725,Fun For Kids,This was our second visit to Legoland Malaysia we were there for a week so we got the annual passes. This place is designed for kids as an adult you might think it‚Äôs boring as they don‚Äôt have any thrill rides like other amusement parks that being said kids will love it. My boys 7 and 3 absolutely loved the place they could get on almost all the rides they have many play areas which they also loved. Even though the park is already showing it‚Äôs age and a lot of the Lego figures look scruffy the kids don‚Äôt care they just love taking rides watching the shows and all the colourful exhibits really attract them. They are adding a new aquarium which I think will be opening soon. The water park is also very good geared towards younger children but they also have some rides the adults would enjoy too. My kids loved the water park so much we ended up going 4 times. Again if you are traveling with kids both the parks are fantastic they will really enjoy them but as an adult you might wanna go somewhere else.,4.0
726,Nice place for the not too young and not too old,My 4-7 year old kids enjoyed the place. There were hardly queues even if there were it takes about 5-10 mins wait. Kids at this age would not mind doing the same ride over and over again. The staff was helpful. The place was clean. Food were decent. The park do look a little aged and if spruce up could be done it will be better. The park was generally hot. There were limited sheltered areas to shield from sun or rain. If more sheltered walkway is provided will be good.,4.0

729,Great time spent!,"Legoland had 2 parks - Adults / Children - but both are within the same compound. It was really fun as my initial thoughts was that it will be boring. Legoland have some really exciting roller coaster rides. The theme park is mostly open spaced, so when it rains, you will get stranded quite easily. There is a miniature legoland and it is amazing! It looks so flawless and we spend about an hour or so in there just snapping pictures. They have a water theme park as well, but decided to give it a miss. Will definitely want to try it the next time. When we were there, we saw that they are in the midst of doing a sea aquarium by 2018/19, so I'd expect that place to be filled with more families. We bought a lot of souvenirs in the shops and if you're a lego fan, you're in for a treat!",4.0
730,Baby's 1st Birthday in Legoland,"Legoland Malaysia is lovely, but somehow misses the mark of other amusement parks. The highlights are the puppet Ninjago show and of course the Lego MiniLand which is so unique in that it focuses on landmarks in Asia. The craftsmanship was incredible and the facts were interesting as well. We went on a Saturday, on a long weekend, and the park was a ghost town. We sat down for lunch at noon and we were the only family in there. It was kind of unsettling. And there was no music in the park which was strange for us, as the music helps set your mood! The park atmosphere left something to be desired. You can see the wear and tear on the attractions and the staff. It's missing the wow factor, but it was still a decent visit.",3.0

732,Fun day out,Really fun. Day with children aged 7 they were able to go on all rides. Would suggest bring own food as the food in park not great. Would have given a 4 but two of major attractions where closed for maintenance at same time. ,3.0

735,Wasn't as exciting as made out to be,"Legoland is for kids between 4-8 years period. A couple of interesting rides for maybe elder ones, but not wort the price you spend. Travelling from Singapore (45-50 min drive by private cab) on a weekday with 12 year olds, had enough time to take every single ride multiple times as there was no crowd. We were almost through by 3 pm. World monuments created using lego is brilliant. Legoland pales in comparison to a Universal Studio in Singapore or Disneyland. If you have been to either of the two, you can skip this one. If you have kids between 4-8, you can still have some fun here.",3.0
736,Our first time at any Legoland!,We are doing this review from our kids point of view because we feel since this place is catered to and for them that their opinion is what counts our daughters are 7 and 4. we will give the parents perspective as well.Kids: We loved the Ninjago ride and the 2 roller coasters. The 4D theater was really cool too. the park was HUGE with so much stuff to do. we didn't like the mummy ride much because it was a little scary. we also LOVED the hotel. the hotel was amazing and so much fun. it was huge with a big play area and really cool pool at the top.parents: we really enjoyed ourself at the park. we ourselves are lego fans so it wasn't just a pleasant experience for our kids. the park was nice but there is construction still going on so the entrance isn't so magical but once everything is done it will be pretty extravagant. the park is perfect for kids between 5-10 given the range of attractions they have but anyone older and they might find it kind of boring unless they are just huge lego fanatics. Kids any younger and they wont really get to enjoy the park. We also got a private tour of the hotel.,5.0
737,Awesome Time,Been here with my family from overseas to celebrate an occassion. Travelled from Singapore to Malaysia. Place is definitely awesome for both young and adult. Enjoyed their rides and food. Got several Lego souvenirs for my son!Amazing place! Can't wait to be back.,5.0
738,Fun for kids,We made a detour here for a special day out for our sons birthday. it didn't quite live up to our expectations. I'm not sure if it was because a lot of rides were closed. It just didn't have the wow moment we were hoping for. A lot of the rides were very similar. Some of the areas are looking like they need some attention. Our son still loved it because it's Legoland and we had a fun family day out.,4.0
739,Do not visit if you have been to better places! ,Sad for me I went to Legoland dubai first before visiting here in Johor. The place was not worth the money. They could have done better like better maintenance of the whole place. But yeah I forgot the Virtual ride I must admit was good though. But for the rest its ordinary. Not worth the money and the travel from KL. Okay sorry maybe for the kids yes they would love it but for the adults who had been to other places well better think about visitinf this place.,3.0
740,No reason to go if you do not have a child you can play with!,"I had a bad experience visiting this place. My wife and I are a middle aged Childless couple and started feeling terrible the moment we entered. Keep this in mind, this place is only fun if you have a child you can play with.Ordinary rides and lego's everywhere.Ladies (and Men), get knocked up, wait a couple more years and then go. I bet the experience would be awesome.",2.0
741,Just Lego,"Had a chance to visit Legoland Malaysia when our company have organized a company's team bonding/outing. From the time we are about to start our program, it rained heavily. We are all stuck in the entrance's shop store. Nothing to do but to answer the rest pf the questions in our game by asking the staffs. All in all, we didnt enjoy our trip here. Have not tried any rides, only sight seeing. Its not easy to find a shade when it rains and when its hot and sunny. Ok for first timers, at least have experienced to see and witness how legoland is. But to come back here again, i dont think so. ",2.0
742,Nice but is really designed for 4-12 yr olds,"The theme park is reasonably well maintained. Travelling with 2, 4 and 15 year olds meant that we have varying demands and we felt that the age group that Legoland best catered for would be 5 to 12 year olds. Our 15 yr old was bored fairly quickly and our 4 yr old was still too small for many of the rides.",3.0

744,We loved it!,"Two adults and a 10 year old Lego fanatic took a day trip from Singapore. Would recommend a private transfer as it was so easy to get to and from Malaysia including staying in the car while passing through immigration. Started at Legoland park and there was heaps for us to do, I will say that the rides probably wont satisfy a teenager though. We loved the Ningago ride and the train. The lego structures from around the world were great to see.After about 2.5 hours we headed across to the waterpark. The lockers were great but you will need local currency RM to access them. They were very affordable and easy to use with plenty of staff around to help if needed. All the slides were fantastic and there was something for all ages. The main pool with mega screen showing lego movies was awesome. The ground does get hot so keep your thongs with you so you can move from slide to slide without losing skin. A great day trip.",5.0
745,One of a kind experience ,"I visited this place recently with my kids. We travelled from Singapore. There are many traveling options but I recommend if you have young kids and baggage to take a taxi from Singapore so that you don‚Äôt have queue and carry luggage‚Äôs at the immigration. It will cost you about $90 per trip and there are taxi operators providing this service.You can buy tickets at the gate or you may buy online. However, buying tickets on line on the official site is a cumbersome task. But there are third party web sites offering the service (Klook). Avoid buying tickets at the location from individual. There are day tickets as well as combo tickets . We opted for combo as we could switch between the water park and main park with the combo ticket.For main park it will take one day and for water park 1/2 day is enough.The climate is very hot and recommend sun cream , shades and hats and plenty of water.There are activities for kids below (3) entry is free.",5.0
746,Family fun time,"Well I can say that we did enjoy our time in Legoland. Interesting and beautiful displays in the Miniland. Activity though not that so adrenalin pumping fun stuff, it was enjoyable to say the least. However, I was very disappointed with the food options in the eating outlets. The menu was not interesting at all and practically no choice given. Plus the ever so ridiculous expensive for price charged. Very disappointing. ",3.0
747,Fun in the sun... for kids (and the young at heart),"This is my THIRD visit to LEGOLand so yes, the theme park has its unique allure. But let me get this out of the way, it is no Disneyland or Universal Studios, and is best enjoyed by those between 4-12. Why? Because the rides are mild and will not appease the adrenaline junkie teenager. And well, for all those LEGO Experts out there, you'll probably be there for your kids, eh (and the LEGO Star Wars)?So what is it about LEGOLand that made me a repeat visitor then? Well to put it simply, its charm lies in its diversity. Disneyland has its castles, LEGOLand has its Miniland: iconic landmarks made entirely of LEGO bricks! Granted, some of these are in serious need of maintenance since the tropical weather hasn't been kind to them colourful LEGO bricks, and some of the mechanisms seem to have failed altogether. However, rising majestically within is Malaysia's very own pride and joy, the Petronas Twin Towers. Unlike the faded airport, this landmark has been completely rebricked (it was ""under maintenance"" this time last year). Hopefully LEGOLand would continue with their rebricking efforts (I'm sure they wouldn't be short of willing volunteers too!). But yeah, the awe factor here kinda wears out after one visit since there are hardly any new additions. And LEGOLand peeps, if you're reading this, at least rebrick the tired man snoring beside the BIG shop... he's badly faded, and I noticed visitors are avoiding him already (they used to sit beside him, now they're sitting AWAY from him!).Thrill rides? Well, the Dragon ride is as thrilling as it gets. Probably three high speed swerves, and you're done. If there isn't a crowd, then you could have another go... and another... and another. Hopefully, your knees get weak thereafter. No, it's no Space Mountain, but for a 7 year old, it's enough for him to gain his badge of courage and bragging rights to having sat on a roller-coaster. Alternatively, you could check out their latest ride, the Great Lego Race (VR-Coaster). Interesting, this. Reminds me of Wreck-It-Ralph. There's also flume-ride at Dino Island, and well, you can read about all the rides LEGOLand has to offer in their website (there's quite a list actually!). My boys' favourite? Definitely the Ninja-Go ride! I've lost count of how many rounds they've gone on this.  What sets LEGOLand apart from other theme parks is of course, the LEGO bricks and it's only natural that they have set out play areas to let your imagination run wild. There's the Build & Test, Mindstorm and the Academy that can literally keep your kid (whether actual or metaphorical) entertained for hours, especially when you need to escape the heat (or rain).There are a couple of credible dining options which do not charge you an arm and a leg, but as some have observed, many of the kiosks are no longer in operation (which is pretty disappointing). My particular favourite? King's Grill. Alternatively, there are some dining options at Medini Mall, just in front of the LEGOLand entrance.As the boys were feeling under the weather this round, we skipped the WaterPark. On the last couple of occasions that we did make it there, Build-A-Raft River and Joker Soaker were the boys' favourite hangout. These alone kept them occupied for a couple of hours. It's a supplementary park, not to be compared with dedicated water theme parks. A good way to cool down although one has to be mindful that the storms usually arrive in the evening. If you only have a day to spare, do check out the weather forecast since the WaterPark closes at the very first signs of lightning, but if you're on a combo ticket, you can still enjoy the 4D shows and indoor attractions at the park.",4.0
748,Rating poor due to locker issue & limited food options,"We travelled from Singapore (on vacation from Sydney ) with the kids to visit LEGOland. We had purchased tickets for both water park & the amusement park. We were advised to visit the water park first since there was some thunderstorms warning later in the day. As soon as we entered we headed to put our bag in the locker only to find out that the machine only accepted cash that too in local currency, upon seeking assistance we were asked to purchase something from the gift shop using Singapore currency for which they would give us change back in local currency. I was very disappointed to find this out as we weren‚Äôt carrying much cash and were depending on credit card as everywhere else in Singapore it was used and accepted, so we decided to carry our bag in the water park because after lunch we were to visit the amusement park and would hire the locker there with our limited cash as we only had enough to rent the locker once. Most of the rides at the water park were under maintenance even then the kids enjoyed with whatever was available. Around 12:00 pm we headed to the amusement park for lunch and rides only to find out most of the food places were closed and we had to depend on the pizzas which were complete rubbish, super doughy and the sauce was very watery. We managed to have a bite or two and headed off to the rides. The rides were fun but I was worried that the kids would get hungry soon since they had not eaten properly and be advised they don‚Äôt allow any outside food ( bags were checked at the entrance)There was water & ice cream at most places selling so that made the kids happy as it was a hot day. My only question to the authorities is if you are not allowing people to carry any outside food then at least be considerate enough to provide enough eating options inside. ",2.0

There are a couple of rides that required kids being 6years old. Do check at the information board at every ride. I am gald we came on a weekday as queue were within 10mins for most ride.

751,Not worth it,"Went water theme park for half a day and LEGOland for 1 day.Not many things to play especially for water theme park.

757,Lots to do for families ,We visited Legoland Malaysia and stayed at the resort. We flew into Changi Airport and took a bus to Legoland. The border crossing into Malaysia wasn't too bad; it took around 45 minutes.The resort caters well to young kids. I think primary aged kids will love it. Our daughter is nearly 5 years old and she was really happy. The check-in process was really slow. When we got to our room I thought it was clean but a bit run down. The only big issue was the shower overflowing across half the bathroom every time it was used.We visited the park over two days. There are a lot of rides and games for the little ones but not a lot of shelter so it is important to bring a hat and use sunscreen. Each zone in the park has one or more souvenir stores. If you want to buy something but don't want to carry it around you can ask the store to send it to the exit for collection as you leave.You can't bring food into the park but you can take water.We spent about 8 hours total in the park over two days but with an older child you might spend longer.There are a lot of restaurants to choose from for lunch or snacks. They aren't too expensive. We had lunch with fish for 3 people for less than $100 ringgit. The park is very clean and the toilet facilities are good. All the staff we dealt with were lovely and spoke good English. ,4.0

My favorite part is the VR roller coaster. I really really enjoyed that one. Other than that, I honestly can't remember what other things I did. The kids, however, enjoyed the trip. They loved the robot building. If you have kids, you must go here. Otherwise, you are not missing much.",3.0

The same process when you go back to singapore where ever is your drop off point that would be also ypur pick up point at legoland you need to pay 5 ringgit to the bus and they will drop you off to jurong east station.

766,Fun for the family but water park is ....,"This is my 2nd time visiting the LEGOLAND and this time we were able to stay at the Hotel and visit the Water Park as well. Unfortunately i gave only average stars instead of 5 this time...We purchased the 2 day combo as it is more worth it. I din know that both days you can entered the theme park and water park as well...The rides were fun as usual. Queues were short and now the life jacket for kids are better and easier to put on.The shop is disappointing as some polo T, popular items were not replenished. And some restaurant is not open also. luckily we had our lunch outside KFC but it disappointing. At times some booth had no one manning the counter. We wanted to play the ""rope climbing"" but no one is there, Stars wars and movie watching  as well. As for the water park, I would recommend kids below primary school age 7 and below to skip this. My kids only want to stay in the baby pool and the raft ride is not operational... We went to a smaller slides area and the slides are dangerous in my opinion to kids (tried personally). In the end we came out early from the water park as most of the slides are only suitable for adults. We ended up going back to hotel swimming pool to play instead...",3.0

Due to the limited restaurants open, the food by the fire station almost ran out when it was our turn to order.

768,Second Visit,I love Legoland Johor. Its a lively place for both kids and adults. The staffs are well trained. It is close to second Singapore- Malaysia causeway. The adjacent hotels are nicely decorated to welcome the guests. This is our second visit after a gap of 5 years!,5.0
769,"Average Theme Park, You Get What You Pay For","We went to Legoland at the insistence of my 7 year old son - several of his friends have been, and he wanted to go.  So our family of four, including my son and 10 year old daughter, spent two days, one for the water park and one for the dry side.  Overall, the kids had a really good time...but the impression that we had as parents is that Legoland just need to try harder, and this for sure will be our one and only visit. Pros-- The parks are manageable between 2 days - not too large that you feel like you're missing something, but large enough to keep us entertained. -- There were a few interesting rides that the kids had not experienced at other theme parks, like the driving school and VR Roller coaster.  They also really enjoyed The Dragon's Apprentice. -- This was just not a popular theme park - we went on a Thursday and Friday of Spring Break - a time you would think would be popular.  But, there are just not a lot of people who go - the good thing is that this meant there were virtually no lines for the rides. Cons-- The park is really designed for children 8 and under.  My 10 year old had a good time, but there were really only a few things that appealed to her. -- The interactive lego classes seemed interesting, and tied into the theme, but misplaced.  Who can convince their kids to spend 45 minutes during the middle of the day to do robotics?  Maybe offer these in the evening after the rides shut down?  Or perhaps the sessions could be less than 45 minutes?  -- Several things were closed on the day we went, w/o warning and w/ no discount.  On the dry side, most of the eating venues were shut down, as was the Dino Island Ride.  On the wet side, the lazy river was shut down (?!?), several of the stations in Imagination Station and one of the few slides they have.  Even when places were open, like the food stands, they didn't have all of the items listed on the menu - one place was completely out of ice cream1 We were so disappointed - while you see this at other theme parks, this one is so small, if one or two things aren't operating, it makes a big difference. The park either needs to offer some sort of discount or warn people before purchasing a ticket that you won't get the full experience. All in all, the kids had a good time, but it wasn't the high quality theme park experience you come to expect.  As a previous reviewer says, it's nothing like Disney, but honestly, it's not even to the quality of smaller regional parks we've been to in other part of Malaysia, Hong Kong and China.  If you go, I'd recommend for younger children and adjust your expectations!",3.0
770,Be Prepared. This is not Disneyland,"After 8 hours of being stuck in the reputable Singapore-Johor jam, the impression was naturally marred. Although I have been to the theme park once a few years back, I didn't felt that the park did justice to the lego blocks creation. Poor maintenance of Miniland where the white bricks on famous landmarks were discolored (most probably due to weather) and micro-structures were broken and not repaired.Didn't try many rides, as most were not available during day of visit. Ninjago was a good experience of VR + Ride. Great fun for adult and kids alike. Be prepared to exit the ride with sore arms. Souvenir shops were unexciting. The shelves were empty and popular products were not replenished. I really thought they could do better after years of operation, but apparently no.",3.0

779,Worth the trip but some hassles involved,"We are family of 4 with 2 primary school aged kids. Came on 31 March - public holiday weekend for Singapore and 'western' countries. Of course for most of Asia, Easter is not a public holiday. The park itself was relatively quiet. The queues were short and therefore we wasted money on Hero Passes. They only apply to a few rides anyway.Getting from Singapore to JB has always been frustrating. This is to do with the very slow and congested causeway and Malaysian Customs / Immigration. The 2nd link was just as bad but being Good Friday it was super busy. It took us 6 hours to get from Changi Airport to Legoland with a private taxi. That's another review.This Legoland is similar but smaller to the one in California. The rides were OK but more suitable for younger kids. My 9 year old was getting bored, the 7 year still found it interesting. Both kids are crazy about Lego.The location is in the middle of nowhere. They followed 'build it and they will come'. There is a small shopping mall consisting of restaurants which open from 9am to 9pm. There are a couple of convenience stores and that's it. Apartments and offices are being built and for some reason there is already a private hospital Gleneagles. The waterpark was better. Again smaller but of similar standard to that in California. We hired a Cabana for half day for RM180. This included wifi, fan, fridge, 5 drinks and 2 Legoland branded towels. 2 lounge chairs and 2 arm chairs. This is worth it as there is little room to sit and put your stuff. Most have simply sat at cafe / restaurant tables and chairs, which means for people who actually want to buy food and eat have nowhere to sit. You cannot book Cabana in advance. You can only book the full day option at start of day or the half day option at 2pm sharp. By 2:30pm most cabanas are gone.Legoland hotel is expensive. We have stayed in California for the novelty value but you can get a much better deal elsewhere. There are a few serviced apartments / hotels literally next to Legoland. They cost half the price and you get a 2 bedroom apartment with kitchen and laundry facilities.",4.0
780,"Malaysian trip, March 2018",A very long day as we took a bus from KL but so worth it.My children absolutely loved it.From the train rides to the Star Wars theme rooms and to the detail with the Lego pieces to also the historical relevance of many buildings in Lego form.Thank you.,4.0
781,Its all about the cute touches...,"My husband and Nephew are avid Lego fans and we spent two days in Legoland and enjoyed every moment. The highlight for hubby and my brother were getting their Lego driers licenses, my nephew loved the Ninjago ride ad we all enjoyed the 4D movies. There were some really cute touches like the song and dance the staff perform just before they open the park or the fact that you can ask the staff to swap with you to upgrade your mini-figurines. I found the trip from Singapore to Malaysia was quick and easy (less than 15 minutes through immigration). I think it's important that you choose the right time to get through immigration to avoid the long lines.",5.0
782,A long trip from Singapore,We took a bus tour with WTS Travel from Singapore to Legoland and I wouldn't recommend as immigration took a very long time. I hadn't factored in how long it would take in and out and it just wasn't worth it for us from a time perspective. I will say the kids enjoyed themselves but I honestly think you would be better off spending time at Sentosa as a lot of Legoland seemed to be under construction and a bit dated. Food options are limited and food from outside isn't permitted. Highlights were the virtual reality roller coaster ride and The Dragon. The other rides were fairly tame so I would mainly recommend for pre-schoolers.,3.0
783,Improves every every year,"The weather is the toughest obstacle to enjoyment - really hot, humid or sunny, followed by rain, and closing with humid evening. The trees however are still growing annually fortunately, and thank the management for finally installing more giant outdoor fans and ample activities with powerful air conditioning.  We also have expensive cold drinks to buy from well-positioned stalls. *hint hint*.  Why can‚Äôt we have some water fountains/coolers?Please continue improving. More ready grown trees plus during queues, please consider the sun‚Äôs positions.  There are some rides where customers queue directly in the sun for a Long time.  Staff quality has improved over the years, and I am delighted with this. Keep up the friendly faces!One more thing, food can definitely be improved on quality and pricing. Airports and theme Parks are the only 2 places I know where food quality do not correlate with prices. And Legoland does not disappoint. It‚Äôs expensive.",4.0
784,Very bad maintenance,I was impressed about how bad is this place in comparison to other legolands. This is supposed to be ran by the same chain. The restaurants are terrible and very unkept. At the stores they don't have fluent english and on top of that there is no free internet.,2.0
785,Great Treasure in Malaysia Value for Money ,I didn‚Äôt have much expectations going to Legoland.  Price was ok compared to Disney where in you have to queue for an hour per ride.  Malaysian crew were polite and courteous.  Rides were unique (well because I‚Äôm so used to Disneyland) my daughters loved the horse ride in the Kingdom Zone.The Waterpark section is a tad small compared to Singapores waterpark but all in all it‚Äôs a more controlled environment for my kids which is great.A must try if you haven‚Äôt experienced Legoland Park yet. Food is where it needs some work.  Compared to other theme parks Legoland is on the poor side on the food department. All in all great experience for me and my daughters.,4.0
786,Small but fun,"Legoland is two parks, a theme park and a water park. Both are quite small with only a handful of rides and they are aimed at younger children.Best ride is the VR racer which the kids loved....its a roller coaster with VR Headsets simulating a lego race....they went on it 6 times. There are a couple of other roller coasters, a log flume, a 4D Movie theatre and 2 blaster rides.Unlike other theme parks, Legoland also has an educational centre where children can learn to programme robotic lego (lasts about 30 minutes) and there is a Star Wars exhibition.there is an observation tower that provides views of the area and you can see the development work ongoing in the area.Finally there is a driving school, a boat school and a park train.The Water Park also has a small selection of fairly standard rides and a very tame wave pool.....its clear aimed at young children. Lazy river lets you build your own raft from floating lego bricks....great fun.Food in both parks is average and fairly expensive.Our childreb had a great time, but older children will find the rides quite tame.Lots of shops selling lego, but dont expect a discount...its lego and its expensive.",4.0

788,Our special son loves it here!,"Our 13 year old son loves it here! The fact that he has moderate autism, says it all as he is very selective in what he likes or doesn't. He does not like super adrenaline pumping  rides such as roller coasters but there are lots of other rides here at Legoland for him to enjoy.We also love the fact that there are playgrounds in the park which cater to both young children and not so young children (especially special ones like him). Lots of halal food choices(especially the types he likes; an important consideration for us too when we bring him out).We also love the huge fans at certain parts of the outdoor areas to keep us cool on hot sunny days. Overall, we enjoy ourselves during every visit. We recently purchased an annual pass although we are from Singapore. It's worth it!‚ò∫",5.0
789,Expedition VIP Tickets,"Paid for the 2 day combo for 2 nights at the Legoland Hotel (not partner hotel) with VIP Expedition tickets for the whole family (5 of us in total). We arrived around 1pm-ish, since check was at 4pm, decided to have lunch at next door building with 4 to 5 choices of eateries (we chose Secret Recipe). The rest of the afternoon was for the waterpark. Although VIP tickets did not include the waterpark, was not necessaary as queues were not too long and rides were worth the wait. Even had the opportunity to go on the more exciting rides twice (due to the short queue). By 4:30 pm, whole family was exhausted and decided to check-in. Sadly our room was not ready, but we were given a free upgrade, so not complaining. Had dinner at another eatery, but not as good as Secret Recipe, so somewhat disappointed.Next, day had an overwhelming breakfast, which was plentiful, both for choice and quantity. We were excited and got ready by 9:45am, meeting up with our VIP tour guide, Syawal. We were treated to first class treatment for all the exciting rides, even offered to go for a second time e.g. the virtual roller coaster ride. 1st time ever and was amazing. Other shooting rides was fun too. They had rides for all my 3 kids to enjoy (5yr, 9yr and 12yr old). Photo opportunity was available, although a bit pricey, so was selective on which rides I bought pictures. Lunch was included for about an hour. We began around 10am and were exhausted by about 3pm. We decided to retire early for the day although we had the option to go on the other rides using our VIP passes. Overall a worthwhile experience, staying at Legoland hotel for a minimum of 2 nights to thoroughly enjoy the whole park and 'Party in the Elevator'. My 5 yr old and 9 yr old enjoyed the music and lights. Kids enjoyed the lego bricks, all the rides and the rooms (with themes). Plan well, book early and bring enough cash. Could only find one ATM in the area. Grab car is pretty good in Johor Bahru, so worthwhile to get a local sim card (bought celcom sim card with good coverage). Afterthoughts? Might have preferred to rent out the cabana & gazebo (one of which is airconditioned). Each one is named and locations spread out in the water-park. Otherwise locker rentals are available. Seeing how I ended up renting 2 large lockers, the rental of the air-conditioned (cabana or gazebo, can't remember which one is air-conditioned) would have provided a private changing area to keep bags for a change of clothes. Afterwhich, you can go for a shower without having to rent the lockers.A strategic location of cabana or gazebo, would allow you closer access to the more exciting water park rides. Since we had lunch earlier, we did not need to buy any food at the nearby eateries. We had bottled water, to keep hydrated.Do remember to put on sun-block, as Johor Bahru can be quite hot and sunny.Would have earned full points, however reception staff appeared insufficient in terms of numbers. Also signage could be improved. Syawal (our VIP guide) is a credit to Legoland, as we were all tired by 3pm, he brought along our free gifts (5 legoland bags, with legoland themed water bottles etc.) to our room. Along with the pictures I paid for on certain rides.With proper budgeting and planning, Legoland is a fun and educational themed park for kids and parents alike. With ongoing improvements and new rides in the pipeline, we'll definitely be back for some more fun and excitement. Well done Legoland Management in Johor Bahru.",4.0
790,We had a great time,The kids loved it and I thought it was clean and safe. We have 2 sets of twins and the younger ones like to run off. I liked the fact there was only one way in and one way out of the parks. Was easier to keep an eye on the children. The older ones had great fun on the rides. Food was good at a reasonable price. ,4.0
791,Very good and nowhere close to completion,Amazing place for family with kids age 6 to 12! The place is compact easy to navigate and to our surprised might have been used to 50% of its capacity the very most!! Not sure if such is reasonable but we never lined up for anything! The rides are fun the mini lego display amazing' the shows entertaining' the food not too bad even price wise! The one thing I cannot understand!! WHY WOULD A LEGO SET BE 20 TO 40% MORE EXPENSIVE AT THE PARK THAN AT ANY MALL LOCATED IN JB! I do wonder how the area will look like in a few years time' construction is moving along all over the place! More restaurant will be much welcome and options for accommodation too! Exciting times for these parts of the world,4.0
792,Family Fun,"Fantastic day spent especially with younger children. Enjoyed our time there and spent the whole day at Legoland both the rides and water park. Lots of attractions for children and parents can also enjoy it with them. Love that it was not crowded and no long queues. We went there during Malaysia's non-school holiday. There are locker areas to keep safe your belongings, huge and clean shower and changing area.",4.0
793,A Day Trip from Singapore,"This theme park is an ideal day trip from Singapore and I think it's perfect for kids & family. However, if you are looking for exciting rides I wouldn't recommend this place for you. I love Lego and I am sure whoever likes Lego would love to visit Legoland too.",4.0
794,Lovely and calm amusement park,"Perfect for kids up to 8 years old. We have annual pass and has been there a few times now. It‚Äôs nice to get out of the Singapore weekend madness, hit the rides and top of the day with a visit to the great waterpark that is connected. If you want to stay for the night Puteri Harbour witha lot of nice eateries is close by.",4.0
795,"Small, a bit run-down park","Came with 3 kids on a weekday. Park was empty, many food stalls are closed due to the lack of crowd or closed early. Most rides have very minimal queue. Park is very suitable for people who like to take pictures, but the quality of the rides are limited and hard to see why people need to buy the annual pass. Can see the park is a bit run-down and need to be renovated or re-painted. The Robotics program is the most popular but space are very limited.The Waterpark is a bit better, with plenty of slides and activities.",3.0
796,Fantastic for the kids!,"Legoland Malaysia is an excellent day trip from Singapore, and a fantastic treat for the younger members of the family - for whom it is geared towards.  There are many children's activities and rides, as well as retail outlets for localised merchandise.  The food on offer is also excellent quality - and the restaurants are well air conditioned (which I guarantee you'll appreciate).  Many of the rides and attractions are suitable for adults as well - the roller coasters are pretty good - but without kids you'll run out of things to do by mid-afternoon.  Highly recommended if you're a family with kids - a little less so if you're more of the ""grown up"" kid.",4.0
797,2nd time,"Still the same place i seen last 2013 plus the water park was not yet finishedFor a day tour and your ticket is both the theme park and the water park, might has well plan the time because you will lost track of the time because you will enjoy them bothTheme park close at 6PM and if the weather is a bit cloudy with a chance of rain 20% of their rides will be closed (as per their staff)While on the Water Park, 100% will be closed if it‚Äôs raining. 90% of their slide we tried and it‚Äôs was fun especially that‚Äôs the first time i try almost all the slide in one water park.

799,Legoland Resort,"The resort comprises of the Theme and Water parks. The Water Park is really fantastic and worthwhile to visit especially for the kids. However, the sanitary for cleaning is not satisfactory and recommended to keep washing at your hotel lodge.  Theme park is just acceptable and the weather is considered too hot without too much sheltering places.  Hotel staying is fair but relatively is a bit expensive for its value.",3.0
800,Enjoyable trip!,"We bought the combo ticket & we not having enough time because both park had so much to offer. We having so much fun at both waterpark & theme park. For waterpark, floaters is available with no extra charges! As for theme park, they had 2 proper surau/prayer room at the entrance and also somewhere in the middle of the park. Food is quite expensive. Overall it was a good trip & staff also very helpful & friendly. Planning for our next visit :)",5.0
801,Second trip to Legoland since 2015!,"Our trip to Johor Bahru from March 17 to 20 was mainly to go to Legoland, thanks to their promotion whereby buying their 1-day ticket for MYR199.00 can get it converted to an Awesome Annual Pass - and we decided to buy one each for me, my wife, and elder son!And since this was our first trip back to Malaysia‚Äôs first international theme park in three years, what better way to enjoy the place than making TWO trips over the four days? Since it can get hard to cover everything in a day and just spread the visit over two instead!It was definitely great fun at this wonderful theme park and we enjoyed rides like the long and speedy Dragon rollercoaster, the scenic Observation Tower, the ‚ÄúBig Splash‚Äù water flume ride, and amazing puppetry during the Ninjago show, as well as the famous Miniland where LEGO replicas of renowned landmarks are at (notably the Petronas Towers, Port of Tanjung Pelepas, Johor Bahru Downtown, Clarke Quay in Singapore, the big mosque in Brunei, Angkor Wat, and Borobudur). As well as other goodies like the VR Coaster, LEGO Academy (huge place for kids to build their stuff), Driving School, and the popular Big Shop, which is also the largest such LEGO outlet in Malaysia and Singapore!With my personal favorite being LEGO Star Wars, including the beautiful models of the iconic Millennium Falcon, AT-AT, Darth Vader, and R2-D2, centering on six movies (the prequel and original trilogies) and The Clone Wars. Even if I‚Äôm curious as to why there is still nothing from the three latest movies - The Force Awakens, The Last Jedi, and Rogue One - as well as the recently concluded SW Rebels!",5.0
802,Fun and enjoyable stay at Legoland from 16 Mar to 18 Mar,"Did an early check 7am in on 16 Mar.  Paid extra RM300 for the early check in.  Kids enjoyed the Waterpark in the morning and the theme park in the afternoon.  The waterpark has many facilities.  My 3 year old enjoyed herself a lot in the water.  However, my 3 year old enjoyed lesser at the theme park as there are limited rides for her due to her height. My 3 other kids ranging from 6 years old to 12 years old enjoyed the rides a lot,especially for the Lego racer.  On the whole, the the stay was very fun and interesting.  The Kingdom suite room was big and spacious for 8.  The kids could play lego in the room.  The room faces the water park and theme park, which made the scenery from the room extremely beautiful.  We will likely come back again for more in the future.  However, we will try to go for a smaller room next time as the whole stay including the tickets to the park was very expensive.",4.0
803,Suitable for kids aged 6yrs and older or >100cm,"Great park for kids but Legoland staff are very professional and strict (which is a good thing!) and adhere to the minimum age AND (Not OR) height restrictions. So kids younger and don't like to eat vegetables to grow taller will miss out on most rides. Even the ""magic teacup"" equivalent ride that spins round and round does not allow younger kids to have a go...Hot, lack of shade and places to rest away from the heat. F&B choices are somewhat reasonably priced but still on the slightly higher side. Some outdoor lego exhibits are showing  signs of deterioration from the typical Asia weather. Start counter clockwise to avoid the main group flowing clockwise and skip the queues. The longest queue we did was for 15mins for the VR roller coaster ride which was a blast! Or maybe the park was just empty at ~20-30% capacity. Shows in AC environment is welcoming and  offers much relief from the heat. Could perhaps state showtimes on the park map so single entry guests could plan their time better. A little too much emphasis on promoting and selling lego themed models. Back to the basics with good old lego bricks is virtually non existent within the park and hotel (except for the free to play lego pits at the hotel but you can't buy those bricks). There should also be greater discount off the themed legos shouldn't it? After all, it's LEGOLAND. ",3.0

The best time to go there is not on the school holiday as the pack was really bad . Do not Buy from the Agent or  on9 as they will mark up usually , just go directly to the ticket counter there . Buy the season Pass for those who stay in Singapore and Johor  as the price almost same for the single entry , just add for some bucks .For school trips or any trips that involves with more than 30 peoples at a time , we can negotiate with the management directly for a lower fare .

All you need to do is get in line and hop in.Highly recommended for childrens and adults too.",4.0
815,Nice day out,I visited on a Tuesday and it was pretty quiet so there were no queues for any of the rides and I didn't feel rushed seeing things. There were some fantastic Lego creations of some of the places I've been. The StarWars exhibit was my personal favourite and the virtual roller-coaster was something else  (actual roller-coaster ride wearing Samsung Gear headset ).As I  went by myself 2.5 - 3hrs was plenty of time as I didn't go to the separate Waterpark next door. Also there is not much else around so I  ditched my prearranged bus ride & took the local yellow bus back to Jurong East in Singapore which cost 5 MYR which is a bargain. ,4.0

In 2017 the cabana includes 2 x legoland towels for free, and many bottled drinks!

820,Underwhelming and clearly unloved,"The staff were nice and smiley but the exhibits were tired and unexciting. It seems that nobody is really putting effort into caring for the place,  only in to ways to extract your money. Examples:--Fried Chicken restaurant had no fried chicken - not at the end of the day but at Lunchtime on a saturday !--Roller coaster broke down and riders had to be evacuated down emergency staircases.--the train broke down--The floor outside the changing rooms in the water park is, unbelievably, slippery when wet ! (other areas aren't - why not use that same surfacing everywhere ?--For a place where the weather alternates between broiling tropical sun and torrential tropical rain, there are very few covered walkways to be able to get from place to place--Even the drinking straws they give you are too short to reach the bottom of the bottle. Not one of life's biggest problems, but another indication of how the park feels like nobody cares or thinks about anything, big or small.However, when it comes to your money:--they will charge you eight pounds to use a locker--their burger bar will charge literally treble the price of the KFC in the Medini Mall a few yards away for an inferior product that also takes 3 times as long to arrive--They wont allow you to leave and re-enter the park on a day ticket, so they HAVE thought about something: how to ensure you have to buy their food at their prices and can't step out for lunch.",2.0

828,Good Fun but Avoid 4D Movies,"The weather was perfect. Dark clouds but no rain. The theme park was not crowded at all with hardly a queue for anything post the Chinese New Year holiday. We were here for almost 6 hours, riding almost every ride and viewing almost everything. There were good and shaded rest spots scattered around. We had lunch at Pizza Mania, the pizzas and chicken + Spanish rice were acceptably tasty. Just a few things we noted needs improvement. Being a park for kids, there are none or too few child height sinks in the eateries and only one in each bathroom. The 4D movie we watched, Chima or something like that, was very hard to follow and the dialogue was warbled. We were wondering about the wet (and sudsy) seats when walking into the theater but we soon discovered that the water effect drenches you so bring your rain coat! You first get wet and then there‚Äôs the wind effect to chill you further!! In general, the park needs better maintenance. Rails need painting, tiles and walls and etc need regular cleaning and repair. Broken or crooked LEGO structures have to be righted and cleaned too. Overall we had a good experience here but if you read this and decide to visit, avoid the 4D movies! ",4.0
829,Good for Kids!,"Kids will love this place. However, the heat can get to the children. The place is mostly suited for kids around 7-12 years old.

My 8 year old loves all things Lego, so he was in heaven. The rides are suitable for all age groups as many of them are not too thrilling. The few thrill rides they have are pretty tame. Even in February, it was so hot! Luckily there are lots of air conditioning to cook off in. The food was kind expensive, but freshly cooked. We exited the park and ate at the mall next door. The water park was also a great way too cool off, but it was really packed. Neither park is very large, so 2 days was plenty to ride everything once and our favorites a few times. I recommend boat school for all ages.",5.0
832,A place for all ages!,"There were a lot of people when we visited the theme park so its a good thing that we went there early. The park opens at 10am and the line maybe long but they move fast when the gates open. Furthermore, it is faster to get to Legoland at Johor Bahru, Malaysia if your coming from Singapore compared to coming from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.You are not allowed to bring any food or drinks inside. These will be confiscated during inspection. If you are a tourist, its better to get tickets online since you don't need to fall in line in the ticketing counter but straight to the entrance. Also, it is advisable to wear comfortable shoes/sandals since there will be surely a lot of walking. The theme park has a lot of rides for kids of different ages and those kid at heart. There just might be height requirements for some rides for safety purposes. For those who doesn't like to do rides, they can always opt to visit miniland which is at the center of the park for picture taking and watch live shows.Food offered in the part is quite cheap and is usually good for two (for a female appetite).

835,Fantastic Place for all!,Fantastic Place. Was very simmilar to Legoland London but alightly smaller. Getting the premium Pass was such a good deal. The staff are friendly and the place is clean. Kids loved it. Will definately be back to try the Legoland Hotel next time. ,5.0
836,Sunny and empty ,"Been there on day -1 and 1 of lunar new year. OMG, it was maybe at 20% occupancy. We had the time to go several times to some activities, and we did everything in one day. Second day at the water park were it was more crowded but still fantastic. We spent so much time in the lazy river and the water castle. ",5.0
837,Brilliant!!! Exceeded our expectations,"WOW!!! We had such a brilliant day at LegoLand!!! It was our little possums 5th Birthday and the Lego Team went above and beyond to ensure he had a great day. Also the food was AMAZING!!! not your traditional pre-made, mass produced fried food but delicious, freshly made food options with a large section of healthy food. We thought we could do both the theme park and water park in one day however you need 2 days at least!!!It was a quite day and we went on many of the rides several times. Cant wait to come back.",5.0
838,Good fun,"We went on the Saturday of cny and it was pretty full. Even though the line was long at the security check it moved along pretty fast. We had combo tickets and hero passes and decided to do legoland first (no security check at the water park). To get our hero pass bracelets we had to go to the visitors centre first. We were really glad we had the hero passes as it cut the wait at some rides by at least half an hour although it still took us half an hours wait for the vr ride. But that was definitely worth it and an absolute must if you go. We went twice. Otherwise it was a nice adventure park. The kids enjoyed it very much. After seeing everything (about 2 and a half hours, some rides were closed for maintenance üòØ) we went to the waterpark.  It was nice although we've been to better ones. The most fun was the river ride in which you could collect swimming bricks and try to build something. My 3 year old was too small for most of the rides though. Then we went to the park again and rose the vr ride again (again without my 3 year old). You can change between the parks as many times as you want as long as you don't lose your tickets. All in all a fun day but not cheap.",4.0

841,Perfect theme park for kids age 4-8,"We had a blast at Legoland! Park was clean and of manageable size which makes it enjoyable with young kids. We went 2 days before CNY (the day before Malaysia public holiday starts) and we‚Äôre surprised to find the park to have short queues. We were able to get on all the rides we want 2-3 times. Favourites were Ninjago, Great Lego race (VR roller coaster), and lost kingdom. Start from the furthest rides from entrance to beat the crowds. We did driving and boating schools last and only had to wait 10min or so. Only disappointment was Lego express which was very slow and sleepy.Watch the heat. A lot of shelters and indoor places like Build and Test. Plan your visit before you go. We were able to do water park on the same day in the hot afternoon which is great.No outside food in the park. Mostly fast food available but lots of choices at Medini Mall right outside the entrance. Note that no re-entry is allowed if you don‚Äôt hold a combo ticket (water + theme park). ",5.0

845,Better than Universal Studio!,"Useful tips that will save you time and money.First, it can get bit pricey to get there we used WTC Tour and cost us $24 return per person from Singapore Flyer.Second, pick a day in a week to go there (Mon-Thrs) as they are not busy at those days and you will not queue for rides. Third, you don't need to change your money from Singapore SGD to Malaysian RM as they accept SGD in most places and if not they'll take your credit card. Note, that small vendors outside do not accept Singapore dollars or Credit Cards only RM.And last if you are wandering to take both wet and dry Legoland entry in one day DON'T because it took us whole day just to do the rides in dry park.Hope my tips will save you some money and make you stay pleasant.",5.0
846,Place to have fun,"Place is nicely decorated for the upcoming CNY celebrations. Price is kinda steep even for me (MyKad holders get 25%). For local visitors, if you have Maybankard they offer 30% discount which is even better. I went on a weekday (Monday) and it wasn't packed at all. No queues at all anywhere. Sat the rides right away or perhaps after 1 round of waiting. Of course the Lego decorations that were outside looks a bit dusty and worn out (from the rain and shine) but still alright. There were fun rides for adults too such as the VR roller coaster and The Dragon roller coaster. Though not as crazy as other amusement parks but it was pretty good and since there wasn't any line, you're more than welcome to go on it as many times as you like. Staffs were really friendly and cheerful, they greeted visitors and gave funny and fun announcements before and after some of the rides. Lots of rides suitable for kids of course but plenty of photo opportunities for the adults as you reminiscence going back to your childhood days when you play Lego. They also have 4D shows at different timing and the Ninjago Live Show which is worth going for. Some rides are interactive and pretty fun to play like the Ninjago and Mummy rides. Prices for food and drinks are quite expensive. I spent around 4 hours there skipping the kiddy rides but I waited for the Ninjago live show which was the last thing I did before leaving.",4.0
847,Fun Place To Visit,"We had lots of fun spending the day in Legoland. Food in Legoland was expensive as any other theme park standard, but the quality is great. We really enjoyed the food.

Worth a trip for sure.,3.0
856,Kids loved it!,"We brought my son, 6yrs old and niece, 7yrs old.Theme Park We went on a monday. They enjoyed our visit as almost all the rides are child friendly. We manage to cover all of it in a day and made multiple rides on some of the attractions. The park staff are very friendly, if there‚Äôs no queue they will allow you to ride again without re-queuing. They can obtain their drivers license for RM25 at the driving school which they really enjoyed and I think is also popular among kids. The theme park was not crowded during our visit. It was raining when we arrived luckily it stopped until it‚Äôs was time to go home. Be ready with ponchos just in case and it‚Äôs good to check the weather before your visit. We didn‚Äôt really check on the merchandise so much but the make your own minifigures are cheaper compared to Singapore but the bigger sets are almost about the same. The food inside are reasonably priced for a theme park. Our lunch cost me RM100-150 for 5 person at the Pizza Mania.TIP: Bring insect repellent as there are a lot of mosquitoes.Theme / Water park are open from 10am to 6pmWater ParkWe loved the slides but it was really too tiring to carry the floaters all the way up. There is this slide which only has 2 big floaters in rotation. So the waiting time is very long. We opted to ride the red slide as you do not need to carry the floater but it was a little too easy. We hoped the wave pool will have stronger waves. ",4.0
857,Loved it!,"We went there last Wednesday (Jan 25). It was very convenient because no crowd. Queues were quite short. We loved each & every ride very much.My boys (age 7 & 6) smiled ear-to-ear the whole day. Even Grandma (73) enjoyed the well maintained park from the wheelchair we rented for 50 ringgit (plus 50 ringgit for deposit, which we retrieved after using it).The only downside was some restaurants (in the dry park) were closed üò≠ (The Asian Deli, pizza restaurant). When we finally reached one of the restaurants, which was Burger Junction, starving people were piled up so we had to wait quite long for our food (30 minutes +). Luckily, the burgers were awesome (or maybe it was just because we were very hungry). The fried chicken & french fries were just OK. The salad was great. The drinks were huge. Although the prices were expensive, since we are Asians with little tummies, we didn't mind about it because we shared one portion for 2-3 people.We also went to the water park the next day. We had soooo much fun. For lunch, we ordered honey baked chicken rice & it was sooo yummy! My son & I loved it very much. At the changing room, the locker machine was very fascinating for us (LOL). But sadly, the Joaker Soaker was under maintenance.Some tips from us: 1. If u find something u really like at one of the stores, don't hesitate & buy it. My sons are huge fans of Nexo Knights, we bought some of the toys at the King's Market, which were not available at any store in our home country (Indonesia), nor at another stores inside Legoland. If we hadn't, I wouldn't want to go back all the way to King's Market üòÖ (it's a verrrry loooong way).2. If u are interested in going to the water park as well, do it on separate days. Based on the recommendation given by TripAdvisor members, we went to the water park the next day and we were so glad we did it.3. If u go there in the morning & looking for breakfast, there are some convenient stores & a Subway restaurant at Mall of Medini (in front of Legoland) opens at 8 am. ",5.0
858,Our Children Loved it !,"We prebooked a 2 day ticket online, just in case it was too busy to get in.  We live in New Zealand and did not want to turn up and be refused entry.  On reflection, this would have been unlikely !We bought a ticket for the main park and for the adjacent and separate Lego waterpark.  The family enjoyed this too.We chose to stay in Johor Bahru and simply get  taxi there and back, rather than stay in the relatively expensive Lego hotel.",5.0

Bought the ticket in klook and booked the transfer from sg to legalond also from klook.. Its amazing that the  stuff displayed here are all made up of legos.. Its really amazing.! ,5.0
862,They had LEGO shaped FRIES! ,From my experiences I think Legoland is better for little kind in the primary and middle school age then it is for teenagers and older people. There was only one ride that teenagers would‚Äôve found thrilling which is the virtual reality roller coaster (it was actually amazing!!) and the jungle one with a boat that goes down a water slide (I forgot it‚Äôs name sorry). The roller coasters and rides were slow and I think they were meant to cater for that smaller age as opposed to teenagers. My little sister (6) loved Legoland because she was able to go on most of the rides as opposed to universal studios (which we had been to 2 days ago) she wasn‚Äôt able to ride that much. But Legoland isn‚Äôt just about the rides there‚Äôs a lot more to it. There are some rides that adults can go on with their children and while they aren‚Äôt thrilling as such they‚Äôre just fun to do with family. There‚Äôs:-a train that goes around some of Legoland - a LEGO water boat for two people - the fantasy cave where you shoot the red dot - fire rescue And I can‚Äôt think of anymore on top of my head but they were actually quite fun. I would actually recommend getting fries since they were LEGO shaped!!! Even as a 17 year old find that really cool and amazing!!! There was also this show which was quite cool and it was like puppetry (I think it was based off the ninjago series) but the puppetry was so realistic and even my parents were as intrigued and excited as the little kids during the show. And if you like photography remember to bring your camera since in the middle they have a lot of monuments from Asia made by Legos and it was honestly so cool!!! I don‚Äôt have a lot of photos on my phone since I took my camera but I shared the generic ones I do have on my phone here. I think Legoland is like a good family bonding experience and two things which my family loved compared to universal studios is that the lines were really short and the park wasn‚Äôt the size of an Olympic swimming pool so it was easier to see all of it. ,5.0
863,2nd visit,We came better prepared this time and got to enjoy more rides than our first visit :)Hotel provided shuttle less than 15 mins ride away so were literally there at 10am opening times.It was outside of Malaysia/ Singapore school holidays so we had no long quesPlease bring your own raincoats or ponchos although these are available at gift stores.,5.0
864,So Much Fun,"Booked 2 days at Legoland Resort & Theme Park, travelling in from Singapore. Have heard others had lengthy delays at the border but this wasn't our experience, the whole trip took an hour. The hotel is fantastic for the kids, we stayed in an Adventure theme room & the kids loved having a treasure hunt to do as soon as we got there to unlock some Lego treasure while we got settled. We spent the first day at the water park as it was overcast & stormy - good thing too as it rained heavily most of the day which was perfect for the slides, no lines! There was a good range of pools & rides to suit all ages. Second day at the theme park was amazing as well, so many things to do, rides, driving school, make your own Lego character etc etc. The VR roller coaster had just opened on our arrival so perfect timing. Quite a long wait but very much worth it!Food at the hotel was very expensive but captive audience I guess. The Japanese restaurant was lovely, the buffet a bit of a madhouse & a bit lacking in good hot food. Overall a fantastic experience, the kids were over the moon, so glad we sprung for this trip.

865,Kids Favourite!,"Our second visit and this time is even better as during low season. We enjoyed all ride with minimum queue. Water Park is Excellent, unfortunately 3 slides were closed due to regular maintenance. Staff at both theme & water park are very friendly. :)",5.0
866,Totally under-rated!,"We did the one day trip from Singapore to Malaysia to visit Johor Bahru's Legoland Malaysia.We were truly impressed. But we did learn a few things. We didn't realise until entry that our travel agent had booked tickets to Legoland Malaysia Water Park as opposed to to Legoland Malaysia Theme Park. The two are different. Fortunately the staff were accommodating and allowed us to pay to upgrade to the 'theme park' which is the main attraction.In hindsight we will go back again, but book overnight accommodation at either the colourfully-decorated Legoland Resort in order to spend two thorough days at the theme park. There were rides for all ages, queues weren't too bad, excellent lego theme and statues throughout the park.There was also delicious food. There seemed to be renovations taking place at the front and the water park attractions were mostly closed due to maintenance.Our children thoroughly enjoyed Legoland and will definately return. This was complimented by the friendly Malay staff. I recommend dressing modestly here and anywhere in Malaysia in respect of the majority Muslim population.Definately give yourself a whole day or a bit more. The park was quite different from any other theme park I've seen.",5.0

869,Good for older kids but mind the peak period,"Visiting during the school holidays in December would have always been a challenge and we accept that but the queues seems worst off than the other Eastern Asian theme parks we visited.Nevertheless, our family did have a good time there. Be sure to check for the height requirements before going to the rides to avoid disappointing the kids as the staff are strict (rightfully so) about the height requirement.",4.0
870,First Time to Legoland,"This is our first time to visit Legoland. Actually, Legoland is not in our itinerary, but, because we haven't go here, so we decided to go there. First, we get information how to get to Legoland from Singapore. There is several alternative, by bus, rent a taxi. Because not all Singapore taxi can get through the immigration of Malaysia. Because we don't want spending a lot of time on the street, so we rent a taxi. Because it only takes 1 and 1/2 hour than by bus we have to spend almost 3 hours on the street. We arrived at Legoland almost 10.30, and the weather is good. Not too hot. After rent a locker, we take a train to go around Legoland. We just go to the Theme Park not to the Water Park. The entrance is still under renovation. Actually, is not too big Theme Park and several attraction is closed for renovation. I already go to Legoland in Denmark. And in Malaysia is quite smaller than in Denmark. But, we have a good time there.",4.0

The best ride he enjoys is the Ninjago ride.He will insist on going for at least 2 rides minimum!. Excellent theme park to bring your kids. Very friendly and helpful staffs.",5.0
872,2nd visit ,"Upon arrival, entrance was partially partitioned with heavy construction going on. New attraction coming soon (which really needed). The park was less crowd compare to a year ago. New VR Roller Coaster available queueing system need to be more systematic. Notices of minimum age or height should be in clearer signage...after 40mins long queue only realised the restrictions! Overall, Legoland management need to look at revamping the most of the attractions. Especially the miniature cities of the world in the centre of the park...it really looks terrible and not a good sight to look at at all!! We want to support every year but it has to be worth it. ",3.0
873,Legoland,"I have been there but its only one time.  I do not actually enjoyed it because I do not go for many of the rides. It's more for the children and teenagers.  The place is very hot, not much shade and the shops are not many. Food is roughly more expensive than in JB city.  ",3.0
874,Theme Park & Water Park,"First day (of 2) we visited the Legoland theme park. Overall impression: it‚Äôs very dated, in need of a face-lift & refresh and from a ‚Äúfun‚Äù perspective, Very passive. A major disappointment for our youngest (5 1/2) particularly, was being excluded from rides because she was ‚Äútoo young‚Äù -this despite her comfortably reaching and exceeding the minimum height restrictions posted for the rides. Nowhere within the park is there any suggestion of minimum ages for participants. The next day we dedicated to the Water Park. I have personally never experienced anything quite like this place. Several of the more featured rides were unavailable due maintenance. ALL the other rides apparently had ‚Äúrules‚Äù that were posted nowhere, enforced by sheeple without ability to think for themselves. I‚Äôve never seen anything quite as variably restrictive- apparently on whim -as this place. Again our youngest was refused participation based on her age. At other times we were refused participation due the fabric of a t-shirt worn (!!!) and most frustratingly on some rides my (tethered to my wrist!) GoPro was not a problem whilst on others I was not allowed even to carry it in my shorts pocket, with the ride being held-up until I surrendered it!!! At other times, my wrist-watch (a small G-Shock) was the problem, again having to be surrendered to park staff. The ‚Äúrules‚Äù imposed seem to be in-step more with commercial demands from site sponsors than any practicality, Safety and/or health realities- or common sense... a commodity which is clearly lacking in this facility. Like most parents, I wish to record my family enjoying themselves. A small GoPro poses no risk to my family, myself or others. It does mean that I will NOT purchase any exorbitantly priced photos from the dozens of corporate-sponsored photographers on-site though, which is the most likely reason for the restrictive behaviour of staff. Interestingly, smart phones of any size in protective plastic envelopes on a loose lanyard worn around the neck were visibly in-use everywhere, apparently without restrictions. My thoughts: stay away. Overpriced, unnecessarily restrictive, old, dated, poorly maintained- and frankly, boring. The kids had a Lot more fun in the adjacent Legoland Hotel, with endless entertainment there for them included in the room rate. ",2.0
875,Park was empty - experience was AMAZING,"Seriously our best day in Malaysia, we look a 6am flight from KL to JB and an uber to the park, it was a long day, but because the park was so quiet (It was a Tuesday) we managed to fit in every single ride!  Had a fib a little about my daughters age - despite meeting the height requirement the minimum age was 6 on most rides - Staff were all so friendly, VR ride was absolutely phenomenal.  Had a combo pass to both water park and the main park.  Highly recommend it.  My only regret was the night flight home, wish we would've stayed at the hotel instead",5.0
876,Legoland themepark is so fun,"Finally we arrived at Legoland themepark Malaysia. The children have been very impatient to play on this ride since the day before. The weather of the day was quite windy and a little hot. We rented a double stroller like at the time at universal studio last year.And i only know when we enter that we actually get combo tickets to legoland waterpark also * sigh * unfortunately we did not prepare time for swimming so we just enjoy themepark only that day.This park is very interesting and very large so that not all the rides we can ride, there is a train that can be climbed to surround the lego themepark.Among all the toys available, the children most like to play the Lego ride ninjago the ride, because that day is not too crowded, we ride the ride up to three times.Inside legoland quite a lot of playgrounds are available outside the rides and it is the concentration of children split because they also really enjoy playing in the existing playground.First enter the lego area, we are treated to a miniature place in the world and made of lego. All look amazing, children getting bored quickly because they want to go to the play area.We visited starwars miniland, all parts packed very well here. And then still many other games that are quite interesting for them like, city airport, resque academy, junior driving school, boating school, lego kingdom, observation tower and much more.Actually this themepark is very fun, but because it is wide and our time is limited, so there are still many toys that we can not ride.Places to eat are pretty much available in here, so no need to be afraid to feel hungry and thirsty, and souvenirs can be purchased here.We really enjoy our holiday at legoland, and we seem to be coming back here again. With a longer time",5.0
877,Legos for Kids,"The park provides a very nice experience for Kids especially though rides are still abit limited on rides. Very good in terms of safety of kids,  they provide relatively good water vests for the rides that would require kids to wear one. Shops also provide good range of lego items and playsets",4.0
878,Great for young kids,"Had lots of fun with the kids here. It was raining, but this did not stop us. Going in the low season meant no queues for almost everything.",5.0
879,Kids had so much fun!,"We went on a day that the weather wasn't fantastic and it was after school holidays so there were no queues at all - we could go on rides multiple times without needing to get off.The kids had a great time and there were enough rides and enough variety. As mentioned in other reviews, some rides they needed to be 6 and a certain height and although our child was the height, they are only 5 so couldn't go on the ride. Not a big deal though as there were plenty of other rides that they could go on. Just a warning - if you go on the boat ride you will get totally drenched (can't remember the name of the ride) Eating - There are a number of places to eat and the gift shop is great - lots of variety of Lego but a little more expensive than Australian prices. I particularly loved the lunch box you could buy and get a name engraved on it - haven't seen anywhere else I can get that.Bathrooms - The bathrooms were clean and you could find them everywhere. Tickets - I was a little confused as I tried to buy online and it said sold out but that just meant you needed to buy tickets at the door (or from the tour company like we did). Travel - We stayed in Sentosa and they recommend up to 2 hours to get there (including getting through immigration). We were lucky that day and there was no traffic at all going there so it took us about 45-50 mins (we left at 10am from hotel). On the way back at 6pm, there was only about a 15 minute wait at immigration.Water World - The kids also loved Water World and again as it was so quiet it was easy to keep an eye on the kids as they went to different activities. I would recommend taking the kids to Legoland and you would need many hours there if not the whole day.",5.0
880,I think ONLY kids aged 3-10 will enjoy this park,"It' s a mini version of disneyland ( I guess). The rides are cute,as well as the area but maybe not that good enough for those who have already experienced ""Universal Studios-kind of thrill rides"" :) Recommended for kids ;) ",3.0
881,Water park day with the kids,"I booked the tickets for the water park online and had a good deal. Arrived at the park at 10am as we took the free shuttle from Somerset Puteri Harbour. The rides were adequate and had rides and games to suit different ages. When you are all tired, you can lounge at the chairs provided at the  wave pool area. The only thing was that people were selfish and used the chairs to put their belongings without being there. I can say that 80% of the time they were just belongings on the chairs and lounges. The food available are the usual food that you would find the theme parks but  with Lego theme of course.Overall experience was good and the kids totally enjoyed it ",5.0
882,Great for Little kids. ,"This place is great for the younger family members and a good way to introduce kids to a theme park where they are able to do most, if not all of the rides. Older kids may find it a bit tame. Our 11 year old was at the upper end of the age groups that would find this place fun especially if you have done more exciting theme parks. There was maintenance being done on 1 of the more exciting rides when we were there and as it was raining they didn‚Äôt allow you to use the VR head sets on the race ride. Without the VR it is just a small roller coaster. Having said that we still had a great day and highlights were the mindstorm robotics, ninjago, pharaohs revenge and the Star Wars miniland. ",4.0

Due to traffic jam and a long queue at the immigrations , we reached Legoland very late so that we only have few hours to play there. I suggest for those who want to play all the attractions and enjoyed the Legoland area, it is better to spend a night at Johor Bahru instead of having a round trip Singapore - Johor Bahru.",5.0
885,We love the water park,"We visited both of their parks. They have some intereating activities in this theme park  like learn to drive school, lego city aiport, lego mindstorms where a creative workshop for building and experimenting with robots. It was a good exposure for my child for the first time about how a robot works.  For a day trip, we have not experience all their activities and rides. There are too many to cover in one day. ",3.0
886,Awesome fun,"The park opens at around 10 ish and we were there right at that time. We had booked tickets online. Preferably with doing both the water park and theme park will take 1.5 days, but if you take VIP pass on a weekday and you are stretched for time, you do both together in one day.  The rides are fun, my five year enjoyed the maximum and she went on all rides.  The lego mini land was awesome. And do buy Legos at the store as no where else will you Legos at those prices ",5.0
887,Good place for kids,"I like the park so much, not so many people and no need to line up and wait for long time. Water park is also fun but my son get red eyes after it. Also the restaurants are cheap and there are some restaurants outside as well. The hotel is great as well.",5.0
888,Awesome,"Wonderful theme park for all Lego fans. the Ninjago area is the best designed. the 4D ride is very good too.. The rides are good, cater for all from kids to adults. Pls be aware of the weather as it is mostly outdoor. Such a shame it is not very well maintained. Need to do paint jobs on the rides and Lego Statues. Will probably visit again just because it's Lego. üòÑ",4.0
889,Third time to visit & pleased with new attractions,"It's my 3rd time to visit Legoland and I'm quite pleased to see added attractions such as the Star Wars mini-movie with the incredible Lego installations of memorable SW scenes and characters, VR roller coaster and the Duplo express and the adjacent playground which our toddler and his friend enjoyed immensely. Since we visited around Christmas break, there was also a Christmas mini-show featuring characters like the policeman and Santa Claus which had the children either in stitches, if they're not singing or dancing along.",4.0
890,Great fun for the whole family,"We recently did the Legoland VIP experience. We had a great breakfast on arrival. Made of own LEGO minis which were later put into the LEGO display. We chose to put ours near the mer lion in Singapore. You have a staff member take you where you want to go. You literally jump to the head of the queue. We could go on rides as many times as we wanted. You felt like a real VIP. When it got to lunch we had a reserved table, we ordered lunch from a menu, no queues, it was brought to us. All a bit surreal. This is all included too. I would recommend it is you are light on for time and you want to do it all. Numbers were lower the day we went so we could have done it without. But it just made it a lot less stressful. Also our staff member was great with the kids so they had another person to say can we do this to. And the answer was always yes",5.0
891,Excellent Theme Park,"It was my first visit to a Legoland ever and basically I love it! The price maybe quite expensive but with Waterparks and main Legoland theme parks, it was one of the best experience ever (despite some of the water flumes and rides were closed due to maintenance). It's even better when it was not a school holiday! I am guessing during school holiday you will have to queue quite a long one! Gotta love Waterparks, the rides (including virtual reality ride), 4D cinematic experience, Miniland (featuring buildings from some of the great cities of Asia) and Star Wars to name but a few",5.0
892,Legendary trip,"I write this review paining to go back again very soon! Legoland caters for everyone. My boys aged 9, 6 and 4 equally had a time of their lives at the theme park. We wished we had more time to explore more of the park, however, our 4 hours were jammed with roller coaster rides, site seeing, interactive play and all round entertainment. There were bathrooms and Salaat facilities on almost every corner of the park with baby/parent rooms. The staff are cheerful and helpful.Although the food on offer was delicious, we found it quite expensive as compared to rest of malaysia. Also, water fountains are not common in the park, therefore budget for alot of bottled water. ",5.0
893,More improvement need to be done!,We were back to LEGOLAND Malaysia again! Last visit there was in March 2017. This was our N times here and we were back for the new VR ride. It was less scary to have the VR on for the ride while the volume on the background music was too soft. Quality of the VR visual was good and sharp. Still prefer the normal ride without VR which one can opt not to put on.More can be done to the park as this is the rainy season hence there would be lots of mosquitoes in the park. We were bitten by mosquitoes while queuing for ride. The Pizza restaurant was without physical menu while one can only see what they have on the 2 iPads available at the cashier when you order. Waste of time queuing as one will need to think and decide what they want to order. Should have big sign board on the menu or the normal ones for customers to see in advance before ordering.The so-called photographer in the park should be able to take a nice decent photo for the park goers...we asked one of them to take one with the Santa Claus and sleigh for our family and it turned out none of the taken ones are of normal standard...The entrance signature sign board was gone so one cannot take picture as it was undergoing upgrading for the new Sea Life.Good promotion scheme on the annual pass which we did upgrade for one. Good value promo for the customize minifigures at a very attractive prices of 6 @ only RM36. Sorry that I've forgotten to take a picture on that...we wil be back soon!,3.0
894,Great for kids of all ages ... even the adult kids.,"We absolutely love Legoland, in fact we went as far as to buy annual passes this year and will probably renew next year as well. One of the nice aspects is you can visit the park in the day when the weather is not quite so hot and the migrate to the water park in the afternoon to cool down.",5.0
895,Never Staying There Again,"This was our 2nd time staying at legoland hotel. The first time we stayed was the previous year in Jan 2017. For SGD400 a night on a weekend it definitely wasnt worth it.- During check in the counter staff told us that the kingdom themed room was apparently all booked. Seriously? But why did the online system state that the kingdom room was still available upon booking confirmation? Which means the online system cant be trusted?? As 'compensation' they offered us a 'premium' adventure room which was exactly the same theme that we had the previous year. However to b fair, the lady at counter was nice with us though.- The rooms were not very well maintained. There were ants on the table but wat we really cant accept was there were ants on the bed! Luckily we checked before we use the bed. Also the soap dispenser kept getting dislodged and the carpet itself felt dirty amongst other things.- Worse part was at breakfast a male staff directed us to a seat which were the hard benches. Along the way we spotted another table with proper chairs which we told him we wanted that type of table as we had 2 toddlers and my mom in law. Along came another female staff stopped us in a rude manner ""i brought another family here"". My qn was why in the first place didnt the male staff bring us to the proper tables in the first place which was actually available at tt point of time?? And does that female staff need to be so rude?Overall the whole experience of staying there is not really worth the amount of money we paid for. Our kids love the whole lego theme but after this latest stay sorry no more we will be better off spending our money elsewhere. A really bad experience.",2.0
896,perfect family park for kids under 12,"With 2 kids (7 and 9) we had a perfect day in this lovely park. Do not compare this park with Disney or other big parks since this park is 100% kids friendly and therefore the walking distances in the park are limited. There is a nice variety of rides and things to do. The new VR rollercoaster is truly amazing and world class. The longest line we had was 10 minutes (Saturday) so we could do all attraction easily within one day, in our case there was no need of the fast pass option. We loved Miniland with a lot of Asian Sights rebuilt. The only thing was the that there were no healthy food options.",4.0
897,Family Trip ,"Suitable for family trip, have dry park and water park to choose, or play at both park. Attraction, fun and enjoy. ",4.0
898,Great theme park for kids,"We had high expectations towards this amusement park since the admission price were quite high. It turned out to be great, especially for the kids in our family, aged 5 and 7.The area is large and there are plenty of rides to choose from. Even our youngest were permitted to ride Virtual Reality roller coaster, and had a blast! The kids enjoyed the Lego structures scattered  all over the area. There are buildings, statues, etc. Even us adults enjoyed taking pictures and exploring the beautifully designed areas. Please take note that all food and drinks sold inside Legoland are crazy expensive. We had lunch at Market Restaurant and had to pay 34 MYR for a set menu of nasi ayam, a bottled drink, and a cup of pudding for dessertNevertheless, it was a fun experience for our family. Everyone should go there at least once",4.0
899,Great for kids,"We stayed here while visiting the parks over two days.  It‚Äôs heaps of fun for the kids from the lego play area to the fun themed rooms.  I particularly liked the lifts.  I wouldn‚Äôt come here if it wasn‚Äôt to bring kids, it‚Äôs not a place for adults.  When I had a shower the drain was blocked and water flooded the bathroom, we pulled out the 3rd bed and there were stains on the sheets, the cover on the main bed was also dirty.  The shower head was loose and would not stay up.  The housekeeping needs to be more thorough but they were quick to rectify the issues.  The rooms are starting to get run down with mould stained grout and curtains starting to fray.  I wouldn‚Äôt hurry back but the kids enjoyed it.",3.0
900,Legoland Malaysia; a short visit,"Prior to the visit I was always skeptical about Legoland as a place of attraction; I was not into Lego. As we arrived just before the opening hour the queue for the ticket was quite long. But what a delightful place, my family thoroughly enjoy themselves. The miniature, which display buildings from Malaysia as well as ASEAN is a different than what we had seen at other places before. The lively display is makes it very interesting. We also like the Stars War display. Due to the short visit we did not go the the water park.",4.0
901,Great Value,We got a two day combo ticket and it was worth it. Allowed us to rest in the middle of the day during the heat.The park was very quiet we didn‚Äôt have to line up for anything and it sometimes felt like we were the only ones there.There are not a lot of thrill rides and my 10yo was ageing out of a few attractions. However the rollercoasters were his favourite. Photos at the big attractions are about MYR60 but we got two photos. Staff exchange lego mini figures so take your doubles with you. We didn‚Äôt eat in the park instead eating at the mall just outside which was cheaper. Warning: Dino Island is probably the wettest flume ride I‚Äôve ever been on.The Waterpark was undergoing renovations while we were there so we didn‚Äôt get to use the lazy river or any of the Duplo area. It was also a little confusing getting in. The wave pool is huge and the waves are very gentle. They also played Ninjago episodes and other entertainment on. Big screen above it. Wear sunscreen - there is very little shade.Slides all suitable for young ones and old ones alike. ,4.0
902,high expectations....,"Maybe we had high expectations about LGL Malaysia. Nothing special about it, not a single ride that will stay engraved in your memory. Worth visiting however,if you happen to be in the area and have children with you.",3.0
903,"My kids love it, great for young and old","This is my family's 3rd visit to Legoland and we upgraded to annual pass on our recent visit. There was an online promotion during the last week (or last few days) of December where the premium pass (same price for all ages, for 2 parks) was only RM362 each. Unfortunately, we missed the promotion. We bought 2-day pass online (RM319 for adult, RM249 for kids/seniors) and paid RM125/pax to upgrade to premium pass. If you visit Legoland for more than 2 days a year, you may want to keep an eye for promotions online.Legoland is great for families as there are quite a number of activities suitable for the young and old. For teenagers and young adults, 1 day is sufficient as there are not much super exciting rides. For families with young kids and elderly, 2-3 days is a better pace, as there is less need to rush around.We visited the park on a Friday and Saturday in December. If you have a number of rides you are interested to go for, do be there when the park opens. Otherwise, come after 1pm and the crowd starts to thin at most rides.My younger girl could not meet the height requirement of 100-110 cm hence she could not play 'Aquazone Wave Racers' and 'Pharaoh's Revenge' (log ride). Kids will be able to play most rides when they are at least 6-7 years old.Activities suitable for young and old includes: 'Boating School' (long waiting time but our parents enjoyed steering the boat too), 'Legoland Express' (train ride), 'Ninjago' (4D ride), Observation Tower and the various shows.Kids favourite: 'Royal Joust', 'Dragon Apprentice', 'Driving School' (6 y.o. onwards), 'Junior Driving School' (5 and below), 'Lost Kingdom Adventure' (shooting game), 'Build &  Test' (build tower and racing cars with LEGO pieces, it's indoor, great for wet weather programme)Remember to bring a change of clothes if you intend to play 'Pharaoh's Revenge' (log ride). It is pretty addictive. You will definitely get wet. Even if you wear the poncho, you might get a little wet as water may seep in at the openings. Do bring umbrella too. It rained pretty heavily in the evening during our trip. There is no shelter between Medini Mall/the hotel and Legoland.Food wise, the variety is alright. Although Legoland doesn't allow you to bring food in, fruits is alright. We had bread and apple slices in our bag. The security guard told us bread is not allowed, but apple is ok.Each eatery sells different food items. There are pizzas, nasi lemak, burger, fries & sausage. I had the ice-cream waffle at 'Kingdom' (near the dragon ride) last year around 2pm and it's very nice. The ice-cream is ordinary but the waffle is crispy. Didn't manage to have it this year as the shop was sold out on popcorn and waffle by 4-5pm. If you want to have dinner, there are more variety over at Medini Mall (right outside Legoland) but do go there early as most of the restaurants would have queues closer to Legoland's closing time. Accommodation wise, these are the only ones within close distance at the moment (don't need to drive): Legoland Hotel, Somerset Medini (serviced apartments) and Afiniti Residensi (airbnb). Oh yes, if you bought tickets online, remember to print them out and bring your ID card too (must match name on the e-ticket). The staff will ask for them.",4.0
904,VIP tour,"Booked this tour for hubby and 7yo boy. They were greeted in the lobby at 9am and taken to breakfast. At 10am they were the first to enter the theme park with the VIP host. This access gave priority access to the rides. Also included was a lunch which was fairly average. The host was lovely her name was Hannan (I think). At the end of the tour the were given a Lego backpack, drink bottle, Lego and a special brick. The VIP tour includes a lanyard with their names. Legoland was great for small kids, the rides are well suited. You would probably want to take kids around 4yo upwards to go on most the rides. 7yo and up they can go on every ride. We found this place quite affordable. It was so much fun building 16 minifigure in a display box for $50aud. We also got keyrings and Lego boxes engraved at a reasonable price. Highly recommend a visit! ",4.0
905,Lego Land Hotel - Old,The overall experience was great with the theme park and water park. But the hotel is old. The rooms and washroom also looks and feels very old and shabby. Slightly bigger washroom would be nice.,5.0
906,Not worth the time and money,"We just visited for two days and this was such a disappointing experience!!! Like another reviewer mentioned most of the rides were shut down due to some repair works being done and no explanation as to why? We even got stuck in one of the rides( the observation tower) . Had to wait for a technician to come and fix the problem for it to bring us all back down.The park is old, small and maintenance appears to be nonexistent. Also very few staff members available just to ask questions. The ones that were there looked bored and tired... and the park had just opened.Restaurants inside the park close on a Monday??? Really ridiculous!!! If the park is open so should all the kiosks, rides and restaurants. The rest of the food in the park also unappetising. The shops had nothing different than what I would normally find in the shopping centres. The park lacks attractiveness and that spark that tells you this is a special place. Besides the Lego characters positioned here and there this could be just another amusement park. They are basically in the business of collecting money but that‚Äôs it!There is no attention to detail or to customer satisfaction!! They need to take some classes from Disney. This is a poor excuse for an amusement park. As one that stands behind such a big name as LEGO, it should be spectacular!Not worth it!!! Go to Disney instead, that‚Äôs where the magic is!!",1.0

908,A 2D1N Trip To Lego Malaysia,Good for small kid and not much to do as most of the shops outside legoland is not opened.But for a short getaway for kid will be fine. ,3.0
909,For family with kids min 100cm and 5 yrs old,"Good place. Simple. We waited for our daughter turns 5+ before visiting Legoland. Good decision. Any younger, kids won't be able to appreciate the activities or play some rides. Food rather expensive. Nasi lemak combo and curry chicken combo ranging from RM28 and RM30. Can have more shows. Can do with live parade like Disneyland. 4D shows was excellent. Better than Ironman in HK Disneyland. Ninjago was a let down. Too much talking. But salute to local talents behind the  movement of Ninjago puppets. Great job! One word of advise to the talented actors behind Ninjago. Your talent is only good in Legoland. Limited career mobility outside this market. Rides were decent. Lego education for young children was good. All Legoland staffs from ticketing entrance to those that walking around are friendly. They smile and greeted us. Only exception was the Chinese lady who do Lego engraving in the shop. No smile and unfriendly. Park can make do with fireworks or later closing time especially for shops. Toilets were clean for Msian standard. Overall, it's a good international theme park. Will return again. Better improve on overall standards, else 20th Century Fox Genting might be a competitor. Perak's MAPS can be forgotten because ppl said they cheat by not full opening. Suggest Legoland to move towards robotics from it's Technic range. Robotics and coding are the future.",4.0
910,Not nice and old,"We also travelled from Singapore on 2/1/18 by bus and yes the Singapore customs lines were so slow it was ridiculous.But we thought getting there would all be worth it. What a mistake one day of my life I will never get back.The rides are old, half of them were under repair so they were closed, no information about that before going in or no discount offered. The only ride worth doing was the virtual roller coaster, but yes be prepared to stand in line for a long time. Cars with 4 seats were only taking 2 people due to lack of staff training so your waiting a lot longer than needed.If you have children over 12 years old they will get board very quickly. Better do Universal studios on Sentosa Island save time and stress.",2.0
911,Disappointing ,"We arrived at Legoland around 11am on Christmas Eve. The sign to Water Park was unclear and we ended up at the wrong queue towards theme park. When we managed to get to Water Park, to our surprise, the lockers are all FULL. Imagine having to take care of the bags with wallet n phone while we are there. It‚Äôs really unacceptable. The food n drinks are also very expensive, cost MYR30-40 for a single dish of chicken rice or fried chicken. Will not be back ",3.0
912,Great holiday at Legoland,"Planning your trip here? Make sure your kid's height is 100cm and more. Most rides have height requirement, so kids below this height requirement may miss out a lot of them. I got my bags checked but i managed to bring some packet drinks for the kids. But please avoid bringing too much food (unless its for babies) as they may get confiscated. We got the annual pass and feel that it is worth it for kids below 10 yrs old. Teenagers may find this park boring. We spent two days (using our annual pass) and had great time at both wet park as well as the dry park. We also went on a non-peak weekend so we managed to go ride multiple times and thoroughly enjoyed the park. Can't wait to come again. 5 star!",5.0
913,The Legoland Malaysia Hotel (2016),"Pros:- Nicely themed rooms- Clean bathrooms with good quality toiletries- In-room puzzle/treasure hunt to find Lego freebies- Swimming pools are nice with oversized Legos to play- Kid-friendly lobby (night movies, lego play area, shows and mascot appearances)- Polite and helpful staff- Good picture quality cable channels- Adjacent to Legoland Theme Park and Legoland Water Park- Breakfast buffet has a wide variety of food- There is mall beside the hotel with good restaurants- Legos everywhere- From Singapore, it can be reached via coachCons:- WiFi connection is not reliableStay Again?Yes. When we visit Legoland again.",4.0
914,Tips for your Legoland visit (first time),"If you have children under 3 years old:1. Take them to the playgrounds. They will enjoy the playgrounds more than the rides because toddlers become monsters in long queues.2. Some places worth the wait for toddlers: Legoland Express, Plane Ride, Driving School (there are two, one for toddlers, the other for older children), Lost Kingdom Adventure, Merlin's Challenge (a bit wild), Royal Joust. Rides other parents suggest but we didn't have enough time to try: Beetle Bounce, Boating School, Rescue Academy, 3. Go for Duplo Express which is in the Duplo Playtown playground for a quicker ride on the train. The queues are not as long as the ones in Legoland Express, and you can go multiple rounds during non-peak days.4. There is a baby care room near the Playtown playground, next to Pizza Mania but it is only open during the weekends and public holidays. Another baby care room is available near the entrance. Ask guest services for instructions.5. Bring your own strollers if you have them. There are plenty of stroller parking spots right outside each rides -- note that some places have covered/sheltered stroller parking areas (you don't have to leave them out in the sun). You can rent strollers at the guest services area but they don't appear to be comfortable to nap in. #justsaying6. In the playgrounds, please follow your children closely if they are of toddler age and trying to traverse the weird ladder/step-design leading up to the slides. The steps are too high for children below the age of 3. They could have a tumble especially when they are tired out from all the playing.7. Bring drinking water and MAKE your children drink them. It is hot here, and there are no free drinking fountains. You have to purchase your drinking water inside the park. The cheapest we could find was RM3 per 500ml bottle in one of the cafes.For parents with older children, don't miss:1. Lego Race VR Coaster (long wait)2. Dino Island (you WILL get wet) (little to no wait)3. Dragon Apprentice4. The Dragon5. The Water ParkA few other things to note:1. Hero Passes are RM80 per person and are only valid for 7 rides, not all of them.2. The Lego Studios 4D Cinema has shows at 30 minute intervals (non-peak). If you're taking your children, put caps on them because in certain shows, you get unnecessarily wet and the aircon is on full-blast.3. At the Aquazone Wave Racers there are buttons on the platform surrounding (but outside) the rides that children can press to get the racers extra wet. You'd be surprised at how long this simple button can keep young children busy.4. If you have the annual pass, remember to grab the free parking ticket from the Guest Services area before you leave to get your car. Visitors without annual passes have to pay RM10 for parking.5. If you visit during peak periods there are more events happening and there are more facilities available to the public. If you visit during non-peak periods, the queues are shorter but run a check of the weather forecast before you go.6. If you arrive at opening hours, by 3PM, expect your children to desperately need a nap but for ""some reason"", fighting off your efforts to put them to sleep. There are benches all over the park for this power nap. Make use of them.7. The bathrooms are clean. We used the one behind Pizza Mania which was empty (no wait). The bathrooms near the rides closer to the entrance have much longer queues.8. If you have annual passes, you can come near 4PM for the water park section. I see a lot of visitors coming in around that time, clad in swimwear. It makes sense because the weather isn't as hot as it was near noon time.About Premium Annual Passes (themepark+waterpark)We got ours at RM320 during a special online promotion, but on the day we visited, they offered an RM80 top up on a 1-day combo ticket (RM200) for an annual pass. It was a one-day special. So if you don't have an annual pass yet, keep an eye out for these promotions before you buy.With a Premium annual pass, you get discounts on pretty much everything you buy inside Legoland, food, merchandise, souvenirs, and you don't have to pay for the parking (RM10). I was hesitant to get the annual pass but when you take all of these things into consideration, it was a bargain. There is the Awesome pass, which is an annual pass but just for the themepark (no waterpark), there are far fewer benefits.About Using your Annual Passes (first time)If you got your annual pass tickets online, you need to register at the park to get your Photo ID. When you arrive at Legoland, enter the park using your ticket by scanning the barcode (on the printed ticket). Then head to the Guest Services on the right to fill in a form and get your photo taken for your Photo ID. The process is quick and painless, depending on how many people are waiting in line to do the same. I was not asked for my IC or passport, even though I brought them, just in case.At the same place, you can also get a sticker for your child (stick this on their clothes) bearing their name and a special code. Staff members can check the code to get your phone number and call you in case your child got separated from you. Remember to transfer the sticker when you change your children out of their wet clothes.Waterpark tips are not included in this review.",4.0
915,Nice but old,"We was staying in Singapore and decided to take a day trip to LegoLand. But was disappointed by how run down the place is. The miniature land is quite nice but the quality of the rides are not. The 4d movie is so bad and not much help there neither. I think it is not worth it if you have to travel from Singapore as it was such a hassle going through custom there and back (we stucked at Singapore‚Äôs custom for nearly two hours). Compare to Universal Studio Singapore, they can not compete ",3.0
916,3rd time coming here and still exciting,"Legoland has been one of our favorite theme parks in Malaysia. Considering we love playing Lego bricks, visiting this attraction has quite routine within 4 years. But currently, Legoland is having a lot of construction for updates and also some maintanance. Some places are looking old and needing to have extra maintanance. But some new feautures have been added such as Star Wars,  Ninjago, and Lego Race. They are all totally fun to ride. Especially,  Lego Race with VR device while riding a roller coaster.The ticket price is more expensive than three years ago, but some they have promo like 1 adult ticket and will get free entry for 1 child. You just have to find the promo anywhere. The current adult ticket for foreigner is 199 RM. ",4.0

918,Nice experience,"Never been before to a Legoland, or any other theme park, however it was a nice experience and the Waterpark is extremely fun. As an advice I would recommend leaving enough time to cross the border if you are traveling from Singapore, at least 3 hours, additionally if you are traveling with young children, of less than 1.10m height or 6 years old, you should be aware that they will only be able to get into half of the attractions.",4.0
919,Good place although not too large,"Only in 4 hours,most of the rides can be played by my kids (7 and 3 years old).If you are planning to legoland,2 days is more than enough to explore Theme park and Water park.Avoid weekend when you travel to Theme park/water park.",4.0

We only managed to take a car drive ride, aeroplane, train ride & VR roller coaster. Average of 30 mins of waiting time but it was abt 1.5hr waiting time for VR roller coaster. Would prefer USS which has more rides but for young children, Legoland is a good place to introduce thrill rides. USS thrill rides are more sophisticated than Legoland. Teens would prefer USS.",3.0
923,"Good amusement park, food can be better","If you have kids ages between 6 to 10, then it's a good place to spend time with them. For a six year old, she can ride almost all rides in the park. Ten years old no problem, it's getting them to rides certain rides with the six years old you might have a problem...;)Lines are not that long, so no point buying the Vip pass. Suggest you visit Legoland day one and day two water park, otherwise you will be rushing to places and rides. One should take your time after all this is a family outing and you want to spend quality time with the kids.The food here is really not good at all, we had pizzas. First it's frozen dough, the cheese topping is inadequate, sauce is too salty (straight from a can, maybe) and the price point is way over price. Actually for that price it should at least serve a better pizza. If you can try and eat at other place, personally I don't recommend the pizza over there.The kids loved the driving school and they had a blast getting their ""driving license"", despite one or two accidents.",3.0
924,Improvements Needed,Overall it was a reasonable place to spend the day with the family. Queue were not that long for most of the ride except the VR roller coaster. Car park located too far from the entrance with no cover walk way nor security which is BAD!. Food expensive. Left at park at closing time and there was no lighting along the way to the car park or any security personnel sighted. One good thing is all the staff speaks some English which is good.

925,Waiting time ,If u are thinking to go both water park and Legoland on the same day it‚Äôs will be a waste as time is not enough. Every game need to q at Legoland ,3.0
926,I will go again,"We went on a weekday (Xmas week) and it wasnt too packed. The weather was so hot but there was no shelter to rest. Like one traveler mentioned, go for the outdoor stations FIRST when its not raining. Rides were fun for the kids. Car License can be purchased at RM25. Ride is FOC.The staff were absolutely friendly and nice. I saw a girl having problems driving the little car and the staff sat by her to step on the accelerator while the child make her turns. Staff sat by her throughout the ride.All the lego figurines were fantastic but needs a little maintenance thou. Food was affordable. we got a set of hotdog bun + drink = RM12Then again, the benches have no shelters. Toilet was clean. Stollers were OOS when we went. RM50 refundable deposit. Single and Twin strollers avail.We didnt have time to go through each theme in detail and it had already taken us 3 hours. Will probably need 5-6hours to go through every theme and ride on weekdays.I will go again to explore those areas i didnt managed to last week. Every ride looks fun!Grab drop off at level 2 (take escalator) / Taxi Stand (level 1)Convenience store, food and push cart stores are available.KSL to Legoland by Grab = RM23Legoland to Hello Kitty Land = RM6buy tickets online and scan at the gate. Tips: Bring more than a bottle of water. Limited choices for proper meals. Have a full meal before going and snack there would be a better choice.",5.0
927,"Well, not too bad after all","Not sure what I was expecting but I was pleasantly surprised. My family and I have done a range of theme parks - Disney Paris/Tokyo and Lotte World. I would say as a whole package for a 9 and 4 yr old in tow - this suited us pretty well. It clearly doesn't have the awe and wonder of Tokyo Disney but it catered for us really well.It helps that our youngest is 110cm and had she been 6 she would have been able to go on everything.Look, all the lego is weathered but Malaysia is always hot and I am not sure anything could withstand the continuous hot sun. I do feel like they need a rolling program to replace their tired looking Lego - just to bring back some sparkle. The park says it opens at 10, yet we were in for half 9 and had been and completed our first ride by 10. My advice would be turn left through the gates and go and do the VR rollercoaster - if you have smaller ones, turn right and do the boat ride. These are the 2 rides with the biggest lines.If you do the ride that is like the log ride - YOU WILL GET DRENCHED! heaps of fun - but very wet.My kids loved the day - so it must be alright!",4.0
928,Lots of fun for the Lego enthusiast,The park is great.  Not Disneyland but still a good day for the Lego enthusiast.  We (2 adults plus 8 yer old) had a good day at the park and a day was more then enough time.  If you can I recommend getting a VIP expedition . Starts with breakfast at 9am and gives you a guide until 230.  The best bit  is you get to go to the front of the line all day.  This makes it a really easy day with no lining up.  If we lived local we would go again ,4.0

932,Legoland- A must visit ,"Legoland Malaysia is an awesome holiday activity. The roller coaster wasn‚Äôt opened but overall wonderful place. The Hot pass is not advisable as it can‚Äôt be used for most rides and the concept isn‚Äôt similar to express at Sunway Lagoon or fast pass in Disney. Also, I‚Äôd advise one day for the legoland park and one day for the water park if you‚Äôd want to make the most of the trip. ",4.0
933,Not up to expectation,"There is long queue for the rides. One roller coaster under mantainence. After long wait, we gave up on the rides. Spent one day at themepark Legoland but not Waterpark or Ninja park. Food is limited and quite expensive. We ended buying lots of Lego for 10year boy. We took shuttle from Hotel Jens which was punctual.",3.0

937,Legoland and Legoland Water Park,"Great day out if you have little people. Our boys (aged 11 and 16) were non-plussed by many of the rides in Legoland. Main roller coaster was closed due to maintenance. Othe Ninja 4D roller coaster was too busy and then at 4.30 you could ride the ride but without the 4D experience! Log flume was fun. The highlight I think would be the model village of the countries made in lego. The water park (you need a separate ticket for this park) had some good slides but there were queues. However, it was Christmas Day and I think that was to be expected. Gettting to and from Legoland is a bit tricky. We travelled by Uber on the way there (20RM) but had problems on the way back. Uber guy on the return quoted 20RM and then doubled to 40RM. We refused and took a taxi. Taxi was metered and cost 60 RM!!",3.0

943,"Pretty well maintained, worth a visit","Visited on 23 Dec and arrived slightly after 10am, not too crowded. Popular rides like the driving school and boat ride took about 30 minutes  queuing time. Other rides are reasonably quick. Buying the LEGO toys here is a rip off and much more expensive than buying it in Australia. Food choice is limited and obviously not cheap. Anyway my 7 years old enjoyed it.",4.0

945,Fun!,Water park and theme park are both amazing! Perfect for kids 9 years old and below. Rides are not too ‚Äúscary‚Äù (according to my 6-year old daughter) compared to Disneyland theme park rides. The Italian restaurant in the theme park is nice.,4.0
946,"For the same price, Universal Studios is more worth it!","Even though it is the school holiday now, and so near to Christmas, there are very few visitors.   There is a reason for that.  Legoland Malaysia is so small and it is just not worth the fees.  There really isn‚Äôt much to do here, very limited rides. 5-6 hours max, that's all you need.Also Food outlet choices are not all that great, and many eateries were closed.For the same price, Universal Studios is more worth it!",3.0
947,Good family funtime,A nice place to bring your young kids to. Best to book tickets from the website rather than buying on the spot as there were longer queues on the ticket stalls when we arrived at the entrance (luckily I bought mine earlier). This place is really baby and child-friendly. All toilets were equipped with a baby changing table for ease of taking care of the kids (this include both male and female toilets). My 4 year old son really loved the build-your-own lego car since he was quite a competitive boy and loved to race with the other kids.Food was slightly pricey in the LEgoland but fret not mall of medini is just outside where you can eat various types of food.,4.0
948,Fun place for a certain age,There's 2 side of LEGOLAND. The dry and the wet. The dry side doesn't have many shades areas this making the play really hot and tiring. There's age restrictions for some of the game. I have 2 kids and so it make it a little more challenging to manage as they may be split at times. The wet area is fun. It's not very huge but good enough for the kids. Comes with quite a fair bit of slides and wave pool. Ideal for family.,4.0
949,Overrated Hotel and theme park ,"Visited Legoland during the December holidays and decided to stay 3D2N at their hotel. 1st impression that was quite disappointing was the check in counters. Though they had multiple counters, only 2 were opened and service was so slow. When we reached our room, we all had red paints on our clothes and hands and we found out that they had just painted the outside of our room and there were no sign being put up. Called the concierge and the manager arranged to have all our clothings cleaned after he did some investigation. The hotel room was decent but materials used seems a bit cheap and flimsy. You have to choose between 3 time slots for the breakfast and the queue for breakfast was atrocious. We were looking at 1000 plus people all packed at the inside and outside of the buffet area. We visited the theme park on the last day and because it was the holiday period, queue was bad at both the ticketing booth and the rides inside. Overall a average experience and we won‚Äôt we going during the holiday season anytime soon.",3.0
950,A day at Legoland ,"1. It situated about 20min drive from second link, bridge that connected SINGAPORE & MALAYSIA. ( The bridge traffic could be congested during certain time or weekday).2. Being to a few Legoland ( Carlsbad California, Orlando Florida & Copenhagen Denmark). The park a bit small compare to the Legoland I being.3. Need a bit improvement & maintenance. Found some ride, toilet & Park not to par or standards.4. Overall, my Son enjoy it but like he say, it will be our last time to this park.",4.0
951,Legoland in December!,"We only visited the Theme Park as the kids are not really into swimming but the Wet Park sounds nice if you will stay longer.  Park is open from 10am to 6pm. During peak timings, queues can be annoying so try to visit during the off-peak season.It is quite enjoyable for kids and adults. Food is a plenty in the park but a bit pricey (as expected).  The rides are fun and exciting.Will definitely visit again. 2x in 2017!!!",5.0
952,Kids day out,"Visited Legoland JB with my daughters and both of them thoroughly enjoyed the 1 day theme park outing.I was a little worried when i decided to make this trip during the school holidays with my daughters (age 9 and 5). But surprisingly when we arrived around 10am the ticket counter was not as crowded as i expected. The ticket counter staff was very friendly in assisting us to explain the ticket pricing and even suggested that i get the theme park ticket first instead of combo and in the event i did managed to cover the theme park i can visit their customer service to pay for the differences to the wet park. We started to tour with visiting the miniland lego which comprises architectures and buildings from Malaysia and other countries, the famous ones are KLCC, Taj Mahal, Angkor Wat and few others. However my kids were impatient to go and try their rides and other activities. Key rides not to be missed (for adults & kids):- Mini dragon roller coaster- Dragon roller coaster- Virtual Reality roller coaster (the new addition to the theme park)- Dino Island (it's located in the theme park but you will still get wet, so best if you keep it as a last ride before you leave the theme park)Kids stuffs:- Lego driving school- Boat ridingFew points which i think might be worth sharing:1. If you are visiting Legoland for 1 day, it's best to buy the theme park ticket first rather than the combo ticket (however i'm not sure if foreigner will be allowed to just pay the differences if you decide to visit wet park later on the day). Best to reconfirm with the ticket counter agent. 2, Minimum height for most of the rides is about 110cm and usually if your children is around 110cm to 130cm, they have to be accompanied by an adult.3. Children below 7 or 8 years old are prohibited from wearing the VR glass but they can still enjoy the ride.4. One small bottle of mineral water or any other drinks will cost you RM5.00Although we were totally tired but we did enjoyed ourselves. My take - the ticket & f&b prices might be steep, but it's worth the visit if you wants to have great time with your kids.",4.0
953,Getting crowded,This is our first visit after they have the VR coaster. Bought a 2 day combo pass. Previously we had a annual pass. I find sitting on the ride without wearing VR is more thrilling. Wearing VR seems like just a 4D ride with seats that move. The rest of the rides are getting crowded. Didn‚Äôt have to queue so long previously. Water park is a lot better. But queue is also long for some of the more popular rides. ,4.0
954,Fun Water Park ,It is fun to play in the water park of Legoland. The place is filled with plenty of life guards to keep on watching the safety of children while playing in water. The only setback is insufficient of lockers and having meal in the park is quite expensive and not that tasty.,4.0
955,Everything was awesome,"We loved Legoland, motivated to go particularly by our Lego-loving 8-year old. It's definitely for a sub-teen audience so all of ours loved it. We had read that the queues would be bad, but we went in the Singapore school holidays and we had hardly any queues - so we did many of the rides twice. The rides were good and varied, and the Legoland stuff was impressive too, particularly the buildings, ports, harbours and other creations in Mini Land. Definitely the wettest log flume I have ever been on. Ever. Shoes still soaked one day later. Tip: wear flip flops. VR rollercoaster was a cool experience, and the Ninjago ride was fun too! Watch out for the 90 minute drive from Singapore through the border, and then the same back again, but if you plan it in you'll have a great day. ",5.0
956,A value for money spent.,A real wonderland for children. Great deals on prices plus hotel reasonably priced as well. I strongly reccomend framilies with children to visit thi8s place.,4.0
957,Good for family outing,"Legoland is primarily a outdoor theme park with a few indoor attractions like the Mini Star Wars exhibit. With a few months old baby and a 2 year old toddler on a very sunny day, we had to quickly seek indoor attractions. It was quite a walk 10mins from the outdoor public carpark. There was another small indoor playroom where kids can sit around tables to play with mini Lego bricks. We also queue almost 25mins to take the train ride around the park as we couldn't board the first train that was full. With young ones we had to leave thereafter. Spent about 2 hours plus. Thankfully, we got to the carpark just when it started to rain. Do be prepared for the tropical weather here. Theme park also had a water park which we didn't go. There were other rides for 5 to 8 years old. Best for children of this age group. ",3.0
958,"Lego, lego, lego, lego........and some rides!","This was my family's 2nd visit to Legoland. Our first visit was 2 years ago.This time, we went on a Sunday, which isn't a public holiday for Johor. As such, we were hoping that there wouldn't be such a big crowd. We arrived at 9.40am. Although the park only officially opened at 10am, we were allowed in to wander around the park, while waiting for the rides to start at 10am.As we were early and there wasn't much of a crowd, we managed to get on most of the rides without much waiting (other than the Ninjago VR coaster which took about an hour!).Lost Kingdom Adventure - A car takes you through a tunnel, and you need to aim and shoot at gems on the wall. Aim for the red gems as they carry more points than the yellow gems!Ninjago The Ride - A car takes you through a tunnel where there are screens with the bad guys, and by making ninja movements with your hands/arms, you can blast the bad guys and help the ninjas defeat them. Hubby got a bit too excited with his kung fu moves and ended up with a sore shoulder afterwards! The Great Lego Race VR Coaster - The latest roller coaster. This is essentially the same `Projet X' ride that was here 2 years ago, but virtual reality goggles have been added to the rid, adding to the experience of the rollercoaster.Dragon - Roller coaster!! Not for young children or adults with medical conditions!Dragon's apprentice - a much milder version of Dragon roller coaster.4D theatre - Essentially 3D animated films lasting 20 mins, with an added 4th dimension (4D) which was wind and water effects. Not the best 4D that I've seen, but still a nice rest period in between rides where you can sit and enjoy the airconditioning!Star Wars - for Star Wars and Lego buffs onlyMini Asia legoland is fascinating. KLCC and KL tower were added to the collection of famous asian buildings last year. Overall, a good day out with the family. My youngest is already pleading with us to come again next year.",4.0
959,Below expectation given the expensive admission fee!,For some reasons it was a rainy season in Johor in Dec. It starts to rain around 3pm everyday while we were there. The number of attractions are limited to start with and the number deteriorates when the park have to shut down the outdoor attractions when the rain starts. We did not complete all the attractions because of the rain. Otherwise a 1 day admission is good enough to finish all the attractions.The cost of the foods in the park is way more expensive than I thought; even comparing it with Sunway Lagoon in KL. However we ended with early departure due to the heavy rain thus we did not consume any foods in the park.In summary I personally think the park maybe meant for Singaporean consumption only as it's not worth the value for Malaysian. Anyway it's ok to pay one visit just to get the experience.,4.0
960,Best for kids below 7 years,"Went with wife & two children aged 6 * 7 years. Basically the place, as the name suggests, is about lego bricks, and more lego bricks... quite fascinating though with all the stuff that they've created with Lego bricks... Though if you have older kids they're going to get bored pretty soon... most rides are kiddies rides, with the sole exception being the new VR roller coaster ride which is a great combination between Samsung VR headgear & a roller coaster... All in all you can do the park in like 5 hours max... & for the same money, Universal Studios is a better bet!!",3.0
961,Good for Kids,"A good all-day hangout with the family, kids will definitely enjoy the park but for adult it might be a bit boring. Considering the price and the rides available, don't think will revisit anytime again soon unless there is something new or interesting.",3.0
962,Midweek visit is better,"We had purchased a 2 day pass to the water park and the theme park as part of our hotel package.As advised by friends, we went for the water park on the first day. As it was midweek, there was not much of a crowd which we were thankful for. Wait times for most rides was 15-30 minutes. Food was fairly priced for a theme park. We felt the wave pool could benefit from a display telling what times will the waves actually be happening. Also the walls could use a good scrubbing as there was obvious calcium buildup.The rides were good and fun. What I could not understand was that there was a lift for one of the rides requiring a raft (Red Rush) but not for the other (Brick Blaster)? Would not logic dictate that lifts would have been installed for both considering that the Red Rush ride with the raft lift was actually the ride that require less distance from picking up the raft to the set off point in comparison to the Brick Blaster. We found the Build A Raft river the most relaxing and spend a fair bit of time on it. However we resisted playing with the foam lego bricks on account of all the mould visible on it.The 2nd day we visited the Lego Theme park. Unfortunately, the weather forecast was not looking good with promise of thunderstorms and heavy downpours. So we tried our best to have a go on all the rides. My biggest shock was when we attempted the Dino Island ride. The service staff were telling everybody 30 minutes, 30 minutes with no explanations except for some words in Malay. There was no queue or anything. It was only when we enquire with another staff member that he clarified in English that there is an issue with the ride and it will take approximately 30 minutes to rectify. I believe that in consideration of the theme park being the no 1 attraction in Johore, that said staff should have made an attempt to communicate in English.We absolutely love the VR Roller Coaster and the headsets that provides more immersion. Word of caution to those easily nauseated, do not use the headsets. The reason being when riding roller coasters, if you can anticipate the turns and plunges, you will not feel so sick but with the VR headsets on, you cannot anticipate so it make you susceptible to nausea. As above with the calcium buildup, the Miniland was looking the same with the lego pieces looking very tired and weathered. Perhaps in addition to service staff, there should be staff that are capable of replacing the lego pieces?So in conclusion, yes the theme park is worth a visit. But make sure that you check the weather forecast prior so to not be washed out. Ohh... ... Biggest grouse for me. No COFFEE! I for the life of me could not get a hot cup of fresh coffee anywhere in the theme park.",3.0
963,Fun day in Legoland,"We reached the Legoland around lunch time, so the first place we visit in theme park was the  restaurant. It's quite easy to find some food here and the price quite friendly too.Kids enjoy the rides, especially my teenage girl. And there are also playgrounds for toddlers. Our favourite is the Star Wars Mainland which display scenes from Star Wars movies in legos. Though the weather is hot even in December with a little bit rain, so if you planed to visit Legoland in December don't forget to bring un umbrella and wear your most comfortable clothes and slippers or shoes. But you can also buy umbrella and rain coat at the shops in which you can also buy some Lego souvenirs, merchandise, stationary, and more. Quite sure we will be back to visit the water park.",4.0
964,Right place for family with young kids,This was our 2nd visit. we spend one day for both park. Kids spend most time at their water park which i find much much better and clean compared to Sunway Lagoon. their water park suits kids from age 3 and above. Lifeguard is at every corner!,5.0
965,Meh,As a family we had a good time but the rides were fairly mediocre. It was clean which was nice. Typical over priced food for theme parks.The hero pass (fast pass for lineup) was not worth the money. Very disorganized system that resulted in getting through half of the line up at best. ,3.0

We visited the theme park on Sunday but the queue for every ride was rather short. The rides are quite entertaining but don't expect it to be the same as USS. It took us around 2 hours from Singapore and we spent 5 hours in the park.,4.0
968,Fun for the family Dec 2017,"We went to Legoland for the second time now and it's worth it. If you have very young kid below 3 years old ... Then he/she can't do much there. However there are few places for this young kids to play like train's and trains and trains .. hahaha. Food is expensive inside .. maybe to cator for Singapore dollars , for Malaysians please come in with a stomach full. Maybe if the kids are hungry ... You can get for them something there.There is a shuttle service from Singapore to Legoland .. seems convenient who wants to visit Universal Studio one day and next day Legoland.Me and my family really enjoyed our time here.",4.0
969,Worth the visit,Reached Legoland at 3pm and only had 4hrs before it is closed. Crowd was less and average queue time is only 15 mins. Kids enjoyed the rides and shows especially Ninjago and Starwars. Parking costs RM10 per entry.Very friendly to family travelling with infant or young toddlers. Stroller rental is available and there will be an allocated space to park strollers at each rides or shows.,5.0
970,Worth a visit,"For families with young children, I suggest cater two days for this. We only catered for one day and only managed to explore the main park and had not enough time for the waterpark.At the main park, there are numerous rides for children, though at least half of them require children to be at least 110cm tall.Still enough rides for those above 90cm. Lots of open areas and playgrounds. Also has many seating areas for resting in between. My 3yo boy did have lots of fun with the rides.Quite a number of dining options within the park, with very reasonable pricing- about S$10 SGD for a set lunch.  Though most of the giantic Lego displays are showing signs of wear and tear, making the theme park look weary and old, the park's cleanliness is still quite well maintained.Quite sure we will be back again.",4.0
971,Nice place for kids ,If you are seeking something like universal in Singapore then behold your thoughts and visit. This place is mainly made for kids in mind. 95% of rides my kid (6 years) was able to enjoy with ease. It's a nice family place with just enough rides and activities to keep you going. ,4.0
972,Average with some highlights,"Even though it‚Äôs just across the border, it‚Äôs still quite a trek to get here from Singapore. During busy periods, getting to and through the customs and immigration processes can take an hour each way. The park itself is surprisingly showing signs of poor upkeep despite its relative youth. Rides entertained the kids enough, but nothing was particularly amazing. Crowd management was poorly done. We didn‚Äôt purchase the express passes. Understandable for those who are short on time, but the whole idea of buying privilege doesn‚Äôt sit well. For those who did buy express passes, they were still pushed through the same lines as us (ie, no separate line unlike places like universal studios Singapore), which seem to create both embarrassment for those apologetically forcing their way through the line with those passes, and annoyance for those who had been waiting in the scorching sun for long periods of time. As expected, food was very average and overpriced. ",3.0

976,Legoland Water Park,"This water park is quite small and the rides are not so trill to compare with Sunway Lagoon. This park is more suitable for young children age range 6-12 in order to take all the rides. Even though it is small but it doesn't stop the kids to have fun like mine. Although number of rides are limited but the kids will take it over and over again. Shoe racks located around the park, safety jackets for adult and child provided for FREE and no rental for floats as it provided as well. Locker rental - small RM20 and large RM40 per day for multiple use. One of the things that surprised me is the water park staffs are so well-trained, polite and helpful. The staff will take time to explain how to ride and the safety precautions before the start of each ride and it keep going on and on. Staffs are cheerful and always joke and have fun with the visitors. I would like to give my BEST compliments to all the staff at Legoland Water Park. So far, this is the best service from all the theme park that I visited in Malaysia. My kid had so much fun!",4.0
977,First trip to legoland with my kids,My kids had a lot of fun.  Place is clean and there were not many people so its was kind of fast for every rides that we wanted to try.

978,Plenty of Fun for Kids,"Lego land in Johor is a wonderful place for kids to play learn and enjoy all the rides and shows. Very magnificent Lego scale models of major buildings in Malaysia and Asia. Interesting scale models with movements in airports, train and bus stations ports. Thrilling rides and action 4D movies. Adjacent is their water park where kids and adults can spend several hours of family fun.You and your family must visit",4.0
979,Poor Customer Experience,"Feel like cheated with 4pm check-in and 11am check-out. Where got hotel in the world have this kind of odd hour checkin and checkout time. Basically they just want you to spend more money to either do early checkin or late checkout. Imagine parks open at 10am, and you have no where to settle down before you can really enjoy the parks.Second bad experience, the hotel bell boy jump queue to use the lift while me and kids holding luggages and have been waiting for the lift at first. The hotel bell boy dare to ask us to wait for the next lift. Really sucks experience, customer second place?Third, they issue paper based day pass for the theme parks. Imagine how can you keep the pass from water when you are in the water park? When asked, the front desk staff asked us to rent a locker instead. So they want you to spend money to use the locker. Money face and customer experience last.Fourth, why do maintenance during park operating hours? So what‚Äôs the point paying the money but you cannot use some of the facility? Fifth, why includes a water theme facility in the dry park? Which 100% you will get wet? I know why, i realized they install a few dryers outside the facility which cost you a sum of money to dry your body after  you get wet. No money no talk?Sixth, you cannot bring food into the parks, nvm, they have restaurants inside the park. But the food are sucks and the food costs 2 adults and 3 kids more than RM100. I get a decent sea foods with this price outside. They just think you are not spending enough with the RM1800++ with the 2 days combo package yet .Do not get me wrong, the parks are nice if you have not been there before and it is good experience. But I can‚Äôt feel they put customer experience first, and they are not doing a sincere business and why should I pay if they are not sincere enough",3.0
980,Awesome Day Out with the Kids,"We have a child aged 4 and she is hitting the bare minimum height to enjoy some rides. This is about the only theme park she has been to so far that allows her to ride more than half of what is available. She thoroughly enjoyed herself!The day was extremely hot and bright during the morning and afternoon. Sunblock, shades, hats, portable fans and plenty of water are highly recommended. However, the theme park has you covered. There are places where you can go to that is air-conditioned throughout the park. There are also plenty of seats under the shades.At about 4pm, the sky turned dark and it started to pour heavily. So umbrella or ponchos are a must too. Be prepared for a swing on weather. Because the rain was so strong, the shelters did not do much and we took shelter at the shops instead.Dec is a holiday period but the crowd was decent. The longest queue was about 30 minutes, most rides have about 5-15 minutes waiting time.We did not bring our strollers so we rented one. The strollers are not suitable for sleeping in, so I suggest to bring your own if you intend to let your child catch a nap at the park. There are plenty of food option at the park. It is easy to get drinks too and light snack as the push carts are everywhere. I love it.But the one that takes the cake for me is their baby care. We have an 8mo old infant and obviously I was prepared to rough it out having to carry him when he wants to nap. I was also worried in the morning that he might catch a fever because of the heat. So their baby care was a blessing! They have a complete area for us parents to nurse, feed, change and cool down! The area is also safe enough for me to let him crawl around. A good stretch for him as he needs to expend his energy. The place is also well controlled by the staff, so it is peaceful and quiet for the little one to nap. They even have a crib prepared!We will definitely be back sooner than we expected! ",5.0
981,Great place ,"We had amazing time in legoland and the kids enjoyed every activities available. This will be fun for those between 6-15 year old children. Bring your own drinks, and small bags. The locker is RM 20 for small locker and RM 60 for big locker. And the locker area will close at 6pm. ",5.0
982,My kids love it!,This theme park was so fun. My 5years old daughter love this place so much. She keep asking me when we could visit Legoland again. This park filled with Lego creature and I was amazed. Also many rides that could play by kids as long as their height more than 100cm. The rides not so extreme. Mostly safety enough for kids. Although it was super hot here but the crowd not so tight so no need for long queieng. ,5.0
983,Great time with the kids,I‚Äôve been subscribing the annual pass since 2014 and this year we have upgraded to premium pass because my kids loves to play at the water park. The crowd is less during mid week even on school holidays. Kids loves the new vr coster and will definitely come again next year. Can‚Äôt wait to look what LEGOLAND Malaysia have to offer next year.,5.0
984,Amazing,"My kids really happy here. We were there since this place open at 10am till they were close at 5.30pm. The staf were very helpful, they give us advise to play in water  park first then the theme park because water park will be close if it rains. The food was good and worth with its price.",5.0

Most rides are for young children and is rather small for adults. The Ninja-Go Live Puppet Show is a must watch, half an hour show in a fully air conditioning, gave us lot  of fun and very entertaining. The Star-War exhibition is a must visit place in the park, main scenery set for all the Star-War episode are  build using LEGO bricks with light effect and sound, truly amazing. Bring a cap or hat on a sunny day, you might need it as it were get really hot and humid in the park.",4.0

We stayed in Johor Bahru city, next to City Square and just opposite the train and bus station.Took the hassle free, very low fare and comfortable bus services to/fro Legoland.If you are with children and plan to cover the theme and water park, i would suggest you do Day 1 - Theme park & Day 2 - Water park instead of both in 1 day.",4.0

992,Enjoyable,"It's a nice place to bring the kids for holiday. Tickets are a bit on the higher end, but it's a huge place to spend the whole day in.One downside is that a lot of open areas are uncovered, hence you can get wet or sun-burn depending on weather. Hopefully they added more shades to the open areas for a more comfortable visit.",4.0
993,Good birthday weekend for a child,"As Premium Annual Pass holders, we are back in LLM for a birthday weekend. This is the busiest we‚Äôve seen LLM compared to previous visits. Local school holiday in all of Malaysia. Still, queues for rides are still manageable.We get very good deals as PAP holders. For details of favourite rides, please refer to my older LLM reviews.As it is the Christmas season, some activities were catered for the festive season. First time for me to visit ALL OF Miniland, searching for The Santa minilander.Santa‚Äôs workshop was fun too. We got to make our own Lego Xmas decor. Fun!We also hoped we‚Äôd win a prize for the Advent Calendar draw... we didn‚Äôt. It was nonetheless good to see what the local staff had to offer. Nothing extraordinary, the spectacle could be better but LLM clearly supports local talents. Hence, ALL is ok.With PAP, meals at the Market Restaurant feels less like a rip-off :0).Likewise, we went with an extra guest, price for day ticket entry is 30% off with PAP. Take note that usually this is single entry only. But if you are staying at the LLM Hotel, ticket holder is permitted to enter provided that room key card is presented.",4.0
994,A park which you can cover reasonably in 1.5days,"Had the 2 day combo tickets, highly recommended it. Helps you to plan where to do depending on the kids level of every and weather. Water park is rather small. In the theme park there are many activities to be done if the kid is taller than 105cm. Anything shorter, then better wait till they are bigger. The kids that will enjoy most are lego fans, age 6  or more and 110cm or more .All queue area has an interactive lego play area, luckily we only queued for VR ride and the rest has not much or no queue when we were there.",5.0
995,Quaint and Cute,"I wanted to go to Legoland MY for my son. I want him to see the different structures built with Legos. We only got the 1D theme park ticket. The park was okay. Nothing fancy. Rides are definitely for kids. If you want the wild rides, this is not the place for you.  You should go to USS.  A half day activity in Legoland should be enough.",4.0
996,LEGOLAND Malaysia,"A short summary 1st...It's a fun place for kids and adults too..Not so crowded like USS...Ok now start my long story, Came on Monday 27 nov 17 but I know for sure can't check in to hotel so we wear simple ready for legoland 1st, we had our early lunch at 11am at old town white coffee at the only mall next to LEGOLAND (food even at the mall can be pricey too,but at least we got our kopi O before fun)...LEGOLAND isn't super big but there is alot of ride and show for children, even more then USS till we can't finish all after 6hrs inside the park..Toilets are very clean and drinks are RM5 for 1 small bottle and Milo at RM6 for a cup (I don't know is this consider expensive)...I know USS won't be this cheap...We are lucky that we didn't met with downpour or strong sun to BBQ us, when we arrived we just had a small drizzling and after an hour its stop but windy and not hot at all, so good to enjoy our 6hrs...The only down side is not much choices of food at the medini mall, we had our meals at 'The chicken rice shop', after the park we manage to finish up a full 6 person table full of foods...we paid RM117 for the foods...Look out for my 2nd review on water park on 28 Nov 17",5.0
997,"Not bad, but needs more maintenance.","I fell in love with this place. It brought out the child in me. The water parks are good too! I went on an off-peak season, so there were no lines to conquer and I could ride the rides as much as I want. The cafe and shops were pretty cool too. Vibrant and cozy, I enjoyed it very much Some points to note:When it comes to high profile / international-stage level theme parks like Legoland, attention to detail is crucial to provide the customers with the complete experience.I am referring of course to the Lego props and compound. from afar, the Legos look amazing, but when you take a closer look, the Legos are disgustingly dirty. What once was a white beautiful brick, turns grey, grimy, and gunky. Come on guys, as a Malaysian, I myself want theme parks from my country to be on par with the other Legolands in the world. The management should schedule regular clean-up / maintenance sessions for the park ensuring that the park stays in tip-top condition at all times. ",4.0
998,Entertaining,"Try to go there as early as possible, as the park closes at 7pm. We went during the off peak season, rainy and not crowded. You would want to try the roller coaster and visit the Star Wars attraction. For the kids, let they get a ""Drivers Licence"" when they ride on the karts in the traffic zone. ",4.0
999,Kids paradise,Went on Sunday. But less crowd. Don't have to queue for the rides. The most only to queue 5 to 8 mins. I think Ninja Go 4D is the most fun game among all for adults before the roller coaster VR. Food at restaurant is a little on the high side. Can't find the big main legoland signage at the main entrance. I believed is under construction. Can only take picture with the sign far on the hill. ,3.0
1000,Average at best!,Don‚Äôt have high expectations... was hard to keep my 9 year old engaged there. Nothing wrong with the place but just did not feel up to the standards of other international theme parks. Certainly not worth the trek from singapore.,2.0

Although it was supposed to be their bany care  opening hour (only open at 12noon onwards), at 12.30pm still lock.Legoland JB strictly not a friendly place for kids.",2.0
1002,Ok but......,Small version of the USA model and it is difficult to communicate with all staff in English.Construction currently ongoing but it does not inconvenience your visit.

Otherwise the same. My young ones still love it - car, boat, train or plane. Just be careful of the weather, extreme humid+hot and storms are frequent.Good to be here before Malaysia school hols start.",5.0
1007,Legoland trip,"Spent 2 nights at the Legoland hotel to visit lego land and could of spent longer. Waterpark was great, plenty of things to do with no lines at anything that we went on the day we were there. Food prices reasonable. Kids loved the lego boat building then racing. Day two we did the lego park, was there from open to close. Kids had a ball, and we didn't manage to do everything but did loads of things more than once (if that makes sense) our kids ages range from 5-14 and all had fun all day. They said they wish they could of done more lego building activities as we spent all day doing ride, so could of spent another day or two",4.0
1008,LEGOLAND,This place is truly suitable for young and old. The miniature buildings of significance are so amazing in their details and accuracy in color and size. Could spend hours.,5.0
1009,Great place for children or those who are young at heart (bonus if they are Lego fans!),"If you're going for more than two days, get the annual pass - it's worth it! There are boons that you get with having annual passes too.Personally for me, my favourite part about the park is that it embodies the spirit of a child (at least mine when I was one). Rides like the Kids Power Tower, the Ninjago Ride and the Fire Rescue Academy are by far my favourite and had LEGOLAND been about when I was a child, I would add the Driving School and the Duplo Playtown to the list too. The best things about these rides is that they give the power back to the child (or adult with a young heart!) and no matter how many times I return to the park, every time I get to the top of the Kids Power Tower, I still feel a satisfaction I couldn't get from the other rides.For a person like me who likes singing and humming or 'acting childish', LEGOLAND is amazing. It's the only place where you won't just feel out of place for acting so, but the place feels like it's made for you. It's the perfect place to daydream and play pretend. It's interesting to see how a lot of people seem to go on rides as if they're checking them off the list, snap photos and then move on in a very mechanical manner when personally for me, the best thing about the place is the ambience which if you let it, would transform you back into a child.If you've been here before several years back, a lot has changed since. There are the usual new rides and attractions but the trees have grown, giving a better shade, they added the 'mist fans' to the benches at the miniland and the huge helifans are a blessing on hot days. They may seem like minor changes but if you've been to LEGOLAND before, you would know how hot the place is and they really improve the quality of your experience.The staff are very attentive and the place and the rides are decidedly safe so long as you follow the protocols. They are particular about people following them so don't stand when they say you shouldn't or they would have to shut the game down so nobody gets hurt (and ruin the fun for everyone). They added extra seatbelts to the Kids Power Tower because inattentive parents had let their children stand on their seats and these little particulars make me feel that the children's safety are well thought for.If you can't bear the heat, bring a cap and an umbrella. On most days when we go  to LEGOLAND, it would rain at some point so when the sun is out, go on the outdoor games which would close in the event of a heavy downpour or a thunderstorm (and bring an umbrella or get one of their ponchos sold at the stores). When it does rain, go for the indoor activities. Get comfortable shoes as there are lots of walking involved. If there are event activities, join them! You might get some cool little gifts. It's no fun to rush through everything so if you think you'll enjoy a trip there, reserve a whole full day. For Muslims, they have two suraus (prayer rooms) at opposite ends of the park and all of the food at the parks are certified as halal, Alhamdulillah.If you're the kind of person who are looking for a good thrill, LEGOLAND might not be the best place for you. But if your idea of a good holiday is a day full of fun make believe and letting kids be kids, then LEGOLAND is the perfect place to go. If you're a Lego builder, the miniland and the plenty of lego structures scattered throughout the park would amaze you. We have no 'children' with us, we all have to get adult passes but it's still our number one vacation spot.",5.0
1010,Must visit for LEGO Lovers,"I have been to this themepark 2 times before and this is my 3rd visit. Overall, the theme park has changed a lot since my last visit, where the tree are all grown up, and make the park more comfortable now. We can see a big giant fan in the middle of the park and also lots of mist fans in between. There are also several indoor attractions such as Ninjago Live Show and Ninjago The Ride. I heard there will be a new attractions on this November 2017. Sure, I will be back again ...",5.0

1013,World class theme park for LEGO lovers,"We visited in early November during the off peak season. It rained, but usually for short periods, and the sun soon dried everything up. Loved that there were no lines for the rides and we could ride multiple times (especially fantastic for young children). Disadvantage is that there were a few things under maintenance or food outlets closed. But there were more than enough things to keep us busy for 2 days. My 2 year old couldn't go on many rides, so the water park's duplo splash safari and wave pool were great for her. My 5 year old loved the Dragon's apprentice roller coaster and Jr Driving school.",4.0

1016,For the Youngs & the Youngs at Heart!,I love and enjoyed both the Legoland Malaysia Theme Park and the Water Park.Both the young and the young at heart will definitely enjoy these two parks. The theme park features activities and rides for all the group ages whereas the water park will cater to different age brackets as well with their different pools.A day of visit would be enough to cover the two parks so it's better to at least give each park a day to explore and enjoy!,5.0
1017,Interesting to see everything made from lego,"It's interesting to see everything made from lego, but it's a really small place and the price they're charging makes me feel like money is better spent going to Universal Studios Singapore instead.

Better than Singapore USS but lose out to Sunway Lagoon. Cheers!!!,3.0
1035,Must visit place for lego lovers,"Legoland is in Johor Bahru which in itself is not a tourist destination and I was taking my chances when I planned this as one of my vacation destinations.To start with, the tickets can be booked online and there are loads of options / promotions going on, I had opted for open ticket which allows me to visit anytime within 6 months of booking.Uber has good coverage in JHB so one can take ride in same or opt for bus, hotel provided car etc.On the onset one gets a feeling it is built on similar lines of universal studios and to most part it is with an exception that most of the rides can indeed be taken by kids. They have washrooms and food joints at many places which adds to convenience.Do remember to carry your sunglasses and cap alongwith you as it is quite bit of walk going around the park.The models of various monuments which they have built are spectacular and one has to see it to believe it.Overall worth the visit and must see at least once for all Lego lovers !!!",5.0
1036,Enjoyable day with family,"The day out was fun. The attraction is most certainly aimed at young children. Note that there is a water park area that is segregated from the main attraction.There is also a Legoland Hotel but in my opinion Legoland is quite remote.There were many rides for children for all ages. Both of my sons loved the new Ninjago ride and the Legoland city cars. The 4d cinema was great, the train that rode around the whole attraction and the viewing tower too.The Star Wars area was a disappointing though; as we had expected it to be rude but it was lego build sets (still impressive).Overall there was child play areas and one even including a small train ride. All the children loved it. The food was nice and catered towards both Adults and Children. On an additional note, we travelled from Singapore to Malaysia and crossed over using a private taxi via the border. It was very easy and fluid without even stepping out of the MPV. You pay the first instalment when you arrive and the final instalment when you arrive at your finaldestination. You agree a time to be picked up. ",5.0

Liked it the previous two times but did think improvements in house keeping especially could be made. This time, we were greeted with the fact that the hotel pool is closed for maintenance. Never mind, I thought ~ until we got to the water park today. They've closed three attractions there as well for the same reason!  Come on Legoland! If you're going to do that, you should inform your guests. Or, have some sense and at least keep the pool at the hotel open. Why does maintenance have to take place at the same time? I feel a bit cheated.",3.0

1041,I wish I had more than 1 day to enjoy my inner child here...and a lot of money for my excess baggage,"We came on a day trip from Singapore, and when we saw the hotel, wished we had actually spent a few days here. Next time......and there WILL be a next time as we didn't get to see the whole theme park, nor get to the water playground. Be prepared for 1 3/4 hour trip due to customs if you go by the bus linked to the site. AND make sure you book the bus in advance as their website doesn't cater for next day trips......we had to visit the head office near the Singapore Flyer.It's not just a place for children to play, but for al Lego enthusiasts and inner children we, like many people hide. I had so much fun.We took a lot of photos and I sat down to build a challenge set by other enthusiasts.Food outlets provide good food and there is plenty of shade...bring a poncho in case of rain.",5.0

1043,Wonderful stay,Its just for 2 days 1 night stay at the premium kingdom theme room. The mini treasure hunt provide excitement for both my teenage boy and his younger sister. Really appreciate the box of lego provided in the room. It helps to keep the young one busy when cooped up in the room. With a tv for each children and adult segment gave all of some entertainment whilst having our rest on our beds. The play area full of lego at the lobby really managed to occupy my active girl whilst I handle the administrative stuff at the counter. Nice variety of food spread for breakfast. Friendly staff making checking in and out a breeze and room was clean and cosy. My little girl especially loved staying here. ,5.0

1045,Went from Singapore on a day trip. Not crowded at all on a weekday. Fun for kids from 4 to 8 years. ,"Lovely fun filled theme park with lots of rides for the young ones. We went on a Tuesday from Singapore to Legoland johar Bahru with WTS coaches. The bus ride was very comfortable. WTS travels office is at Singapore flyer. They charged us 78 Singapore dollar per person for to and fro and theme park ticket included. The park was superb but it was very hot. Since it was not crowded at all. It was fun. Walk in at all rides. Cafeteria was nice too, good fresh food in vegetarian too.Only I wish they kept more Lego toys on sale. Dint find the heartlake city airport Lego there.",5.0
1046,good fun,"The technic was closed, a bit disappointing. Star Wars ride was fun but a bit scary for my 8 and 9 years old, the 12 and 13 year olds enjoyed it greatly. There were many rides that allow a range of ages, so good fun. The map did not help us find the places easily, just a few pointers quite a distance apart. Perhaps, arrows on the ground may help. We took the left turn to reach Star wars, after lunch we took the right turn and there were a lot more things to do in adventure land. The kids had a great time at the water park. But one thing was very annoying, the tables and chairs at the caf√© were 90% filled with bags, clothes etc. and hardly any place to eat.  People monopolized the tables but not to eat. There should be open shelves for those items, maybe too cheap to rent lockers or too far.",4.0
1047,Maintainence of the Poor,"2nd visit after 2015. The park started show in poor condition. Some rides have closed, some in maintenance, some not function well (the water bomb), some put money but not work (remote control speed boat), Some Worker look boring as maybe not much people playing at their care attraction... Overall the condition of the park significant in poor condition compare to 1st trip 2 years ago....",3.0
1048,Great for young children,"My son and I visited for his 3rd birthday last weekend. He enjoyed it so much that he didn't want to leave. We stayed from 12PM-5PM on a Sunday. It wasn't crowded so we didn't wait for more than 5 minutes for any ride. I think he was able to go on 5 rides that allowed below 4 yo to enter. Aside from the rides, there were outdoor playgrounds and Lego-building centers. Our tickets don't allow us to go out and come back in so we had to eat inside the park. The food was ok; we spent about MYR50 for both our meals-pizza and pasta at Pizza Mania. Bathrooms are clean but has a ""public toilet"" smell. ",5.0

1050,Old and not totally fun ,"Definitely not enticing to the older kiddos or adults. Possibly could still pass little kiddos of ours at age 5+ and 3+. It was our first visit and we got the annual passes in hope of repeated visits. Sadly, it is quite obvious needs upgrading/revamp. Few of the rides were a joke - too short of duration, to name one I remembered the 'wave rider' was the funniest/shortest we encountered - it felt like a blink, it took us one round and before i could react it stopped, I tell myself maybe it was approaching closing. Probably we went at not a good time, there were 2 sites undergoing maintenance, though they did took an effort to inform upon entrance. Found another site under maintenance when we get in. So 3 sites down which is quite a disappointment.  The food was acceptable at the Asian Deli. The other common theme park food were just typical standard. As far as i remembered we have 3 encounters of food out of stock during this trip. 1st was the wanton noodle at the theme park, 2nd was the Cantonese hor fun at the hotel in room menu, and lastly (not relating to legoland) the chicken mushroom noodle at the chicken restaurant at the mall of Medini.

1054,Great place for kids,"Spent two nights at Legoland travelling over from Singapore.   Kids had a great time.   Great 'themed' rooms with a king size bed for the adults and bunks for the kids.   Very good breakfast included.   Bought a two day theme park pass which was adequate.   We were fortunate as travelling in October we missed the crowds and the parks were very quiet allowing the kids to have unlimited rides without waiting.   Did both the theme park one day and the water park the next.   Both parks well run, plenty of pleasant obliging staff and the prices quite reasonable (cheap compared to Disneyland/Australian theme parks).   Well worth a visit if you have kids under about 14/15.",5.0

1056,Good indoor exhibitions and performances. Poorly maintained outdoor deco and exhibits.,"I went to Legoland 3 years ago and was mesmerized by the cheerful colors and deco. I recently went again and was surprised that the same place has now become dull and poorly maintained. The outdoor lego exhibits and statues look faded and dirty. The Lego city train audio sounded muffled. Legoland needs urgent refurbishment and maintenance.You can easily tell the difference between the new areas (Ninjago and Starwars) and the old ones. However, the Ninjago show was awesome and entertaining. The use of puppetry, image effects and storyline keeps me engaged and worth the ticket price.",3.0
1057,Place for children ,"This place is boring to visit for adults, especially if you are alone. Worth to go with children, they have to like it. I was first time in Legoland, so for me was interesting to see architecture of Asia made of lego. Also i went to few attractions. The last was Nindziago, you need to put on 3d glasses, then sit in train and start to take a part in 3d game - fighting with bad guys. After you can see how many points you received.",3.0

The rides were ok, some of the activities for kids were good. Though, my expectations were higher compared to Universal Studios in Singapore. This place is average comparatively. The options for vegetarians is only the Pizza Mania, we also requested the chef to make us a veggie pasta which he obliged.",3.0

1062,A dreamland for young children ,"Lived up to our expectations for a child friendly adventure. Not suitable for children 11 and up as there is a limited number of attractions that would hold their attention. However for young children ages 3-11, this is a perfect theme park. The shows were creative and entertaining. The rides were appropriate. The size of the park is just right for children as well.  The Lego Miniland is extraordinary. The food was average and a little pricey for the quality. There are not many shaded areas, so wear a hat or bring an umbrella to block the sun. ",4.0

1066,Amazing theme park for brick-lovers and families!,"If you are a super fan of the bricks since childhood, Legoland is definitely an ideal place for you. At the Legoland, you can see the beauty of details and creativity, e.g. you can see a collection of almost all the famous architecture in Asia made by Lego (took more than 3 years to complete!) and there are buttons on each architecture which can display songs/dances. And near each cartoon statue, there's a tag of the basic information of this statue, including how many bricks and how long does it take etc. Highly recommend to plan 4-5 hours in the park to fully experience the wonder of every tiny bricks.:)",5.0
1067,Excellent displays and good rids,"First time to a legoland and enjoyed the experience immensely.  It was a very happy place to be and everyone was kind and helpful. Stayed in legoland hotel - got half hour early entrance so well worth it. The X ride was not working (upgrading it we were told).Rides good for my child who is 8 years old, but maybe over 10 wouldn't have so much fun if they liked thrilling rides. We enjoyed Rollercoaster in Kingdom and Dino Splash.  Some other rides were a bit lame to me (Njango, Pharoes). Great day out and only needed one day as it was very quiet. ",4.0
1068,Disappointed 3rd visit to Legoland Malaysia,"This was my 3rd visit to Legoland Malaysia and I am extremely disappointed. Nothing looks appealing anymore. The merchandise are overprice and there's nothing new about it. The ticket is only for one time entrance only even though it stated as OPEN on the ticket. Clearly few staffs are not trained on customer service etiquette. The only consolation was that I didn't have to queue long for the rides (roller coaster) as it was a Friday.C'mon LEGOLAND MALAYSIA, you're only 5 years old and the place looks dull!",1.0
1069,Many rides for young children,"My boy who is aged 4 has lots of fun at Legoland. There are many rides which are suitable for young children to ride. There is an area for toddlers to play too for kids who are too young to take the rides. In the theme park, there are a number of cafes for you to choose from. The only downside is that when it rains, you will have to wait for the rain to be over since alot of rides are in the open. I'll definitely recommend for parents to bring their kids here. And book the Legoland hotel if your kid still needs his/her afternoon nap.",5.0
1070,Legoland on Asia Pacific Doorstep worth a visit,"We read reviews all saying LEGOland was worth visiting and lots of fun and booked to go. A few days before, someone who had been said it was not very good and we started to get cold feet and think we had wasted our money BUT the reviews were right - It was Great! It is 5 years old now and although the colour in the lego has been affected by the weather the quality of the LEGO in miniland and throughout the attractions was excellent. We loved the short rollercoaster and Indiana Jones shooting. The new Ninjago laser ride was heaps of fun (and a workout!) and the star wars lego exhibit very extensive. But the Ninjago puppet show was the best. Very original and great for kids who had seen all the Ninjago DVD's growing up. We went on a Tuesday and it was not crowed, the most we waited for a ride was 3 turns ahead. We were disappointed that LEGO driving school was for 13 and under as we all wanted to drive LEGO cars!Things to be aware of - it rains here, then it is full sun, hot and steaming all in the same hour so you need umbrellas and a plan for when it pours as all the rides shut. There are heaps of indoor things to do but you have to know were to go. Food in the park was OK quality for fast food and not too expensive compare to other parks we have been too. Bring water or buy water $3RM a bottle. There is shade (we were told there was none) and lots of rides you get wet on to cool down. The $10RM body dryer was worth it after we got soaked! Even though it is not on the same level as Disneyland, it was well worth  the visit for teenagers who grew up with lego and adults who are really just big kids at heart. We had a great day.",4.0
1071,Truly wonderful memorable stay,"From the moment we arrived at Legoland Hotel was impeccable.Check in was quick. Kids were able to play with lego whilst parents at check in. Everything was explained to us regarding our stay and hotel & parks activities.Our suite room was large, clean and had a great view of theme park.We had breakfast in the bricks restaurant which had a good selection of food.The pool area (although we didn't use it) looked fabulous with lego in it, we wish we had have had longer to take advantage of this.With the room package we were given free additional day pass to theme park & waterpark. This was very helpful and allowed us to make best use of our short trip.The small touches made our stay truly special, our 4 & 6 years old loved their surprise treasure!I couldn't rate this hotel highly enough, true 5 star.Many thanks for a memorable stay.",5.0
1072,great place to spend your weekends,"We subscribed to annual premium pass during the previous promotion in 2016, so we could come again and again during school holidays & weekends. honestly, I prefer to come during weekdays because of less crowd, less waiting time. The food is good especially their bread pudding (get it from the first cafe from the entrance).",5.0
1073,There's always something new there,"Third time visiting this place. Last time was just last year 2016. Newest attraction this time is the Ninjago section. The theater is fun for the kids but adults is less likely. The Ninjago ride is better though. Other rides are more or less the same if you been there a couple of time. The LEGO exhibit outside got a few additional changes since the last time I was there. Go as a group to enjoy all that is there. Currently there's a major construction in front of the main entrance, so it's hard to get a full picture of the iconic entrance. Staffs are mostly friendly & helpful to inform us when a show or parade is on.",4.0
1074,Great fun for youngsters,"Legoland Malaysia is a fantastic day out particularly for people with children under 10.It isn‚Äôt cheap to get in although you can get a lower price through Klook instead of paying at the gate. If you buy a combo for the water park and theme park you will find the with a whole day both are doable, but if you can have two days it would be better.The staff are without exception polite, friendly and helpful and the rides, attractions and general maintenance are of a high standard. The rides tend towards younger visitors so don‚Äôt come here if you are some sort of adrenaline junky.That said I had loads of fun.Being a week day (Monday) we didn‚Äôt have to queue at all for any rides or slides in the water park. I can imagine it would be hell when it is busy.Food and drinks are very expensive by local standards, but reasonable by Western standards. There are plenty of outlets.Obviously there are plenty of opportunities to but LEGO and LEGO associated items.We drove here from within Malaysia and I think with free parking at the hotel it might be the beat way to get here.Overall the park is highly recommended.",4.0

1076,"Amazing time in Legoland, Malaysia","It was a great visit with so many things to do! The park operating hour is 10am but we arrived early at 9am so we could take the time to see the area. The management of the park organised some activities incl. aerobic for the early birds while waiting for the park to open. What a thoughtful thoughts! Since our last visit in 2016, there have been a number of upgrades, particularly to the dry park and the kids love them all. We did not see much changes to the wet park, maybe the management may want to do some upgrade to the wet park. In terms of food, we found that there were not much choices & quite pricey too, but overall, a day well spent in LEGOLAND.",5.0

1078,The Ultimate location for kids to spend a short vacation,"We visited Legoland during the 1st week of September(7th & 8th) and purposely avoided the weekend rush. While we do the check-in formalities, the kids can start playing out with the Lego toys in the lounge area. The lifts are disco-themed lights with ABBA songs being played out as soon as you enter the lift. Once you enter the room, there is some treasure hunt activity for the kids to do. The kids will enjoy the Buffet dinner at the hotel as well.  The theme park is more or less suited for kids between 5 to 12 as most of the rides & activities are catered to that age group.Please ensure that you do carry around an umbrella as well as raincoat.",5.0
1079,"The kids will enjoy it, not much for toddlers","We visited Legoland, 2 families with 5 kids combined (11,10,8,7,2). Unfortunately we had a thunderstorm on the day that shut the rides down for a few hours, but there is not really much there anyway. It was quiet when we were there, so no lines which was good as I'd have been disappointed waiting for what are pretty basic rides. Its a bit of a pain getting there as you have to go through boarder control out and in to Singapore that can take a while. There is very little to do for children under 3 years old.I wouldn't classify this as a must do, but I'm glad we did go. The older kids did enjoy themselves, but if there wasn't rain we could have got through everything in about 3 hours. The staff are friendly and the food is standard theme park, average and expensive.",3.0
1080,A good day,"Lovely visit, mascot walked around the Pizza restaurant at lunch time n we were able to get photos with him. Lots of mosquitoes at the park so remember to bring repellent. The water park doesn't allow phones (even in clear waterproof pouches/watches/sunglasses) on slides...so basically put everything in the locker. Virtually no queues. Lovely place. ",4.0
1081,On the brink??? ,"Sad, bordering farcical experience with all 3 flagship rides closed in the theme park and 3 of 8 water slides closed in the water park. Considering it was a weekend you would have expected the full experience. There was no queues as there was very little footfall at the parks, perhaps the maintenance issues are due to a lack of funds? It made for a bizarre experience. On the plus side the hotel was impressive with a fun ""kingdom room"". We paid 1600 (Malay) for one night b&b and unlimited access the both parks over two days- IF all the rides were working it would have been value but sadly this was not the case. ",2.0
1082,Noise! Colour! Sugar!,"We spent 2 nights here at the end of a week long trip to Singapore. Our 7 year old gave it 20/10 but our 3 teens were not too interested. The hotel is expensive but pretty amazing in terms of colours, decor and sounds. The lifts even have a disco ball and abba music! The themed rooms were really cool although beds as hard as nails so we didn't sleep well. The buffet dinner was a highlight for the kids, with table cloths that can be coloured in, and cupcake decorating as an activity. Very expensive though. The theme parks were ok but more geared to small kids. Our 7 year old was on it until closing and absolutely loved it, but the teenagers got bored. The waterpark rides are pretty tame and suitable for small kids. The second day we went though most of them were closed which was a disappointment. We caught a maxi taxi here from Singapore which cost $150; the going rate is $200 so see if you can negotiate. Also if travelling from Singapore, leave no later than 730am or risk Being stuck for 3 hours at the customs gates. Overall it was a highlight of the trip just to see the sense of wonder and excitement in our 7 year old! She basically said it was the best day of her life. ",4.0
1083,Fun if it's your first theme park,"My family and I stayed at the Legoland hotel for one night and spent one day at the water park and one day at the Legoland park. The water park was incredible. We all had such fun with all the slides, rafts and tubes. Highly recommended for a worthwhile fun wet visit. You can hire towels (expensive) and lockers for your belongings. We get most of our clothes, sunblock, shoes etc on a chair and it was fine. The Legoland hotel is fun for the little ones as there is lego everywhere for them to build and create. We were lucky enough to be upgraded to the premium room where there is lego in a safe that you need to figure out the combination to open it. That was fun for all of us to figure out the cryptic clues all over the room. The room was fine, but it is getting tired and I think they should freshen them up if they continue to charge what they do. We had dinner at the Italian which was surprisingly very good. The breakfast buffet on the other hand was shocking. Plastic, processed, inedible, fatty, tasteless food. Toast & fruit is probably the safest to eat. The breakfasts I have had in deepest darkest Africa have been better.... The budget should definitely be relooked at for the buffets. But they do cater for all kids needs i.e. Plastic plates and glasses in different colours which is fun for them. Pity we couldn't really fill the plates! The Legoland theme park itself is awesome if it's your first time to a theme park. Some of the rides rules regarding height and age make no sense e.g. My 4 yr old could not go on the very gentle ""spinning cups"" type ride but was allowed to go on the rollercoaster - twice.  There are a lot of extra games that you need to pay more for which was a little annoying. At the end of the day my kids had fun but I would rather do Disneyland in HK. ",3.0
1084,Awesome and great staff ,"Compared with 3 years ago, the theme park had improved a lot. Now, built with many facilities that allow visitor to rest and cool down.

Completely unsuitable for babies below 3, in which, ring floats with seats are more suitable for these age groups.I have lodged a complaint, however they insist, their rule is most relevant though very inconvenient for us parents bringing our babies here. Baby head cant be kept above water even for half a second with their life vests and they expect if the baby cannot be accomodated with their life vests then we shud just hold our babies.No comsideration for baby neck floats or bottom ring floats that are even used in hippopo baby spa.

A couple of the rides were down for maintenance.All in all though the kids had a good day.",4.0
1090,Need improvement,"Been there with my 4 y/o child. Actually she loves it since the rides were mostly dedicated for kids. However the closing time 6.30 pm was way too early, other themeparks usually closed around 8 pm.The rides itself need some improvement here and there. Many of them already worn out. Legoland needs to make some improvement to maintain seriously. Meanwhile, outside Legoland was nothing. No shoping center, no markets or other attraction. Just Legoland hotel and waterpark. I will think twice to return again, unless there are any new attractions that worth to visit. ",3.0
1091,Exhibits looking worn and broken - lack of general upkeep throughout the park,"We have had a long history of this place as having visited about 8 times in the last 5 years. We have just returned from what will be our last visit as the upkeep on this place and the marketing of the event (The 5th Birthday sale) was very poor. This is a multinational organisation theme park, and its upkeep is not good. We first visited in the first month it opened and expected some teething issues. Each time we have returned to similar, if not worse situations of rides, or general upkeep. The first time I think may have been enough, but then the water park opened and we had to see that also with kids. This too has seen better days now.Many of the key big ticket exhibits are not bee kept to the level which you expect from major names like Star Wars. The disappointment in seeing the light-sabres broken off the exhibits features of a battle where the figures are fighting it stumps doesn't bring awe and excitement, just disappointment in a few 10-year-olds. The mini Legoland has mould and the feature exhibitions are just poorly kept with an automatic bus roaming the streets of an exhibit with a broken front end and on a lean as no one has fixed it in a year and a half since we went there last. This is typical of many of the exhibits. Boats in the water features surrounding the main exhibition pieces full of water or half submerged due to little attention to upkeep. Figures lying on their sides, and have been for some time. Buttons that don't 'do' anything anymore.These sorts of things should be managed daily as part of upkeep.As to the rides, it is an expectation that the rides are out of order now as we have been so many times and rides are out of action. Never have we been when one ride is not under repair, out of action for the day, or just mysteriously 'not working.' One aspect of the promotional materials which we received when entering the park was a scratchy ticket that gave us 30% off photo purchases; we didn't get it even though we purchased a photo product. Not even in the small print does it mention that it is only one form of photo and that it has to be from a specific booth and you can't have the one you wanted for the ride because you pay for it at the ride, the collect it at 'the shop'...... Very poor communication to the sales team who just bluntly refused to see that their promotional material is misleading. We discussed it with the Customer Service staff also as a point of interest who just plainly blocked our suggestion that this would be better positioned as a single product advice rather than 'Photo Purchases""We were staying at the Legoland Hotel as the main attraction of our visit for our now 10 year old boys and this was the highlight of the trip, not the park. Although the hotel still needs to address what appears to be a concern for food intolerances, nothing is in place to address their needs even when given advance notice, but that's another review....My overall opinion of this place now is that it is like many of the Malaysian attractions. They are great at the start, but lack the upkeep to maintain the standard of the attraction. These places should be packed with tourists, but we had no waits, no delays, and no problems getting onto rides that were suitable for the boys. I think they loved it still, but for a parent paying big dollars for this sort of thing in the Lego shops, it's not been invested back into the attractions. Be prepared for stuff to not be working properly.Stuff in the shop is no better prices than in Singapore either.",2.0
1092,Dont Buy Ticket on-line,"Before leaving home, I bought a tickets for my family and cost me around AU$300. Upon arrival in LEGOLAND it was raining and everyone is excited. I approached the counter and advised me that some of uncover area is closed and the water park is closed. I explained to the manager that we are from far away. The manager advised that if we don't use it we lose all the tickets and need to buy another one. The manage they us another option that we can go on-line and another fee will be charge for changing date. I requested if they can stamp the ticket so we can comeback the next day. The manager insist if we don't go we lose out ticket. But explained to the manager it was raining and their decision to close the park. But yeah they insisted not to do anything to our ticket. So waited to stop the rain also most all day. The park is over rated and minimal attraction for the children's. The way they treated their customer from far away is not good enough. Everything is there its all about money. Only one attraction they should be great in their customer service. The place is run down. The toys are almost can see the dirt and the stain in the Lego blocks. The toilet is too dirty.Very disappointed and not worth what you paid.",1.0

1097,Charmless and horrible,This is a very poor copy of Legolands elsewhere in the world.  If at all possible you should visit one of the other Legolands.The ticket office is blatantly dishonest advising that online tickets must be bought 3 days in advance.  This simply isn't the case.  The online tickets are of course much cheaper.The staff appear genuinely depressed which adds to the general gloominess of the place.Don't visit Johor Bahru just to visit this place.

1100,Delights everytime,"We visited once in December 2012 and once in March 2017. We were delighted on both occasions. For the first visit, we covered Miniland and almost all of the roller coaster rides. The Miniland is amazing with all its details while the rides are mild yet exciting, perfect for our 4 year-old daughter then. During the second trip this year (with our kids aged 8, 4 and 8-month-old) we had plenty of fun too. Even though it rained for quite a while and we were ""trapped"" mainly in the Ninjago 4D section, we enjoyed and took the Ninjago ride several times. After the rain cleared, we took a few simple carnival rides, did some firefighting and went to the Driving School. Overall, this is a place that caters well for the young and young-at-heart. There's something for everyone (except for those aged below 1) and I'm already planning a third trip for my youngest child.",5.0

1102,"Surprisingly Good, very clean and worth a visit.","We visited Legoland here in Johor Bahru at the end of August 2017. We were staying in Johor Bahru and simply caught a bus at the Larkin Terminal which took us directly there. We visited during the week and arrived just as it opened. It was actually quite empty and remained so throughout the day. There were practically no queues for all of the rides; we managed to do them all twice and some we even did three times. Legoland itself was very clean and the staff there were very friendly and approachable. Although it's not the biggest theme park, it's still a good size with a nice variety of attractions/rides for the whole family. The driving school in particular was a favorite with our two youngest children.The fact the park was so empty made it even more special because it allowed us the opportunity to do all the rides without having to wait no more than 4 or 5 minutes. There is a nice place to eat, some shops and the toilets were always being cleaned. Everytime I visited the toilet there was someone either cleaning or just finishing cleaning. I would recommend a visit to this park if you're in the area, especially so during the week when it's far less busy. We had a great time.",4.0
1103,Legoland Theme Park visit,"Legoland Gelang Patah / Johor BahruVisited this theme park with family and kid, was raining but my opinion it's quite good theme park.A lot of games and rides, half dat won't be enough to play all the games and rides.So make sure you have whole day just for the Theme Park..We missed the water park, because we didn't have enough time in Johor Bahru.Would visit theme park and Water Park on the second day in the future.Thanks so much",4.0
1104,Best!,"Very fun place. Everything is top quality. My 6 year old boy had a blast, as he was just tall enough to go on all the rides they had to offer. They could offer some more halthy/vegetarian/vegan options in the restaurants. Other than that, our trip couldn't have been better! ",5.0
1105,Average ,"The car park to Legoland makes you think that this theme park is old and deserted. After a walk you suddenly find yourself at the front gate. Upon buying tickets, the woman did not believe our daughter was 3 and demanded a passport which we hadn't brought with us. We were forced to buy her a child's ticket which annoyed me because once inside, since she is so little, she couldn't go on a lot of the rides. But yet we had been forced to buy her a child's ticket only for her to miss out on a lot of rides. I'd expect Legoland to have the same atmosphere as the one in America, but this park just didn't have any sort of vibe at all! It was quiet when we went, but it was really quite boring. Granted there is always something to do while waiting for your older kids to get off rides, and there are buildings with air conditioning which provide a welcome relief from the beat! Our 5 kids had fun, but it didn't compare to a day out at Universal Studios in Singapore.",3.0
1106,for kids and young at heart,"great for kids and young at heart, should expect to spend the whole day here. check on their website to get a good deal on their tickets.",5.0
1107,Love the giant fans around the park,"It was scorching hot the day we visited, but the giant fans placed at strategic locations around the park made up for it. There was welcoming gush of cool air every now and then. The queues were generally manageable (can't say they move fast, but everything was in good order, and you just need to be patient for some of the rides, just like Universal Studios Singapore). My kids (2yo and 4yo) had fun running around the big space, and the elder one utterly enjoyed himself on the few rides he tried. We only visited the main park and we left around evening time (reached about 11am). It was a good trip.",5.0
1108,Fun but could use a little more shad,"Could really use more shad since it's always hot in Malaysia, the playground equipment were so hot that can cause damaging burnt. But in overall a fun place to be and would come back again when my kid is little older!",4.0
1109,Great day out,"I would recommend this place to families with young children, as they'd have the most fun. The theme park itself is great, plenty to see, eat and do. The park offers a variety of rides and all the different sections are executed wonderfully. My 9 year old daughter was quite pleased with everything and my husband was in awe of the lego built towns and cities. Though I will say the entry tickets are a little pricey",4.0
1110,First visit to Legoland,"If you've not been to legoland and you have kids below 8 years old, a visit is a must. My daughter had fun in legoland. Lego city was great with the cars, the train, the fire-engine, etc. My only grouse is that its very hot since JB is tropical and the sun will be hot. The heat tires people out. I'm not sure if the lego sets will last in the sun. Minimally, i felt Lego City and Mini Land should be in an air-con dome. The train should move within an air-con dome. We were also quite disappointed that the ninjago ride was totally not working. Staff put a maintenance sign and told us they needed time to fix it. We checked from 12pm till 5pm and it was still not working.",4.0

1113,Family Trip was amazing,"We stayed here for one night only just to experience the themed hotel, expensive but its all worth it!! My kids really had fun with the hotel facilities! We love the elevator which everytime we take going up and down, we will shout ""party in the elevator"" and dance! In the night after our dinner in Kai's sushi bar , we went to lobby and were so entertain with the dancing pirates! Kids are dancing with them and even invites the parents too, legoland was really good for a family trip and bonding!! We will definitely come back in the future,,, ",5.0
1114,Wonderful stay with kids,"We travelled as 3 adults with our 2 young grandchildren.  This was perfect!  The room was amazing complete with treasure chest for the kids.  It was so clean and had everything we could possibiliby need, the housekeeper on floor 7 was so friendly and helpful she should be commended on her peoples skills.  The restaurant is so child friendly it was heaven for them.  The parks were idle and fun.  The lift even had a disco playing, the foyer had a big screen kids dance showing and lego play areas everywhere.  This is certainly the best child accommodation I have ever seen.  The only negative was we paid for an early checkin and after 3 attempts finally was given our room, mid afternoon.  The reception attendant did personally find us and give us the key which was amazing customer service, however paying for an early checkin is a waste of money.  I definately would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to gve there kids the stay of a lifetime.",5.0

1116,Fun place for the kiddo ,"You can buy the ticket online and get it verify with Mykad upon entering. We went for the dry park, which consists of 7 theme park. One day itself is not enough, need at least 2 days. It's a hot day. Bring your cap or umbrella. Car park is far walking distance. Most of the ride require kid to be 6yo or 100cm above. There is restaurant in most of the theme park which varieties of western and Asian foods. You can't bring your own food except plain water. Toilets are clean. Expect to queue during holidays but we spent less than 30mins so still acceptable. ",4.0
1117,Perfect combination of resort and theme park for kids of all ages!,"Our family, including an 8 and 7 year old had a great couple of days at Legoland. Our 8 year old son loved the Dragon roller coaster. The Lego displays were great. Our 6 year old daughter loved the Ninjago ride and the water park. We all really enjoyed the master builder workshops, which were very professionally run.We went on a Wednesday and stayed over night (during the mid-year Aust school holidays), so we found that there were no queues at all for any rides. It was hot walking around but the shows and some of the rides were indoors so we were able to escape the heat.The themed hotel was excellent, and the kids were excited with the in room treasure hunt.The hotel and 2 day them park passes were definitely cheaper booked in advance. So I would highly recommend you book at least 7 days before you go. And it was only a 45min drive, in a private transfer, from Singapore CBD.",4.0
1118,Depends..,"Depends on your kids age n heights... not much ride my 3yo gal who was a small sized couldn't take some rides. But if you're going, NiNjaGo adventure rides is a must go!! Very very fun!!! It will located inside the NinjaGo red temple!!",4.0
1119,Enjoyable ,"Legoland has opened its doors a few years now but thankfully the property, rides and facilities remain well maintained. At the time of visit the queue to most rides was manageable and the weather was not overwhelming. Take note that the park is mostly unsheltered so going during heavy rain or intense heat will require some preparation otherwise it will be quite unpleasant for both adults and young children. The attractions continue to be upgraded and introduced so still worth visiting more than once. The park has enough eateries as rest points, unless you have young infants, it may not be necessary to stay in nearby Legoland Hotel. Well worth a visit particularly for younger children, most rides permit children with height above 120cm.",5.0
1120,Probably one of the better theme parks,"Now, if you have children below 12, that would make this theme park great. Most theme parks caters to adults and teenagers but here children between 3 and 12 would thoroughly enjoy themselves as most rides are designed for them. A must go if you have young children.",4.0

1122,Suitable for pre schoolers,"Took my 6 & 4 yo there during the school holiday. It was a good introductory theme park for preschoolers I would say. Park is well maintained however in a tropical country like Malaysia where the Sun is always scorching hot, you ought to have more shades in an outdoor park like this. Even with a shaded stroller, kids could get toasted. Other than that, kids had a lot of fun. Staff were friendly and helpful despite the language barrier with foreign staff as some didn't seem to speak much English. ",4.0
1123,Surprise Trip making an 8 Year old boy very happy!,"We told our son who had been asking to go to LEGOLAND for months now that we were going to Johor and would be visiting the Museums there, he was happy but still sad he would not get his wish.  As we approached LEGOLAND he saw a sign and asked if the museum was here as well, we only let him into the secret when he was out of the car and still asking why we had not bought tickets for him, we passed him the tickets and the fun started from there!2 Days in the Water and Attraction Park, what a great time, we did every ride apart from two which were deemed too scary by our now professional 8 year old tour guide :-)Fantastic facilities, clean and well maintained throughout, the staff there were helpful and always smiling, it is a kids park but hey, the adults can enjoy too! Well worth the cost as sadly it is not cheap",5.0
1124,Could still be better ..... untapped potential,"Brought the family to Legoland on 4 September 2017 to both the wet and dry parks. Overall, it was an ok experience although they could still do a lot more in making the place cooler or shaded in between attractions as it was just way too hot. Some suggestions - have a relook at your height / age ride restrictions. Some rides have a height restriction of 100cm + age restriction of 6 years old (Wave Racers) and another 110cm + 4 years old (Technic Twister). My older boy is above 100cm and 5 years old and guess what, he couldn't sit on either ride which is disappointing and seriously, stupid, because if you compare the 2 rides, 110cm/6 years old and 100cm/4 years old, what's the correlation? Did someone actually think through before putting up such restrictions??As for the water park, I really think that some of the equipment needs some maintenance especially the Lego bricks in the Build-a-Raft River.Moreover, I thought that the park was generally supposed to be smoke-free but everytime I went to the toilets, guess what, there are people smoking somewhere.Food-wise has improved since I was last year but could still be improved and the pricing could really be relooked at because some of the food can be really expensive for the quality / quantity.",3.0

1130,Great visit to nearby legoland Malaysia!,"I only went to the legoland theme park and not the water park. My kid (being 2 years old) wouldn't have benefited from going to the water park anyway.- no outside food allowed into the theme park! I'm serious! They stationed freaking security officers outside that checked our bags (I thought it was for guns or bombs) but were confiscating bread, chips or even homemade sandwiches from all the patrons! They seriously goto review this stupid policy.- couldn't find ice cream vendors in the theme park. For the hot weather I thought they should really think this is a good idea. The only vendor we finally found ran out of the usual ice cream flavours and only had mango. Right.... for a 2 year old... who usually likes chocolate or vanilla... - no sale of cotton candy or cute cold drinks.- no water coolers around. So keep spending money and buying water if u need. - family rooms usually located around the restaurants and eateries. But beware there's usually a queue. N if ure a breastfeeding mum, tough luck! No visible nursing room! Jus sit n nurse with a nursing cover where ever u r. Really! Don't do it in the family room cos it's quite dirty.- check the rides for the height or age limits before queueing. My 2 year old couldn't sit on the thrill rides.- show schedules were not published online or even in the brochures. We r supposed to walk around and look at the sign boards directly outside the show areas for the show timings.- meet and greet characters had no known timing or venues published. I couldn't find info on this anywhere! Not even from the information counter. Wahaha.- by a stroke of luck I managed to catch the ninjago meet and greet character, the ninjago show time which was just nice after our lunch and right outside the market restaurant. Also managed to catch the star wars character dance. It's at 4pm. Some guy or lady will be shouting it few minutes before to remind ppl they r coming.- there were thankfully still many rides for a toddler to take so she had a lot of fun n things to see and do!  Definitely a theme park for kids of all ages.",3.0
1131,Great Park for Under-10s,"Very nice, orderly and clean park.  I was at the water park this time.  Tried the Gazebo facilities which was excellent.  Like the dry park (tried that last year), this amusement park is most suitable for under 10s.  It's not very big and can be covered in one morning.  Food is expensive as expected but very good. Great place to let the little ones run free.  The ""Build a Raft"" river is a must try for Lego fans.",4.0

We enjoyed the floating in the lazy river, had fun at the big water playground and then followed by having the thrilling rides at the various slides, such as Red Rush, Brick Blasters and Splash & Swirl. There was almost no queue and we could play and had fun for many times.We went for lunch at about 12noon. After that, we continued with the Theme Park. Again we had lots of fun there. The waiting time for rides was mostly 5 min. We enjoyed ourselves a lot. As we bought the 2 Day combi tickets, we went to the 2 parks the next day.

1137,A great and memorable experience for all of us.,"We missed the great entrance of legoland with the big LEGOLAND sign on it since there is an on-going construction right in front of the park. To compensate, they placed a nice backsrop beside the main entrance for picture taking.We were welcomed inside even though the park was not open yet. While waiting there are Lego mascots and dance routine to entertain all early park guests.There are new rides added in the park. The new Ninjago ride was so much fun for all of us.What was really fun and exciting is that the park was made for small or younger children unloke other themed park. My kids were 115 and 120cm tall and we were able to ride even the extrme Project X ride (roller coaster)The food selection is wide and the proportion is great for sharing.The park accepts both RM and SGD (as most tourist comes from Singapore)  as currency but the change will only be RM. Not to worry, for RM loose change you can always buy snacks and small souvenirs from the nearby mall.We enjoyed our experience both in Legoland Park and Water Park.We are surely going back especially after 2018 when the Sea Life opens.Thank you Legoland",4.0
1138,a must for lego fans! ,"Went for the theme park only as my daughter  has not reached the minimum height for most rides. We were lucky that weather was good on the day we were there. Crowds was also not to its maximum capacity as average queue was at 15-20minutes. My daughter loved the duplo playground, the observation deck, boating ride and the train ride. The lego miniland was also impressive despite being able to withstand our harsh weather of sun and rain. There are ample place for kids to either run around and enjoy the rides or opt to sit down and just play with their lego bricks.However at times during peak hours rides  can be closed temporarily for maintenance which can cause disappointment.Food is pricey and mediocre which is typical for a theme park. Service from the staffs was pleasant and accommodating. Toilet cleanliness was superb - totally clean which was a BIG surprise to me as where our general public toilet hygiene level is quite poor.

Please come with lots of sunblock, hat, umbrella and keep yourself hydrated at all times.The dry theme park is spacious and nicely laid out with activities, shows and rides for kids of all ages, as well as adults. Plenty of indoor rides too, which is a great respite from the heat. Going on a weekday was a good decision as there were no queues for the rides. The restaurants too were not crowded, but only two outlets are air-conditioned (one at the entrance and one pizza place at the Imagination section). At the pizza restaurant, we heard the staff loudly bad-mouthing some visitors of different nationality who did not understand English/Malay; we felt that was in very bad taste. The water park is not very big but with a variety of slides for the older guests, and pools for younger kids. There are cabanas available for rent (RM300 each), otherwise there are not many deck chairs for families to sit on. All in all, an excellent, hot day out with the family! At this moment, it's probably not a great idea to stay at the Lego Hotel as there is some big construction happening right outside, and the piling and drilling sound is really unbearable. ",4.0
1148,Great fun if your kids love Lego ,Our second visit of the year and my 5 and 7 year olds still have fun. The academy is great for signing up for classes for different age groups. ,4.0
1149,The best for now..!,"We had lots of fun visiting Legoland. Our favourite rides are The Dragon, Project X and Dragon's Apprentice. Its a great theme park for families with kids above minimum height for rides (check rides height requirement before visiting). Avoid weekends if possible and make sure to arrive early so that you have enough time to try all the rides and activities. F&B inside here is a bit exspensive. The management should hire more professionals to educate staff about the important of customer service and safety. There are some very good staff over here but most of them are not. Legoland is just 5 years old but we can see lots of defect around the theme park and attractions are not well mantained due to aging. Either the management really upgrade its services or be prepared to become like Sunway Lagoon, Times Square, Genting, etc. or maybe Mimaland. Will try the water park for our next visit. All da best Legoland..!",4.0
1150,favorite landmark,all of our family like lego. this is the first visit to legoland. we visit johor baru malaysia. everything we love it. kids singing lego theme and dance when gate opening. the only thing minus is. johor bahru is very hot. and less plants in legoland.,5.0
1151,funn but quite expensive,"for me, it is expensive but for most people it will not be that expensive...the price willbe around RM100-RM200 for both theme park...there are 4, i think roller coaster in here and the one that slide through the water is very nerve-wrecking! there are not many games for for small kids here though.",4.0
1152,nice!!,nice location and good service from the theme park. Just lack of some trees in the theme park. Will come again,5.0
1153,Pretty okay sadly it rained,Came to Legoland for the first time in 2016. Kids enjoyed it so much we decided to repeat it as day visitors. Sadly it rained cats and dogs. We still walked around the park but most of the rides were closed. Sadly we also didnt get to go to the water park which I believe is the best part. Pretty okay anyway. ,3.0
1154,Fun ,"Love the water slides and lazy river. Not so much on the thrill rides, which is fine for a faint heart like me. Highly recommended for families with young kids and teenagers, there's something for every age. But probably too tame for those looking for thrills & adrenaline rush. ",5.0
1155,Poor maintance maintenance,"The park is big, but no use of It, as main rides were out of service (on a weekend!), while there weren't many visitors. Park is only 5 years old but looks older, as it's not well kept. Very untidy, does not looks like world class amusement park at all. We were waiting for this visit since opening (as my kids were to little to visit). But it's wasn't a really great, extremely below expectations. ",2.0
1156,Awesome Waterpark!!!,It was indeed a memorable experience for my kids. They enjoyed all the water rides and activities. It was fun!!!,4.0
1157,Not a recommendable for teens and adults/,"Legoland was very small. Their rides are meant for children which means it's not really good for teens or adults. The only rides that I liked were Project X and the water slide. The dragon wasn't even scary. For me, it's just a waste of money. I recommend people to go to Universal Studios instead.",3.0
1158,Great waterpark but theme park was just okay,"We stayed 2 nights at the Legoland hotel, and visited both the water park and the theme park. Being hotel guests we were given early access to the parks and multiple entries which was great. The kids had more fun at the water park than they did the theme park, but that maybe partly due to the hot weather.  The lines at the theme park wasn't so bad, most of the time we only had to wait about 10-15 minutes. The water park was great, there were different pools and slides to choose from that cater children of all ages even adults. Unfortunately, in one of the afternoon when we were at the water park, there was a thunderstorm and they had to temporarily close all the pools and slides. Overall a great place to take the children and have fun.",4.0
1159,Fun water park ,Only went to water park. They were doing maintainance on the kids splash area so couldn't use it and they didn't tell us. Also if you go when thunder you can't use the water park and there is no refund. A good water park for 4+ year olds. The lazy river is nice and the boat racing is fun too. ,4.0
1160,Legoland,"Most rides in dry park caters for children, for those seeking trill rides will have limited choices. Lego fans will love the place. Weather is hot, unless cloudy, but there are places to hide from the sun, mainly cafes and places where you can get creative with legos. Babies are very well taken care of as there's a baby center for babies to sleep, get changed and fed comfortably. As for wet park, it could feel slightly more crowded because the area is smaller compared to dry park and many visitors love to get out of the heat by jumping into the water. Lockers available for rent thus convenient. Slides are limited in number. Perhaps we have been there too many times (we are annual pass holders for few years now) thus forgive my lack of excitement when reviewing this place.",3.0
1161,Put on your sunscreen! ,"It's recommeded to take both Waterpark & Themepark package & go for the Waterpark first. This is because the weather in JB is tend to rain in the evening. Have a big breakfast, play at waterpark, eat your lunch & go for Themepark. There's a lot of restaurants there u can choose or simply eat your tapau outside the park. Keep the area clean as you go. Don't mess with Johor!",5.0
1162,Great day at the theme park,Visited the theme park on a day that was not so crowded. All the staffs that we encountered with were very friendly! The rollercoaster rides were great but they should build better ones. It may be a kids theme park but they should at least cater to teenagers as well... ,4.0
1163,Great two days with fun,Visited the place twice during my stay in Johor. We spent one day at the water side and the second day on theme park.Kides enjoyed the place and had a lot of fun as went there during the weekdays so no much people were present. avoid during weekend.  ,4.0

1165,Great place to have fun with Kids!,We went to visit the park 2 days while we were on our holiday in Malaysia. Our 5 yrs boy enjoyed very much the theme park. Nice place for age 6+ because they can try all activities. It is quite hot but still enjoyable. ,5.0
1166,Awesome Family Theme Park - Love the new Ninjago Ride,"Visited Legoland on a Wednesday. The place wasn't packed and we didn't have to queue long for the rides so it was awesome. My kids had an awesome time going to the ride twice or thrice. Our only regret was not to have visited the water park too. One day is not enough, we should have spent one day at the park and another at the water park.",4.0
1167,Huge.........,"This theme park is really for kids...Kids would definitely enjoy it here.As for adults like me, just seeing your kids are enjoying make your experience fun as well...Kiddie rides fit me well coz I'm afraid of thrilling rides.

1168,Pretty good. Except weather too hot,"Brought my little one 5yrs to the new ninjago addition. The weather was so hot and not enough shades ard. The starwars display was quite a disappointment.. no more rides.Love the lego citycar ride. If u have maybank credit card, u can quote maybank promotion to get 30% off when u purhcase onsite. good deal",4.0
1169,Very enjoyable weekend but very pricey food,"This is our first time visiting Legoland Malaysia. We has visited one in Windsor many years ago. It takes us more than four years since Legoland Malaysia opened its door and we purposely delay our visits to avoid the crowd. Our plan turn out very well and visiting this place during off peak season really paid off. We enjoy the whole theme park almost by ourselves, there were hardly any long queue and we have tried all the rides and attraction. My daughter even enjoyed the Dragon Roller Coaster four times! She really enjoy herself. We also watched the show Lego 4D and Ninjago. Compare to other theme park shows we experienced before, both shows were a bit overrated. Maybe they need to improve the sound system. We hardly understand the storyline in both show.Our overall experience in the theme park were very enjoyable . All the rides were available except for the train which under maintenance. We also have chance to meet with Lego characters and enjoyed the character parade. However, we really regretted the food price at the theme park. I guess compare to other theme park the food price in Legoland Malaysia is very..very pricey. We had Chicken Rice which cost RM35 (USD8)! Considering the entry ticket which also a bit pricey RM150 (USD35) we hope Legoland Malaysia can consider to lower down the food price. We understand that price at major tourist attraction like this can be very pricey but NOT unreasonably pricey like.Regardless of this, we really had our most enjoyable time time and definitely will come again next time for the Water Park.",4.0
1170,Wonderful park,"We had an awesome day at Legoland with friendly staff, fun rides, miniatures and a great water park as well. We got the annual passes now, so we will be back!",4.0
1171,Awesome place,We had lots of fun and the park was quite enjoyable. The young children was very excited. Lego City part was  very impressive as was the Ninjago.We came in with few big lugagges and the staff were very helpful as to help us to store it. They even allowed me to use the ticket for re entry as I had to pick up the others from outside after storing the lugagges.It was quite bright and sunny and hot so make sure you are wearing your hat or use umbrella,5.0
1172,Legoland Malaysia - Kind of slow Theme Park,During my last trip to Malaysia - I decided to visit Legoland. I had seen some videos on YouTube about it. I was really interested in the miniature world more than anything. Here is my feedback:- It is located far from Airport. I was not in the mood to torture myself with 4 hours of bus ride from KL. So I hopped on an early AirAsia flight to Johor Bahru airport. It was a short flight about 45 mins long.- It is about 30 minutes of taxi ride from JB Airport to Legoland Malaysia- There are amazing photo ops during that 45 min ride- It is located beside the Medini Mall. Place looked deserted. There are few folks and weather was also very thuderstormy- It was a long wait at the ticket counter and they are not cheap - when you buy them on spot. I was only traveler so I had no challenges paying the full rack rate- It is moderately sized theme park. I think Genting Highland's out-door theme park is bigger than this - There two or three roller coaster rides - so if you are interested in that - than you better look somewhere else- Place is easily reachable from Singapore. There were a lot of families visiting from there- I loved the miniature land - there are some many things to check out and photos ops are stunning. I took a lot of photos- I had just started to explore the place - there came a short thunderstorm - it lasted for about 30 minutes. I had plenty of time - I arrived at the park around 09:45 AM. So no need to worry about the lost time- I had to purchase rain coat poncho at high-way robbery price of RM 18.00- I loved the model of temples and the KLIA the most- I saw only two places to eat - but I didn't get any food - I had some snacks that I had purchased at KLIA- I found this theme park to be little slow. There were a lot of people - but it seemed dead- Location is also kind of hard to reach with public transport- It is a place to visit with kids - not as adults alone,4.0
1173,Check the closed facilities at Website,"It's my first visit to the Water Park at late July.  However, the major water park facility - Joker Soaker is under a 3 weeks maintenance.   Without this fun place for children, the ticket price should have 30% discount.The Legoland MY is not as crowded as the other Theme Park, the queue time is short in general.  This is the great attraction of this park.",4.0

At least prepare healthy kids foods in the park or loosen the rule to bring in the light foods. Horrible experience.",1.0
1175,"Great family park, cheaper if you purchase tickets on line 7 days in advance","Our family, including an 8 and 7 year old had a great day at Legoland. Our 8 year old daughter loved the Dragon roller coaster. The Lego displays were great. Our 7 year old son loved the Ninjago ride. We all really enjoyed the Ninjago puppet show, which was very professionally done.We went on a Monday, so we found that there were no queues at all for any rides. It was hot walking around but the shows and some of the rides were indoors so we were able to escape the heat.The food prices were very reasonable, probably about half of the ridiculous prices that you'd pay at Australian theme parks (5 MYR or about A$1.50/S$1.50 for an ice cream, MR 3 for a bottle of water).",5.0
1176,Fun but...,We visited Legoland on our way from Singapore to Rawa Island for a day. Having visited the German Legoland a few years ago I was conscious of not comparing but it was difficult. To be honest the whole place was a bit tired. Outdoor attractions like mini land looked baked and a bit brittle. Rides were exciting and varied but oveall it lacked the theme park excitement and atmosphere. But...Our lego mad son really had a ball so a win still. Side note.....the Burger King just outide the gate was deplorable took over 40 min to order and get fed. Not a good end to the day.,3.0
1177,gret trip to Legoland,"Excellent trip for the family, kids need to be 4+ for a lot of rides, but our 2 year old still had fun. The park is built for the younger age, and the older teens may think it is too boring. Toilets are  not the easiest time find and need to be updated and cleaned more often. It would be nice to have more shade and rest areas. and allow the under 4 year old on more of the rides and areas to have some fun in.",4.0

If you have young kids, be prepared,it's a long wait. The park was great with some great attractions, the food on offer was really nice and inexpensive. The staff are all friendly and very courteous. The only downside I have is some of the displays need attention. They are sun affected and have blocks holding them up in places. Apart from that a really good day was had by all.",4.0
1182,Beyond expectations,"When we went to Legoland, we had no expectations on the park, as some friends said there's nothing to do there. We went just to complete our Asian theme park tours, and we had a great time! The activities are interactive and our youngest son enjoyed the experience..we went to all the rides and shows, and he missed the lego academy which is a great activity for developing young minds. If you are a Star Wars fan they have a special display showing all the famous scenes of all Star Wars movies, all in Lego bricks. Be sure to push the green buttons and you are in for a treat.As with all theme parks, food is expensive inside so have your brunch at Medini Mall right before the entrance to Legoland. There's KFC, Burger King, and Subway as well as local food sellers. Once inside Legoland you cannot go outside anymore so stock up on water before coming in. They allow bottled water but no outside food in the park. We bought our tickets online and printed it at home so getting in the park is hassle free. Also download Uber so u can go to Legoland from anywhere in Johor Bahru.  ",5.0
1183,Good Park but Not Worth It,I visited Lego Land from Kuala Lumpur so took a Causeway Link Bus for 58Rm for Each Way. Bus leaves at 7am from Swiss Garden reaches about 12pm at Lego Land. We went inside and spend till 5pm and covered the whole park. There many rides where the kid should be above 120cm to enter which made no sense if accompanied by adult also. If you have been to Disney land or Universal Studious than this is not to good for you. They toys are really expensive and not worth. Got a Batman Clock for 168 RM. Took the bus at 6:30pm to KL for RM 58 each even for Kids and reached at 11:30pm. For me The journey of 8 Hours and the price of the tickets are not worth the rides they have. ,3.0

1188,Great Attraction ,It's one of the great attractions for visitors to come and enjoy. The theme park is huge and also have 'wet world' which is a big swimming pool. The only thumbs down is the fee is so ridiculous for people to enjoy. The fee is RM100+ for just a day of fun. I don't think it's much of having fun when thinking how much money you have lost for the entire family just for a ticket.,4.0
1189,Great fun for the whole family,A fun attraction with lots to do for kids aged 4 and above. Enjoyable for the parents too as you get to spend time doing exciting stuff with the kids.

1197,"Bring A Fan, An Umbrella and Wear A Lot of Sunscreen",We went to Legoland as a side trip while staying in Singapore. It was fun but it was very hot so we tended to go to the attractions which were airconditioned. There are lines but it doesn't take too long to get in on any ride. Our group loved the chicken cheese dogs from the kiosks and finished up two batches. We also ate at the Market Restaurant. The servings are big so families with small kids can opt to share food instead of buying individually. The Star Wars display is a definite must-see. It would have been perfect if it wasn't too hot. We came out about 3 shades darker and exhaustes by the heat. ,4.0

1200,Excellent and I have some critical tips for you,"Well, after a long deliberation, we did the trip to Legoland from Singapore.   And.......it was fantastic - our 10 year old, 8 and 4 had an absolute ball.  To ensure you have a seamless trip follow the hints below:1-buy your tickets in advance from any tour agencies in Singapore - its about 30% cheaper than the on line price.  I went to filatravel at Lucky Plaza - see photo2-if you have a family of less than 6, get a Legoland Singapore/Malaysia taxi service - we went by the WTS bus service and the border crossing took 1.5 to 2 hrs EACH WAY!!  If you are in a private vehicle, you don't have to get out of the car and it works out about the same price 3-go on Mondays or Tuesdays out of local school holidays - we did and the longest wait time was about 15 mins4-if you only have 1 day, forget the water park - legoland is waaaaaaay too big to do both in one day5-a lot of the park attractions are A/C if you are worried about the heat and drinks in the park are reasonable 6 - they are super strict on minimum height on rides so If you think 1-2cm under is ok, think again.  We tried it and our 8 and 4 year old got turned back a couple of times -and no, they won't let u stand on tip toesHave fun everyone! ",5.0
1201,Fun day for the kids,A fun place for the kids although it would be better for the kids to be above 5 years old to fully enjoy as most attractions and rides have an age or height limit. We spent a full day there from 10am to 6pm and it's definitely advisable to avoid school holiday periods in order to avoid spending too much time queuing.,4.0
1202,A delightful place for kids and Lego fans,"We came here as a family of four with kids aged 7&9. We had a great time.Positives: the staff were friendly and helpful. The place and facilities are well maintained, and clean. The Miniland consists of replicas of famous landmarks in Malaysia and Asia, and is very impressive. There are things to suit young and older kids. There are several large playgrounds for free play. There is a variety of rides, some mild, and a few roller coasters. Our favourite ride is the new Ninjago ride, which is an interactive ride where you can battle as a ninja. We went at least 6 times in a row. We were there from Sunday to Wednesday, and there were hardly any queues on any of the rides, so almost no waiting time. We also enjoyed the Driving school where kids get to drive their own cars, supervised by staff on 'real' roads and they then have the opportunity to get their own licence for RM 25. Really cool! Another's highlight is Build+test, where you can build your own Lego car and race them. We spent hours in this attraction, which is also air conditioned, a great respite for this climate. Another air conditioned activity is the Ninjago live puppet show which was really well done.Food was reasonable. We ate at Market restaurant, which offers local and western food. My son who has allergies to egg and dairy had the chicken rice, and he found it better than the one in the nearby mall. Kids meals were RM 20, includes drink; adults combo meals were RM30+. Staff here were helpful with allergies too.Negatives: the hot weather is really draining. By 11am, my kids were whinging. So take respite by having indoor activities in between. Lots of ice blocks and water help.The weather starts to get more pleasant from 3-4pm, but of course you have the risk of a thunderstorm (which we didn't get, thankfully).On one of the days, were turned up to the Ninjago ride and the boating school between 10-10:10 am, and we were informed that the rides were not ready due to maintenance, and they could not tell us when it would be ready. I think these things should should have been done outside of opening hours.Also, the Mindstorm Robotics session: the instructions were really poor and not even the adults could follow them. We were totally lost. A few attractions were closed while we were there.Other tips: bring sunscreen and mosquito repellent. If you have time, the waterpark is next door and requires separate tickets. It is worth it for relief from the hot weather.The theme park is small compared to others. Although we were easily occupied ourselves for 4 days here, most people would be finished in 1-2 days, depending on your pace. The park closes at 7pm on weekends and 6pm on weekdays, so it is relatively early.",4.0
1203,Kids love it!!!,"As with any other Legoland around the world, this is one unique theme park. My eldest, aged 6, who had just passed its minimum height requirement for riding alone, had enjoyed the most. We bought an annual pass and had so far made 4 visits. If Legoland hotel is too expensive for you, opt for a few 2/3-star hotels nearby. It can cost you as low as MYR150 for a decent room, as you won't care for other facilities after one whole day at the park. ",5.0

1205,The amazing Theme Park,At first we were told horrible reviews about Legoland Malaysia but as we entered the theme park our views about Legoland Changed Dramatically. The customer service there is very nice and so are all the ride managers at the rides. Legoland theme park has a house amount of rides/slides and learning centre for people of all ages.The theme parks has many carnival stands and stages so that we can have fun there. The Miniland at Legoland blew my mind I just couldn't belive that how you could make the Taj Mahal or The Great Wall of China or the Pe·π≠ronas Twin tours. Personally my family did not decide to go to the water park as tickets for the water park + theme park were expensive. Ya and I just want to say that it is much better if you spend a whole day there we had a short amount of theme there and that is why we couldn't complete it but my overall experience was amazing.,5.0
1206,Fun and Great Value,Who said theme parks are only for kids? Me and my friend enjoyed our one day visit here in LEGOLAND. It was really fun.,4.0
1207,Exciting ,"We came in middle July, the weather was not that hot, there was rain but not for long.  Tried all the rides and they were suitable for children. Especially the new ride of Ninja Go, in here you can compete with other person in the same group for highest score. Plenty restaurant to cater all the guest. And there is the water park, but we did not go there since you can not make the two theme parks in one day. However the kid was happy. There's no Legoland without the lego bricks and merchandise so headed to the store and be ready be broke, the price was tad cheaper than in city store.",5.0
1208,Theme park,"Fun for the kids and adults too. They have wet and dry park so you can spend the whole day there. On top of that, they have theme park hotel you can stay in.",5.0
1209,Good value for 5-yr old kids and above!,"This is our 3rd time to go here as requested by my son for his birthday. When we went here, they have a special Star Wars theme for the month so that's a plus! It's good that we went on Sunday because it is less crowded and the weather is not that hot. My son was able to enjoy all of the rides especially the ones in Technic and The Kingdom. We were also lucky to be able to let our son join and train as a Jedi. He had the chance to go up on stage and defeat Darth Vader...hehehe! I must say that this is the best time we had in Legoland because before, there are a lot of rides that he's not allowed to ride. Also, I suggest that you book the tickets early in their website so that you'll get a good deal. You can also book in Qoo10 coz sometimes they are cheaper. Tip: Make sure that you check the Legoland website if they have any special events for the month. It's really fun if they have. One time, we went to a Brick or Treat event (October-November) and it was also really fun!",5.0
1210,Fun Theme Park,"The theme park itself is fun. More suitable for 4 to 8 year old. But the food serve in the theme park is super expensive and lousy. If you can, maybe can go outside of theme park to have the fastfood McDonald which just located outside of the park.",4.0
1211,A great family getaway,"We bought one day combo ticket online which they give 20%off if you booked 7 days prior to your date. We went to theme park first then water park in afternoon. The weather is pretty hot, make sure you have your drinks regularly and try to go to indoor activity after being in hot sun. They have a great staff which is very friendly and helpful. I left behind my phone during one of the ride, then i went to their guest service the phone was found and keep in their lost and found. Thank God these days they still have some honest people!Then we went to the water park, if you stayed in legoland hotel try not to bring any items with you so you can enjoy the facility. They have some locker for rental if you need to secure your things. Lifeguards are everywhere to ensure your safety. Too bad they closed by 5pm so you have to ensure to calculate your timing when you go there.",4.0
1212,Amazing time,"Had a wonderful time at the park with a 7 year old. There's the theme park and the wet park. We spent a whole day at the dry park and still not covered everyting. Legoland theme park is made up of rides following the lego themes. Rides are pretty mild, so suitable for children. We loved the area where we can build our car and race it down the track. Food is expensive and we have to avoid the temptation to buy all the legos. They put the lego shop that is the theme of the ride at the end of every ride (sneaky). We also had a 2 year old and she was not tall enough for almost all the rides. We went on a Friday and the queue for the rides was almost non-existent. It can get hot in mid day. ",5.0
1213,Super good! ,"As written by a seven year old: We loved it so much especially the water park which was heaps of funIn Legoland we loved the Lego drivers licence, the new Ninjago ride was excellent. I liked the Robotics workshop and being play  to play Lego wherever we were The train ride was good and the boat rides were cool.  Car building was fun too.  ",5.0
1214,Wonderful,"Saw constant improvement throughout the years. Many return visitors from Singapore, and it has becoming regular visits by locals. ",5.0
1215,dream come true,"My son 9years old and myself visited on Thursday 22 June,  WOW is all I can say. As Lego freaks we were in awe.  The park is extremely clean water and snack stands all over.  NO Q's were the the ultimate plus point. My son did a mindstorm workshop which he loved. The staff all over are most helpful and friendly We had so much fun and it did take up our whole day.  Highly recommend visiting",5.0
1216,Had a gathering at the legoland,"Reached at before it opens the door at 10.00amThis place e is huge! With water theme park and several different theme that is set in Star Wars, different country style. Restaurant were also available, but the price for the restaurant were pretty high. As it targeted the tourists visitors.Love the rides, as it is not too over exciting for me as I am pretty old to take those overly exciting rides.There were many welcoming shows available at different timing too.Worthy to go. As Lego is our pastimes favourite.",4.0
1217,Good for smaller kids and a quick break,"Legoland's Hotel feels like it has seen some foot traffic, but clean. It's still great fun for the kids, especially the elevators (seriously)! The breakfast buffet get's really crowded at times, try and be early!Legoland itself is awesome for smaller kids, say ages 2 - 12. It use to be very hot with only a little shelter, they have improved that a lot over the years. Waterpark is worth a day's visit too. I would recommend it for a 1 night hotel stay, visiting both parks. After which the adults would need a break!",4.0
1218,Wonderful place to visit with family,"At first me and with my family is a bit nervous to visit there from Singapore by using bus. Then when after we arrived at Mall, we walk with curiosity. But when we see the main gate and the Hotel, we are so amazed and until today my kids are always telling when we will go to LEGOLAND again? We will definitely come again and hoping LEGOLAND Malaysia can add more LEGO Friends figures and  playground (Y) Best wishes!!",5.0
1219,The Little Child's Paradise,"A very wide recreational area, complete with various games for children. Our 5th-old son can play all the games there. He was very excited. Many new games they found in legoland, such as Ninjago, Boating, Ninjago 4D, Star Wars, etc .. Very innovative and fun for small children and adults. For those of you who have young children under 10th, we strongly recommend to visit Legoland. Guaranteed your child will ask back there.",5.0
1220,Good for the less-daring ones,The rides were not so exciting. It's more for young children and people who do not have strong hearts for hair-raising rides.,4.0
1221,Get a season pass for great savings!,"Legoland was great with the kids. I have a 4 and 3 year old. They could go on so many rides by themselves or accompanied by an adult. The park is really designed for the little ones and not teenaged like most parks. However, there are older aged attractions for teenagers as well that we didn't see. We went for 2 days and it was enough? You could go back many times. The season pass is around RM1100 for 2 x adults and 2 x children. You will spend over half of that on a day entry. So if you live in Singapore or close by in Malaysia buy the season pass it's well worth it. If you go outside school holidays you don't have to wait long for the rides. I am unsure of holidays and how busy they are.We also went to the waterpark next door which was good but nothing like Legoland.",5.0
1222,Brilliant,"Superb park. My almost 4 year old loved the place and could sit on a lot of rides.The train, boat ride, mini roller coaster, 4D movies, play areas were all superb.This isn't a park for the older people. Universal in Singapore is more apt for them - my 3 year old did not enjoy there that much last year I when I went.The water park is superb too. Lots of things for younger children.The Asian deli, pizza place and the burger joint have good food. Although make sure you tell the pizza place to cook the pizza well else it's a bit undercooked.Definitely planning to visit again next year.",5.0
1223,Tired,Great theme park if you have young lego fans in your family - but the park is tired and in need of maintenance - especially the mini world. Also note that 90% if the park shuts down when thunder storms come through. Likewise for the lego water park next door. We paid for tickets to both parks but didn't even get a toe wet at the water park before it was shut down for the day - with no ticket or locker refund. Not great at all.,3.0
1224,A better place for kids to spend time,The legoland a better place for kids to spend time. had many games to play and kids enjoyed alot.. value for money ,4.0
1225,Fun weekend getaway,"Went for a weekend trip from Singapore. I think in hindsight it was a good idea to stay at the legoland hotel for the night because not only the hotel was lovely but we could then do both the legoland theme park and the water park (one on each day). Hotel - Loved the room decors, the bunk beds, the treasure chest game in the room and the box of legos to play with. My son had a blastLegoland - Lot's of things for kids to do. Not so much for the adults but the experience is itself is unique. It was very hot when we visited in June. So we did most of the indoor stuff in the afternoon and the outdoor ones in the evening. Waterpark - Lot of fun. It has something for all age groups. We really enjoyed our time here and would definitely recommend people to visit this one.",5.0
1226,Rainy day,"When I went here, it was rainingSo, we must bought raincoatAnd if you must buy, buy inside the theme parkCheaper than the store in the hotelIf you don't really love lego, and don't have young children, maybe you will not really enjoy this parkBecause i came here was raining, so i just spent about 2 hours here",3.0
1227,Fun with the family.,"In May 2017 visited during the week. No lines! Maybe due to the weather/time of year, only about half the rides/attractions were available. I recommend this place for kids under the age of 10. Unable to take food inside the park  however great food available to purchase at a reasonable price. Kids loved the Ninjago stage performance. Great variety of mini themed play parks inside for the kids to run around.",4.0
1228,So much fun,"Loved this, caters for everyone with roller coasters and smaller rides, Leggo activities, water park and decent food.",5.0
1229,Amazing water park,"We had wanted to visit legoland for the longest time and finally made this trip during the June holiday. However, we stayed at Hotel Jen instead which provided us with free transport to and fro legoland. We made the decision to only visit the water park as we only have 1 day and it was the right decision as buying the combo ticket though price very attractive would mean that we need to rush through the 2 parks. Once you walk past the entrance, you will see the water playground, aka Joker Soaker. It may look kiddish but some of the slides are pretty fast and enjoyable even for adults. It was good to note that there are plenty of life guards even at this attraction which is only ankle deep. They ate there to make sure the safety regulations are adhere too.Next up, we tried the Red Rush but it is really no rush.... Pretty slow and boring. We only went once and decided it is enough. We then went for the Splash and Swirl which was better but as we need to carry up the float ourself, we only took 2 rides.Next up, we tried the twin chaser. The green, open cover, is very slow. Dun waste your time. Go for the blue, covered up one. It is quite scary as it can be quite dark inside but that is the fun part of it.The highlight for our family is the Slide Racer. Our 2 children, age 8 and 10 enjoyed it so much that we must have taken at least 30 rides on this attraction. You can have up to a group of 6 persons competing to see who will be the fastest.... The lazy river, aka Build a raft is the perfect way to end the day as you go round and just let the current carry you.We went in at 10 am and left at 3:30 pm. We did not have lunch inside as there is limited choice and our tickets does not allow multiple entries. We had a late lunch at Burger King which is outside the theme park.",4.0
1230,A theme park you can surely spend the entire day without getting bored ,"Suits young children as the rides enable them to shoot at targets, roller coasters were of suitable challenges that even my 5year old could do. Maintenance can improve as the Bounce one wasn't available when we went. Need to bring sun hats and sunglasses as there is little shelter. Kids enjoyed half the time at theme park, went to water park to cool down and then back to theme park again. We ended up exchanging our pass for the annual pass where they had the 2+1 promo for RM990. ",4.0
1231,good spot for above 7 years children,"we love the legoland but for my youngest child which under 3 years the rides is limited, but for my another 8 and 10 years children it was super fun",5.0
1232,Wonderful place for family outing,"It is still considered as a new theme park in Johor, so the facilities are generally still in very good condition. I hope they could maintain that.They have variety of rides, shows and games around the park, but claiming that it is for all ages are not too accurate. Majority of the rides are for 4 years old and above and the child needs to be at least more than 100cm. They are quite strict with this rules.There are few restaurants/cafes around the park. I would recommend the pizza place in Imagination park. The pizza is very delicious and the restaurant is very comfortable.Make sure to check the weather forecast before going here. Prepare sunblock and hat if the weather is going to be sunny as it can be very warm and hot. Make sure to bring umbrella or raincoat if it is going to rain as it can rain heavily instantly.",4.0
1233,Child-at-heart experience,This place is good for the child-at-heart. Recommended for families with little children. It is amazing to see the various attractions of the world in miniature replica,4.0
1234,Great once you get there,"We came from Singapore for a day trip and wish I knew it was going take four hours to get there, then 4:30 to get back due to ridiculously long immigration lines to get out and back into Singapore. Thus we only had 4 hours to enjoy the park. Consider a private car instead of coach, where you also have to wait for all passengers to clear customs. I heard the line for the cars can be nuts as well. We went on a Thursday.Legoland JB was smaller than the one in Windsor that we have visited prior, but the queues were short for the rides, the miniland was interesting with the main Asian buildings, and staff was friendly along with reasonable meal prices at least compared to US/UK parks.We lucked out with a cloudy day after a cooling rain. May want to bring an umbrella for rain or sun. There is a KFC and Burger King along with some other restaurants at the front entrance along with some shopping stores.",4.0
1235,A fulfilling trip,"We accompanied our young adult son to his long and much awaited trip to Legoland.  He enjoyed it even though he is a yound adult.  We, too enjoyed it especially the miniland of various places in Malaysia & other countries which was very well done up and admired the hard work put into them to put the lego pieces together.",4.0
1236,Not worth the money,"Not worth the money, paid RM1000/day & bought 3 nights package and definitely not coming back!!The room cleanliness was so poor, the toilet smeel, we stayed in the kingdom theme room and the decor was so average.  The lego in the treasure box is tiny lego my kid didn't even wanna play with it.  The room service was terrible, the staff told me that they ran out of burger, pizza & chicken drumlet on our first day then ordered room service the second day same thing happened!! The theme park was so dissapointing, the rides were so average, paid so much for the entrance tickets though, not worth the money the hotel & the theme park! Definitely not coming back",1.0
1237,So so..,"Good place..but i may say, not too good as i thought it would be. In Jakarta, there are several place similar to Lego Land. And the ticket price..? Yes, they're lots more cheaper than this. But, its's ok, at least now i can say, i've visited Lego Land Malaysia. ",3.0
1238,Excellent for kids !,"I was travelling with 2 boys ( 9 and 10 yo ) June 2017 and they enjoyed very much. We took 2 days combo ticket and we really explore the park entirely. WATER PARKThere is Lazy river, theme water slides for smaller kids, but bigger kids can enjoy them too, wave pool ( although the wave is quite weak as my kids said ), many water slides. Enjoy building your own raft in lazy river with rubber legos. Lockers are available with reasonable fee, although renting the towels are quite expensive. Since we forgot to bring our waterproof pocket for the handphone, we took our picture in the photo booth. Quite costly 60 ringgit per picture. Comes with the nice folder. THEME PARKIf you travel with smaller kids, you might want to go straight to the right : LEGO CITY, LAND OF ADVENTURE and IMAGINATION. There is nursery room at the IMAGINATION area. Do take the map of the park at the entrance. There is again handy lockers just after the entrance, also there is rental for wheel chairs and stroller, which is fantastic!Overall, in each area there are combine games and rides for bigger kids and toddlers. So do take your time to explore all. If you go to the left, there is LEGO TECHNIC, which my kids favourite is the robotic class at the Lego Mindstorms. Afterwards we go towards the Lego Starwars, fantastic miniature of all the starwars movies. At the kingdom we play the highest roller coaster for at least 6 times. There are 3 roller coasters in this park, first is in the lego technic, and 2 at the Lego Kingdom. By looking at the track you can see which one suits you and kids most. The biggest excitement is the Lego Ninjago at the LAND OF ADVENTURE. Queing is very long, takes us about 30 to 45 mins, but it's worth it. There you are riding kind of ""train"" and presented to big screens where you can help ninja shooting the bad guys. Same ideas on the Lost Kingdom Adventure but less que. We also went for the Observation Tower which is nice and easy. If you go for the 4D studio next to it, look for the middle seat, so you can enjoy the ""snow"" showers and water mist. The movie took only 15 mins. At the end we took about 1 hour to explore the MINILAND, where there are many miniature of the city made from Lego. Kids can press buttons so the lego will move. Fantastic !We did bought some toys there, but do take your time and go around to look for good discounts in some shops. For parents that is smoking, there are designated area for smoking all around. I found 2 of them next to Lego mindstorm ( LEGO TECHNIC ) and next to the kingdom. Our kids eats hot dogs all the time there. According to them the hot dogs are yummy. We drank at least 6 bottles of water during the whole day visit. Price of 1 bottle is 3 ringgit.  In general, we are very satisfied with the trip. All the journey was worth it. We go thru Changi Airport, by car to Johor Baru. There are many choices of transport from Changi. The easiest one is to rent taxi ( book in advance thru website ). Although it is costly ( 100 SGD / trip ). I recommend better to go to Senai Airport in Johor Baru. Dont go thru Changi. Grab & Uber cars are available in Johor Baru. Although in Legoland can be quite difficult to get. There are blue taxis everywhere. They are quite expensive, but easy to get. We were staying at Impiana condominium, close to Legoland. Valuable in price and the apartment is large. We took 3 bedrooms for 3 nights. Cheap, large and clean. They give us basic amenities and free wifi. Very satisfying !",5.0
1239,Super Fun Park,"Stayed at Legoland Resort, the entry to Legoland Themed Park is located at LG2. To save time queing make sure we already purchased tickets online. If we purchased more than 7 days before the entry date we will received extra discounts for early bird.At the gate they will search for the bags for any foods and drinks are not allowed. However, they are not so strict about it where we carried 2 bottles of coke and still allowed to entry. At the entry point ensure we have ID ready as they will confirm the ticket with our name.Inside the Park, start from the left side and just follow the sign to enjoy all rides. If you come in a high seasons, you might try to que the Ninjago ride first and enjoy the others later. Love the 4D movies, comes in 4 episodes with different screening times. Park closed at 6pm someday at 7pm.Caution the park is extremely hot. Make sure sunblock ready. Overall awesome park.",4.0
1240,Dated park needs some work,"We have a 7 and 10 year old and they seemed to have a good time. A lot of the displays are good but don't hold attention for our kids. The rollercoasters are good. Very hot in the middle of the day.A few areas where you get to make stuff but again, boring.You get totally wet on the flume ride, which is ok given the temp.Food is terrible so pack some as the security getting in is poor.The place is dirty but that's Malaysia.If coming from Singapore, forget it. You have to go through 2 lots of immigration which takes forever. A seemingly easy 45min bus ride turned into 2 hours EACH WAY. A big waste of time and put a big dampener on the day.",3.0
1241,Simply amazing at (almost) every turn,"I almost cannot fault this place. It is simply awesome. They have thought of every detail and made it such a fun place to be. The theming throughout is incredible and so much time and care has been made into making this the perfect hotel for kids. My only complaint is that the buffet breakfast in the morning isn't very good. They have an incredibly huge selection but the quality isn't great or perhaps it just gets old too quickly. I think if they halved the selection and increased the quality, it would be a much better way to go. We travelled with a 2- and 4-year old and the hotel was perfect for them. The Legoland Theme Park and Waterpark, however, is amazing but better suited to older kids (5-10 yrs). There were so many rides that our kids wanted to go on but couldn't. My 2-year old barely went on anything in the theme park. The water park had a bit more for them, which they both loved. They still had fun so it wasn't a complete waste. Just not ideal. We will definitely come back again, but perhaps in another 3 years (it'll probably take us that long to save up again!). ",5.0
1242,Good if you are a Lego fan,"I am a lego fan since I was a young kid and I passed it on to my son, therefore we enjoyed our time in Legoland. When we went there, it is a weekday and it feels like the theme park is ours because we don't need to cue to go to the rides. My son enjoyed Legoland more than in Universal Studios.",4.0
1243,Fun amusement park for kids,We came here with a group of 10 adults n 4 kiddos under 12. It would be a pleasant time if it didnt rain in the afternoon coz there're still so many rides we havent try yet. ,4.0
1244,Holiday visit with gf,Place was nice alot of rides and que are short even though we go at peak season. But every rides seems small and short compare to USS. Plus point is nice place to get photo shoots.,3.0
1245,Good for family with small kids,Themed hotel is kids friendly. It is play paradise for small kids especially aged 4 and above. I brought my 2.5yo and enjoyed both water and theme parks. Only the hotel breakfast is a lil crowded. Will go again in future.  ,5.0
1246,Great for 1st timer...,We are here because of kids. Doubt if we will come if all adults gang. Not a bad idea for 1st timer here with kids. Lot of thingy not for adult but parents with kid play together. I don't think will come again for myself. Kid too young are not suitable too.... best age above 8 years old for my point of view. ,3.0
1247,"Good, but probably better for younger kids","A few of the rides were aimed at younger kids than ours who are 9. There were some good rides for slightly older kids. Some of the Lego, whilst impressive, was looking a little tired from being outdoors and exposed to the the weather. The staff though were absolutely lovely. ",3.0
1248,Kids heaven,"My husband & I went here with our daughter, son in law and two grandsons (6 & 4) from Australia and would highly recommend it for a very special day out.  The cleanliness, attention to detail, focus on safety made us all feel very comfortable.  All six of us had a great time and were thrilled with it all.",5.0
1249,Disappointed,"We were excited to go here but the more we stay, the more bored we got. Some rides are under maintenance. The staff who work in shops and cafe move sluggishly. Food is way too expensive and doesnt taste great.",3.0
1250,well organised for children,"it was my first experience with legoland. I was impressed. It is very suitable for children aged 4 and above, although if you want to sit ALL rides, you need to be 6 and above 120cm. Most rides allow 4yo and 100cm when accompanied with an adult. I have been to USS twice, and honestly, USS is more suited for teenagers. For kids, legoland wins. hands down.in terms of security, it seems that legoland was designed with that in mind. single point of entry for not just the park, but most of the attractions / playgrounds. I am quite paranoid about that.overall, i would highly recommend it for families with young children (4yo and above).",5.0
1251,"For the kids, the young kids ...","Went to Legoland Malaysia during the June school holiday with my 2 young neices, aged 7 and 3.   They enjoyed the simple, non-threatening rides and shows.  Surprisingly, it wasn't crowded at all and it was easy to get on the rides as the queues were real short.    However, a major riide, the water slide ride, was out for maintenance.Food and drinks are available inside the theme parks and they serve the usual kid friendly meals.Overall, this place is for the very young at heart.   As a feedback, I wish the theme park would pay attention to the upkeep of the displays.  Some of them weren't working, or lego bricks chipped off.   And as a suggestion, perhaps the theme park would consider installing water drinking fountains inside the park and water misting fans to cool the guests on a hot day.",4.0
1252,First time there,Went to the water theme park and my boy enjoyed himself very much... small lockers for whole day for 20rm and large lockers for 40rm. Shower rooms provided with all in one shampoo and body foam. Rides are entertaining and fun. Food and beverage is on the steep end as with all theme parks targeted at tourists. Lifeguards are friendly and mostly can converse in english. Clean environment.,4.0
1253,Great improvement since 2012,What vast improvements done to this place! More fans and shelters have been built since 2012. The ninjago ride is amazing! A great experience overall for my 2 young kids. Well doneüëç,4.0
1254,Nice theme park,Nice theme park but so HOT.Kids very happy to play here especially roller coaster. Not to big theme park but enough for young kids,5.0
1255,Grrat day out.,Staying in Singapore which gives you multiple options to get to the park. We opted for a private transfer to Legoland. Its a short trip but can have delays due to immigration stops.Arrived at 10am and walked the park for the next 6.5 hours. Kids both 11yrs loved it as did their mother who is a bit older than 11. The park is bigger than expected and caters for all ages. The pizza place is great for lunch and we took snacks with us also.Unless you have a burning desire to ride the roller coasters etc  again and again one day is enough to have a good look around and try everything. The Lego shop has a huge selection of things to buy and the prices were a lot better than I had imagined. Great day out and if you or the kids are Lego fans it is a must do.,5.0
1256,Awesome experience for kids and kids at heart,"Legoland Malaysia is a great choice for our first family vacation abroad! We love love love Legoland hotel. Fun starts at the lobby as you are greeted by high ceiling with a castle and pirate ship playareas where there are Lego blocks everywhere. Receptionists are accommodating. The disco-elevator was a delight for our daughters every time we ride it to go up and down or just have a disco-time. Beyond the Bricks cafe is another play area with giant blocks, just dance for kids, and movie screening every night. We are literally tired every day because of the many activities you can do at the hotel. The room (Pirate Theme) is very nice! Packed with activities like treasure hunting... The hotel has a pool at the 5th level, where you can swim Lego blocks. Breakfast buffet was something to look forward to every morning! Lots and lots of food choices especially for kids. I haven't began with the theme park and water park! Just quickly, both needs at least a day for you to enjoy all the amenities. Pack yourself with sun block, fans, umbrella, water, extra shirts, extra batteries. The whole experience brought back childhood memories and dreams while enjoying it with our kids! We are planning our next trip back! Enjoy!",5.0
1257,Too much fun,We went on a Monday as a day trip from Singapore via bus. The place was practically empty and we could explore everything to our heart's content. we did all the good rides 4 times at least. The new section opened is awesome. The LEGO Ninjago ride is very unique.,5.0
1258,A good attraction for tourists and kids,"It is so nice visiting Legoland in Malaysia. It brings a memory back in Legoland London. Bring a bottle of water to explore this amusement park. And make sure to stop at the souvenir shop in every section, you'll find something interesting. Happy exploring :)",4.0
1259,Fun for kids and parents,"Surprisingly good theme park for kids. Rollercoasters were not tame for kids under 12 but not too terrifying for accompanying adults. Note that there are age and height restrictions for most rides. There are some shaded areas but the weather is warm, so expect to sweat and consume lots of water. The Legoland map also informs you of which rides and attractions are airconditioned, so you know where to seek refuge from the heat. The Lego academy is interesting for slightly older kids - say up to 15 yrs old but you have to sign up for the timeslots there. For younger kids between 3-5yrs old, there are a few rides available in the Lego City area - the Junior Driving school, the rescue academy, Boating School - as well as in the Kingdom area - Merlin's Challenge and the Royal Joust. They can also ride the Ninjago Ride and Lost Kingdom Adventure, both of which are airconditioned. The rollercoasters are generally not available to younger kids. In the water park, most rides are not suitable for younger kids, but the current pool, wave pool and water playground tend to occupy them. Small lifejackets are also supplied, which is very handy.  Food and drinks are expensive in the park, and there aren't many options. There is a small shopping mall directly outside the park which has several other food options - Thai, Old Town White Coffee, Subway, KFC and a few others. There is also a sports store there for swimming wear etc. They had this Annual Pass offer when we were there - you can deduct the cost of your admission ticket from the price of the Annual Pass, so it was relatively cheap for us to buy the Annual Pass. Annual passholders also get 10% off at the Brick Shops in Legoland. Note that some Lego products are unique to particular brick shops, so if you see something you want to buy, don't expect to find it elsewhere or in the main shop near the entrance. Tips: Weekday queues are much shorter than weekends. Avoid Malaysian holiday seasons if you are travelling from overseas. Don't go in December - queues will be too long. Also, I saw several guests carrying umbrellas to shade from the sun. I thought it was a good idea although we did all have broad-brimmed hats. Sunscreen is a must. We all turned a shade darker after two days there. ",5.0
1260,A great day out,"We spent 1 day in the theme park, exhausted due to the hot weather. But we all had fun. Although there are not many rides and games suitable for my 3yo, he did enjoy being inside a theme park that full of interesting structures and buildings (to him).We were there on a Sunday. Not very crowded and generally short waiting time for rides except those popular ones.The theme park is pretty big. Even one whole day is a bit rush to explore every bit. There are lots of restaurants and snack shacks inside and the food was surprisingly tasty. The washrooms are clean and well maintained. I was very impressed with the nursing room, very clean and cozy. ",4.0
1261,Fantastic,"We went on a Tuesday. Brought our tickets a few days before from an office near the Singapore Flyer. We chose the 9am departure time and returned at 645pm.  We had a wait in the morning at Singapore immigration of about 45 minutes but no wait at Malaysia and no wait on our return.   The rides close at 6 so this time return bus was perfect.   I would recommend this for families with kids between 4/5 to 10/12.  Younger than 4 would be bored and older than 12 same.  Most rides kids have to be at least 110cm tall.   We had a great day and the heat was easily escaped in the 4D movie, theatre or a/c rides.  ",5.0

Very limited entertainment for children that are 3yrs old or below.We went on a weekday and there were not many visitors, so queues are not more then 5mins.Recommend to apply sunblock and bring water along for the hot weather and the park could look into building more shelters or plant more trees to provide shade from the sun.Typical theme park food available in the park, so if your children are picky eaters, will have to make alternative plans for them.",4.0

There was just Lego every where. While we were checking in he just went straight to make something. The kids we saw around were going mad as if they are in a fairyland. The hotel is just awesome and the room are so cool. The rooms fits in 4-5 people but the downside is it has only one bathroom. They even have a quiz in the room that open up the locker with more Lego. The toiletries are well designed. We all want to go back. The theme park is cute and some kids can do rides on their own. It's super cool, do visit. ",5.0

1275,Great day trip from Singapore,"We took a day trip (by bus) from Singapore. The transport co provided a bus across the border into Malaysia and back again. Crossing the border was a bit of a wait, but we managed to make it to Legoland by 11am, and were there till 5pm.The park is a lot bigger than we expected and we did run out of time (mostly due to inclement weather delays), to do everything we wanted before the tour bus came back to collect us.The talent of the lego architects are ridiculously impressive and a large area of the park is set aside to display this.The restaurant has limited selection of food, but is entertaining for little ones with building stations with lego to play with while you wait for your food, and dance sessions learning the Agado with the ""chef"".Their height measures are different throughout the park, and somehow my 4yo who was tall enough for a (I thought scarier) ride not 5 mins earlier was stopped from going on another (pretty damn tame ride in comparison), because she suddenly became shorter than the required height limit (which was the same height limit as the scarier ride), and we were told she was not old enough to ride - she had to be 6?! Shouldn't the parent be the judgement on the age/maturity of their child?!Their was plenty of rides she could go on though and lots which were aimed at her age range, so she had an enjoyable day.Notes:Their inclement weather does shut down rides, however is more reasonable in judgement of length than the Singapore theme park.Recommendations:Go on a Tues or Wednesday. It was pretty quiet and we didn't have to wait more than 5 mins for a ride, and some of them we went round twice.Definitely use tour company, as it was then easy enough to navigate across the borders, and you don't have to drive after an exhausting day in humidity running around the park.Take a poncho for the inclement weather.We will definitely be going again. Great day out.",4.0
1276,Good place for family fun (for kids below 12),"This is not for older kids or teenages as most of the rides are more kiddish, unless they are Lego fanatics.

1281,3rd visit and they still love it,My kids are 12 and 7. They still love the place after 3rd visit. Overall good place for kids and adults as adults are also having fun at the theme park. Can consider more trees planting and more bench for waiting area and resting place with shades. Park is clean but can put in more recycle bins for recycling of water bottles and cans. Which I find it not sufficient in the 2 days visit. Food choices inside the park also limited with not much variety only fried chicken and burgers. Shopping is good with many good brick toys to buy at Legoland. ,5.0
1282,It's overrated,The park is not well-maintained. Food and drinks are too expensive. The rides are good for children 10 years and below. The mall adjacent to the theme park is like a ghost town.

1286,Waste of time and money! Cheating their customers!,"I understand that certain rides have height restrictions, but even when height restrictions are met, there's an age restriction to meet as well. For example, there's ride that has a 110cm height restriction and then followed with a 6 years old and above only. Legoland Malaysia should follow in tandem what other theme parks (Eg. Universal Studios Singapore) are doing and only choose one or the other in terms of height or age restrictions and not both. This is akin to cheating customers in not laying out your rules, and only after customers pay and enter the park only to find out of your double restrictions!Also, my daughter visits her paediatricians on a regular basis and her height is measured at 118cm at both her doctors (as of last visit in May '17) but surprisingly, she can't even pass the 110cm height restriction chart board placed at the entrance of the rides. I did my checking before purchasing the tickets on which rides had height restrictions and seeing that quite a number of rides had only 110cm height restriction, I then proceeded to specifically buy 3 tickets (my wife, my daughter and myself), all with Hero Pass (express lane) so that we could accompany her, only to find out that their on-site height board shows that she doesn't meet the height requirement. Does Legoland Malaysia even measure their height restriction boards to see if they are in compliance? Because this again is akin to cheating their customers!To parents with children under the age of 6 years old and/or height under 120cm, don't waste your time and money at Legoland Malaysia. Go to Universal Studios Singapore, where you will get a better quality product!",1.0
1287,Worthwhile visit for Lego lovers!,"We didn't expect much from this theme park but was pleasantly surprised on the variety of rides available. Eventhough my son was only 3 years old, he still managed to sit a few rides. The place was clean and colourful. We enjoyed ourselves. The Q for the rides were not too long too.A couple of suggestions:1) Have perhaps one more restaurant 2) Have maybe more Lego real life characters or mascots walking around to greet children 3) Have more interesting sights and sounds for the train ride Another thing we noted was the Lego shop was not as well stocked as we thought it would be. There was a particularly model we were looking for but was not available there although it was available in a shop in KL.",4.0
1288,2 Days Combo,"Just visited with a 2 days combo for 2 adults, 2 kids and a baby. With the 2 days combo, you can have multiple entries as both park sections are separated.Overall visit was nice and pleasant. The weather was not too bad with some slight drizzle in the morning and evening.My 10 year old fully enjoyed both the dry and water park. The rides and games just nice for his age and height of above 120cm.My 5 year old has less rides to enjoy due to the height restrictions but has a wonderful time non the less. He is a Lego fan so no problem with just sitting at the imagination building section and playing with Lego bricks.Overall, the dry theme park was enjoyable for all of us. The queue was minimal during our recent visit which was during school holiday but a weekday and ramadhan month.A whole day at the dry park recommended if with kids around 9-12 years old. Few classes to join as well for kids.Food was reasonable for a theme park (for a quater chicken set price was slightly higher only compared to Nandos). A kids nugget set with fries and drink is priced at RM20.Lockers are available for rent (small/large/x-large size) either 3-hours or full day rental. Fully digital, no physical key needed so no worries about losing the locker key.The water park section is not very big, a half day would suffice. We rented a half day private cabana for RM180. It comes with a small digital safe, drink cooler, 2 bath towels and 5 bottled drinks. Totally worth it as I do not need to spend on the drinks, towel rental and locker separately. My kids get to rest and my wife has a private space to breastfeed the baby.The few negative feedback/complain I have is that even though Legoland is aim at kids and families, the park isn't very baby friendly. Majority of the places aren't stroller permitted. We have problem entering shops as no stroller are allowed, and with a sleeping baby, we either have to take turns to enter or just skip it.The staffs are also not very kid friendly. I have been to few other countries theme parks but Legoland Malaysia staffs were totally not trained or interested in handling kids. Some rides staff were nice, but unfortunately majority of the other staffs were not. Other than a welcome and high-5 from the entrance staff....that was it.",4.0
1289,A day of Legoland and water park.  We should have done 2!,"We traveled across from Singapore to Legoland and stayed in a hotel just outside.Legoland itself was so quiet.  The whole local area is a development in progress and it was Ramadan.  I am sure that in years to come, and after Ramadan it will be a buzzing environment.Today though, it is very quiet and we didn't queue for a single attraction.  Considering we only spent a day, getting onto all attractions still took over half a day.  We couldn't understand where the time went.  We should have bought the 2 day pass because once we got to the water park, the fun really began!  Be sure to look at the scenes from the Star Wars movies.  They were brilliant!The water park had some great attractions, though some were closed for maintenance.  The kids had a smile on their faces all day.  We really wish we had done 2 days before heading back to Singapore.The only negative; bag searches were taking place but not for safety, they were making people throw away any outside food and drink.  It was not recommended to us to drink the water there so we had to buy a lot throughout the day.  It was all well priced but a frustrating waste.",5.0
1290,Shortest Q for rides Theme Park,"Generally everything is OK, value for money, bit upset with d food outlet, many thing out of stock, even tomato ketchup but still sell fries. ",3.0

It is especially spacious and relaxing to walk on weekdays, so do pick a day for a happier visit for your own.Their new Ninjago is funny to play, but pity that we encountered computer errors while playing their ride. They produce very good 4D movies, a very good experience for kids and fun-loving elderly.Their Chima miniland is excellent, where shows different countries' features in every detail. I was so amazed by the details and their humours they put together! And you can see Lego decorations everywhere in Legoland, big or small, with sound effects. This may the amusement park more fun!",5.0
1292,Ramadan: Best time to visit...,"Our favorite time to visit Legoland is during Ramadan (the Muslim fasting month) as crowds as less and queues are way shorter or sometimes even non-existent! We've enjoyed going on the same ride multiple times without getting off as there was no one else waiting in line...Having said that, the crowd does build up later in the evening from 3-4pm onwards, but still manageable. We covered the theme park on Day 1 and water park on Day 2. During this season, 1 day for each park was more than sufficient as we didn't need to spend much time waiting in lines. Also, we have been here on few different occassions and have a preference to which attractions we like. Noticed on this visit, that some attractions especially the miniature cities are showing heavy signs of wear and probably could use some touching up soon. Food and beverage is fairly decent, with different choices available around the park so do decide beforehand. Choices range from local food like Nasi Lemak to lasagna and burgers. Refreshment stalls are scattered around the Park as well. Prices are cheap, not by Malaysian standards, but compared to other theme parks everywhere else in the world. Example of set meal, mains + drink would cost about RM25-30 (USD6-8), very fairly priced in my opinion. Overall, the LEGOLAND theme park seemed more interesting compared to the water park as attractions in water park are not as comprehensive but it offers a whole different experience so if you have the time, try both out. Just bring the sunscreen along for both parks!",5.0
1293,fun for the little one,"if you have children,then this amusement park is the right choice for you. itsmaybe not as great as universal studio in singapore or Disneyland in Hongkong, but this is really meant for the little kid. and when i see my daughter happy all the time, then our mission is complete.the first info to all the guys to know, that there two park actually, the normal amusement park and the waterpark. if this is your first time visiting legoland i recomend to buy just the amusement park only, because time is not enought if you want to visit the waterpark in the same day, except you already go here and plan to go just a few ride not all, and the weather is great, then you can have the combo ticket. otherwise it wise to had just amusement park.thesecond is choose the summer season, since it asia, and only have 2 season, summer and rainy, it will be wise to go here only in summer or when the weather is good. if you dont have other choice, its still ok, they sell ponco there, so you still can enjoy the ride when rain is not to heavy.third, if you have one or two little one, rent a stroller if you dont bring one, the park is huge, maybe not as huge as universal or disneyland but for littleone it makes them tired, especially when the weather is hot.four, take the map and take a note in the show that each theme start, when i first coma, i didnt do it, so i miss all the show, next time will not happen again. and start to go in one direction, if from the gate, you choose to the leftm then follow all the way until you back to the gate, you can enjoy all the ride with no miss because of take a wrong path or what soever. if you chose to the right it also not a problem,you will keep circleing the park. and wont miss an attraction.this is one information that you must know, if your child is oleder than 6years and height 110cm, than his/her can enjoy all the ride. some attraction have certain age and height limitation. some neeg 4 years, some need over than 90cm or 100cm. but if your kid 6 years and over than 110cm its more than enought.in each theme, there always some playing ground and some restaurant, as usual, the price little bit pricey like always in all other park. and also they have picture in each attraction taht we can paid if we want to print it down, whis is a thing that need extra money, because if this is your first time, you need the photo as memoir and trust me its not cheap (if you print all your picture in each attraction) like i do hehehe. but then again next time go here, i will not print any of the picture to save money.dont forget to equip yourself with comfortable clothes, comfy shoes (we will take a loong walk)enought water for drink and a hat.",4.0
1294,Mostly for kids and Lego enthusiasts,"We went on a Sunday, and surprisingly there weren't many people around. We were almost always first in line at the rides. We enjoyed Ninjago the Ride the most. The park per se' is mostly for kids and Lego fans. The rides are fun, but don't expect much on thrill factor. There are also minimum height requirements (and certain body dimension restriction -- for the Lego Technic ride, so those on the bulky side may not be able to enjoy certain rides.) We were sad that the dino island was under maintenance, though it was not part of the ones previously announced as scheduled for such. It can get really warm and humid in the afternoon, and there are only a few shaded areas so hats/visors and a cooling towel or evian spray are a must. The Miniland is great for photo op. We're lucky enough to catch the Star Was Miniland (May line-up), and win cool prizes (we're probably the only Star Wars fans in the bunch.) Overall ok for a first visit.",4.0
1295,Fantastic for little children,"Some rides were only suitable for adults or kids older than 8yo about 3 rides. The rest are all suitable for super young to adults!

For the annual pass price it's worth it to come back, though the dry theme park needs some maintenance on some rides and display.",4.0
1296,Disappointed with the lack of maintenance ,"Was there with a Friend at the theme park to check out the area.  Was disappointed to see that quite a few rides was under maintenance and that overall, the park appeared to require better upkeeping and maintenance.  Exhibits looked dusty at some of the areas.  There wasn't much crowd on a weekend so queues were swift.  Overall the park feels like it had a lot of untapped potential for better rides and exhibits.  ",3.0
1297,Below expectations,I was eagerly looking forward to my Legoland trip but when I came to km now that it is 320 km away from KL and it takes around 4hrs to reach there was very disappointed. I tried to cancel my booking but then it meant loss of Rs 25000(1700RM) as our tickets and vehicle were pre booked. So I went there but it was a bad day for us as it started raining heavily and went on tilll the time we were there so we couldnt enjoy the rides. Though all rides were functional but it was not easy in rains to ride n walk. Spend only 2hrs there and then decided to leave. But if at all it was not raining then also it is not an extraordinary place to be visited by spending so much money and time. As you need 8-9 hrs for travelling so it means u have to leave early around 7 in the morning then u will reach there by 11-11:30 and again u should leave by 3 so that u can reach KL by 7:30-8 in the night.  Not recommended,2.0
1298,NOT GOOD FOR YOUNG KIDS,"The park is lovely and of very high quality. However, check the height restrictions first. Most of the rides require you to be 102-107cm (almost 70% of the rides). This was a shocking experience as we had drove over from Singapore not knowing there would be very little for our son to ride. The food is not great with very little variety, and is quite expensive for Malaysia. Don't fear ... Thomas Land and Hello Kitty is close by if size is a problem; they accommodate 2-5yr olds much better.",2.0
1299,Unpleasant experience with the lack of shade and horrible security guard ,"First off , ridiculous and stupid security guard . We visited the park with a 4 year old and a six month old baby . A hard boiled egg and steam sweet potato was packed in the bag for baby's lunch but the security insisted on confiscating both as ""no outside food is allowed "" .  He CANNOT be reasoned with , and don't seem to understand that pizza / spaghetti and Penang laksa are NOT suitable for a 6 months old's lunch üò†. We had to leave the park after 3 hrs since there's no baby food on sale either ... keep in mind there is NO RE ENTRY allowed . The park was ok , but hot and humid weather coupled with lack of trees for shade makes it harder for young children to enjoy the park and rides .  Be careful of pricing structures in F&B outlet as set meals can be priced higher than individual component . ie set meal with a bottle of soft drink is 28 rm , without 21 Rm . The individual soft drink bottle costs only 5 . Having been suckered into topping up 7 rm to get a bottle of soft drink with our meal, we clarified the situation with the staff to confirm that the top up was indeed a bad deal for suckers ...and the response was a sheepish ""yea it's more expensive to top up than to buy ala carte"". We're huge fans of Lego , but are not likely to  be visiting Legoland again - at least not the Malaysia franchise . ",2.0

1301,Good for all ages but VERY HOT,"Caveat emptor: a lot of online ticket packages DO NOT admit to both the theme park and the waterpark. Given the insanely hot and humid conditions at the location the waterpark should be considered a must!Staff were very helpful and we did not encounter any delays to speak of on any rides. There are rides for kids from 2+ all the way to *ahem* big kids. The waterpark is just that. A number of water slides and rides. There's really only one area suitable for very young kids the rest of the rides/areas you need to be over 105cm to do. Some slides would be scary for some kids due to being enclosed in the dark and fast.BRING YOUR OWN TOWEL or rent one there.Food was very good and surprisingly not the rip-off price you assume theme parks would charge.Naturally, everywhere someone is trying to sell you a photo of you in/on/around an attraction.It is a slight pain in the rear to go through the border crossing twice in a day when you're day tripping from Singapore. You just have to suck it up. Just din't forget the white immigration card you got on arrival at Changi.All in all a long but good day was had.",4.0
1302,Had a blast but park needs a fresh coat of paint,"We really had a fun day at Legoland theme park. Our 6 years old was thrilled to go on every single ride on the park. There was no Q on any of the rides, which made it much more enjoyable. It was really hot so don't forget to slather on sunblock and put on your hats and sunnies. In my opinion this park is perfect for 6-10 years old. Kids older than that might find it unchallenging enough for them. It can get really hot during the day, just be sure to find indoor attractions to cool down and relieve yourself from the heat. The food inside the park was good and reasonably priced (for a theme park wise). We tried the pizza place near duplo land, it was pretty good. Signs of wear and tear are starting to show here and there. The sun surely did a lot of damage in bleaching the colors of those legos. Still I had expected a much better maintenance for it. There was 1 ride that we didn't go on to because it was under maintenance. Hopefully everything will be up and running soon. Staffs were helpful and courteous. They would interact with the kids and made sure that children are enjoying themselves. The park itself is clean. We enjoyed ourselves and had a great experience. ",5.0
1303,"Ok, but not really suitable for under 6's","We made a day trip from KL to visit the park, luckily that Wednesday coincided with a really quiet day at the theme park, so we didn't have to wait for any rides at all.The Lego character visit to the main restaurant at 1pm was a highlight for our son.There were not as many rides and attractions as we hoped for our 4 year old son. He did enjoy the Junior Cars, Boats and Planes though.  I know a lot of adults who like Lego want to visit, but I wouldn't recommend it for them either, there is not much for the over 12's.  It definitely wasn't worth the flight ticket prices / taxis / entrance fees just to come for the day, it should only really be something you do if you are already in Johor Bahru for something other reason or event.Definitely get a voucher in advance to get the price down (either from LegoLand itself or My Fave or similar).",3.0
1304,Good for kids,Ensure your kids are 8 or you'll miss most rides...lots of play area..can spend a whole day for kids sake...clean...but bathrooms need attention..locker facilities expensive,3.0
1305,Trip to legoland,Firstly would like to say if u family with kids pls book for 2 days as there are 2 parks 1 wet pls don't forget to carry your own towels otherwise u will have to pay 60 myr for 1towel.in wet park only. Otherwise there is lots too do in dry park with activities and rides pls don't miss any roller coasters they r fun but mind it the height limit is 110 cms for kids so be aware of the same. But a fun place to spend time with family,5.0
1306,Little Disappointed with the overall maintenance,An interesting place but not well maintained and a good reason for me to doubt the level of safety in which the facilities were offered. Staff needs training and skiving was easily observable. The theme park has a good concept but the overall service and maintenance definitely need a good relook. Sadly one of the worst legolands I have been to.,5.0
1307,HAPPENING!!!!,"The kids really enjoy.. staying 4X at the Legoland Hotel even we are staying in JB. We understand that there will be a new room called Ninja Go will be launch at June 2017, maybe. Definitely will came again.",5.0
1308,Still an awesome experience,"The first time we went to Legoland was on 2015 and we stayed at Legoland Hotel for four days. We were impressed by the park, the hotel and the staff and the kid loved it so we went back again on March 2016 and the latest was May 2017. The experience is still awesome and we are planning another trip for 2018.For each of our stay, we were able to experience the different themed rooms(pirate, kingdom and adventure). These rooms are clean, well appointed, spacious and really attractive to kids. The wifi and the amenities are good. it is regularly and thoroughly cleaned and resupplied by the hotel. The air conditioning is also good.Breakfast in the hotel is also superb. I would say that that legoland breakfast is one of the best breakfast Ive ever been to. Sometimes you would just like to linger around so you can taste everything. The statff attending to the diners are also nice and friendly and some even remembered us from our very first stay.Overall, leogoland(hotel, park and waterpark) was an awesome experience not just for the kids but for the adults as well. As for the price, some would find the hotel expensive but for us, it is good value for our money and would go back to this place again.I would like to commend the hotel management and staff for doing a good job of caring for its customers. Kudos!!",5.0
1309,Everything is awesome!,"Visited Legoland in Malaysia for 3 nights during early May and overall it was a terrific holiday for both the kids and adults. We stayed at the Legoland Resort in a family room with a Pirate theme. The kids loved the room and the hotel got a bigs thumbs up from them, especially the disco themed elevators which were a highlight on their own! We purchased a package which included accommodation and theme park entrance for each day, which accessed both the waterpark and the theme park. The rides were enjoyable for both adults and kids as were the numerous activities Lego activities that the theme parks offered each day. We enjoyed so much, that we bought annual membership which provides entrance to the theme parks and discounts on the hotel and Lego purchases, and have already booked our return in October. Would definitely recommend to families with young children and your kids will think your awesome!",5.0
1310,Dec 2016 Family Vacation,"Legoland hotel is family friendly. We choose Pirate Theme Family rooms with king size bed & double-deck bed with pull-out bed good for 3 kids/teenage/adults but unfortunately the beds were not comfortable, were hard & we had backache.On Day 1 we arrived ard 11am & before check-in time @3pm left our luggage at the storage counter. Remember to pack your wet suite separately. Change into out wet suite & head down to the waterpark & spent the rest of the day swimming, sliding, rafting & drifting ourself by the lazy riverpool. After check-in into our rooms & freshing up. We walk to a nearby Mall for Dinner at Old Town Cafe. Walk around abit as there were mini bazaar.Day 2Breakfast was good spread. Will spoilt for choices. Checked-out 12noon, with our luggage to the storage counter again & this time we head to the Theme park. Spend the whole day till closing time. Yeah!! 2D1N is more than enough!Overall a good family time spend together.",3.0
1311,Awesome,"Loved it.  Kids loved it.  Best buffet dinner I've ever had (worth the $$). Awesome rides.  Very clean grounds in good order.  The pirate themed room was great.  Food and drinks somewhat expensive. Friendly, helpful staff.  Kids will remember it forever.  $6 Australian dollars for an Uber from Johar CBD.  Recommended. ",5.0
1312,Awesome Amusement Park,"Visited in the begining of this May with my wife and daughter. This trip made specially for my daughter. It has lots of amusement choices. Ticket price is RM196 for adults and RM153 for child above 3 yo. If you buy online, you can get RM40 cheaper per each.You will need to bring both raincoat/umbrella (if it rains) and sunblock. Its very hot during daylight. At 2PM is the hottest of all.At the theme park, there were indoor and outdoor activities. You may decide first what you want to play before going there by browsing their website and download the map. Why? Because they only open 8hours from 10AM-6PM during weekdays and until 7PM during weekend. I am affraid, you cannot enter all the amusements.We went there on Monday, not all eating stations open. Only Burger Junction that open when we went there.All of the statues there were made purely from Lego bricks! Especially at the Miniland section. All are made from Lego! Awesome!!",5.0
1313,The Legoland in South East Asia!,"Lego fans, look no further for a theme park full with Legos and rides. Many rides now available compared to when it was first opened.Tips:Park is usually opened early and guests are allowed to enter the park before the official opening times, though rides won‚Äôt start until the official opening time. Be there early!Do note that the waterpark and the legoland are separated.Suggestion:It will be great to have a Lego Star Wars ride, there is a Star Wars miniland but a ride will be great!",5.0
1314,Best place for kids,The place is quite far but worth the wait.  People are accommodating.  you need to bring extra clothes so if you decide to have swimming.  And of course don't forget to bring sunscreen.  Surely kids will like it there and of course to the those lego fanatics.,4.0
1315,Great & fun park,"Went there last 2015 with my family. Awesome & happening!!! Good & friendly staff.Be prepared if there is raining time (umbrella or rain jacket). For kids under 4years, better to bring their stroller or maybe baby carrier due to there are long way to go, afraid they might tired or fall asleepThere are a lot of food outlet or stall. Recommended their Pizza Mania. Overall was good & very recommended place to go.",4.0
1316,Outing with young grandchildren,"My son and my daughter in-law wanted to take their children for family trip to Legoland. The have three young children - 5 years and 3 years and 10 month old. They need an extra hand either to accompany the elder two boys to go got thr ride or to hold the youngest, who obviously cannot go on any of the ride. My wife and I joined them to lend our hand. We spent a day at the park and another day at the water park. Our weather is hot and humid. We need to plan the outing at the theme park, especially with children in the group. Good thing for the visitors, though not the park proprietor, there is no crowd at any of the ride on weekdays.We have been to several theme parks abroad - Disneyland, Universal Studio, Sea World, Knotts Berry Farm in several places. Judging by the rides, Legoland appears to be targeted for family with children. For adrenalin junkies, Legoland will probably not stimulating enough.Nonetheless, we spent the whole day going about leisurely at the theme park. On the second day we spent a little more than half a day at the Waterpark. There are nit that many rides compared to the Legoland Park. With very thin crowd, we did multiple yrips on the activities available. All in all, it was good time spent with the family.",4.0
1317,Fun,"Went to Legoland on 8 May, it was a fun experience though I have to say the roller coaster rides are not as scary as I thought - suitable for kids. Ninja-Go is a new attraction at the theme park, kids could enjoy competing ninja chop-chop with the siblings or friends. There Star Wars studio is awesome as well, lots of Star Wars mini-lands in it. Highly recommended to visit with kids. ",4.0
1318,"Great fun place, excellent rides","Legoland was great fun for the family. Excellent rides with safety measures in place. The water park next door was loads of fun too, and helped cool off during the hot afternoons. Was good to see that the staff stick their guns to their age / height etc safety requirements. The entry is free for under 3s at Legoland - i would think this is because those under 3 year cannot sit in many of the rides.",5.0
1319,A place that everybody should define go!!!,"I went there in 2014. The place was awesome!! If you're a good photographer, you can take beautiful shots here! The water slide is must! Not forgetting the roller coaster!!",5.0
1320,Water Park and amusement park ,"The amusement park and the water park both are done very thoughtfully. We have spent 2 days in the park but it can be done in 1 day also. The water park has 4 rides and a wave pool. The amusement park has lot of activities like toy train ride, driving school, boat ride, airport and lot of roller coaster rides. The kids really love the place. The park has enough no of eateries inside. Very well maintained place. Not very crowded place like Disneyland. They have lot of shops inside the park for buying lego toys and moments. Should be visited once with kids.",5.0
1321,Always a fun experience!,This is our first visit to Legoland Malaysia and 3 rd over....we've visited the one in Denmark twice before. Legoland Malaysia is much bigger than Denmark but both are equally good!,5.0
1322,Hours of Fun!!,a very beautiful place full with Lego characters and miniatures. All the rides are scaredycat-friendly and some of it very edutaining too..,5.0
1323,Great even for Big Kids,"Myself and my partner recently visited on a Friday and we had a fab day. Yes the park is mostly catered for younger children, however, even as two adults we had a lot of fun. There are some nice rides even for adults to enjoy and the displays and themed areas are lovely to walk around. We also joined in some of the lego activities and had a blast! The park is very quiet so you can get on all the rides straight away and we even stayed on some of the rides for a few turns.We also went to the water park as well and we had lots of fun. There was a good selection of slides that were pretty fun and the lazy river was very nice!Overall, we had a fab day and would certainly recommend for adults too!",5.0
1324,"Not crowded at all, even on Sunday","Finished all rides within 5 hours and the longest queue we waited in was less than 10 minutes. Rides are good for young kids and Lego lovers. Didn't do the adjacent water park but heard it is quite fun for kids as well. If you drive in, follow more on the road signs than Google map. The map is accurate but apparently some roads are closed, which Google is not informed.",4.0
1325,2 days if you want to enjoy!,"We were skeptical to buy the 2 days pass BUT can only advise if you want to take a nice, stressfree holiday, you will need 2 days to enjoy the parks. The WaterPark is indeed the star for us (even our 18 months baby!). Truly recommended",5.0
1326,Great theme park,"The theme park itself is great and lots of attractions. The only downside of Legoland is its weather which I know is beyond anyone's control. The thing is, once it rains and it always rains in Legoland according to the staff that we spoke to, they close all the rides and the water park for safety purposes. I hope they can somehow add a canopy or something so that you can still go around the theme park even if it's raining hard or extend their operating hours so that you can get your money's worth. The theme park is open from 10am-7pm and the water park closes at 6pm, it rained for 3 hrs when we visited and they closed the rides since it was raining hard. Even if you're wearing ponchos and using umbrellas you'll still get wet and won't be able to ride. Tip: if you really want to go to Legoland, it's better to stay in a nearby hotel or drive from SG and not KL. We drove for 4 hrs from KL, arrived in Legoland around lunch time spent 3hrs going around the places that are not closed due to the rain. Drove back to KL for another 4hrs. It's really not worth the trip coming from KL, from what we're told by the staff, always expect rain in Legoland. ",2.0
1327,Good Experience !!,first visited Legoland back in May 2013. it was fun and good experience for me as i used to play lego toys during my childhood. Visited again back in last year.Facilities and environments are well maintained and staffs are eager to assist.Recommended for a weekend family outing.,4.0
1328,Good outing but could be better,"Went early after breakfast at the Legoland Hotel. Surprised wasn't too crowded given that it's the school holidays. The rides were a lot of fun, although I have to say was expecting better. Honestly, not much different from what you'd get at regular theme parks e.g. Sunway Lagoon. Went to the water park the next day and was also kind of underwhelming. No real 'wow' factor there for both theme parks. Ninjago The Ride is the newest attraction but didn't really enjoy it that much. Compared to Universal Studios S'pore, i think it would be better take a trip across the Causeway.",3.0
1329,Very nice!!!,"Our vacation to Legoland is started with a great transfer from Singapore Airport.The hotel does not look like a 5 star resort is nice but is like a big dormitory.Our room was nice and my son enjoy a lot.... Breakfast is ok....you have s lot of choose.Price for stay there in my personal opinion is very high for the activity they provide...The staff was extremely friendly.The Legoland Park is fantastic and also the Waterpark if you are Lego lovers.... We bought a "" VIP Expedition"" was very cool especially  have lunch with a Lego police character...but we suggest to buy that in a weekend when  there are more people and you can really use for skip the line....",4.0
1330,An awesome place that the kids L-O-V-E-D,"Lego, Lego, Lego.....it's everywhere.Great attractions. Visit it on a non-holiday or a weekday in order to make sure that you don't wait long times in lines. Stay at the hotel and you get let in half an hour early as well. Kids went on many rides twice and had a great time. Got a Drivers Licence (which they still wear) and had a great time. Have seen other comments about food and cost and lack of choices, but on the second day, got 5 nuggets and chips, a soft drink and an ice-cream as a combo for 20RM (about NZD$7). That's incredibly reasonable in my view for a captive market food outlet.",5.0
1331,"Good for Lego mania, need some updating","We visited here because we are lego mania. It was so nice to see everything made by lego, especially Miniland. But we've found out that some of the attraction needs some maintenance. Don't forget to use hat, because it is very hot. ",4.0
1332,PLAY WELL - haven for younger kids,"This is the second time we have been to Legoland in the last year back in Jan 2017 as first time. We had super fun so we decided to buy the annual membership, this is because we paid for a 2 day combo with the theme and water park. So the offer is to then pay for the remainder for the cost of annual membership, so by the second visit its worth getting.Both times we visited there were no or little queue, the longest was about 10mins or so. The park opens at 10am and closes at 6pm. Majority of the park rides are more focused on younger kids 10yrs and less, there are roller coasters however there are only a few. If your child likes building Lego recommed to head to the academy first (turn left - anti clockwise) into theme park. Once there ask for their programs for the day, also you can ask for show times and programs so we can really arrange your day. If it does start raining there are plenty of places where you can duck in such as the movie, there are 4 shows and also the new Ninjago show. Food options are good both Western and Asian are provided,  prices are reasonable - note you cannot take food into the park. Shopping: amazing if you are Lego crazy, all new model and old is available. Also do go to the brickshop and get any individual piece you need. TIP: use your annual pass for all purchase made in Legoland, only 10% but great if you are buying lots of purchases. ",5.0
1333,Good fun park but could do with updating,"I travelled across the border from Singapore as I thought I ought to try the park given its proximity.  Overall the park itself was OK - we all enjoyed it.  Rides were good and we didn't have to queue for ages.  The park is a little worn though and could do with some updating.  E-tickets have to be booked online 7 days in advance on the official website, which is a bit pointless.  Food was not attractive (but they won't let you bring your own in to the park).  Parking was a bit tedious also.  They say you can pay with the Malaysian touch and go card that you had to purchase to drive to the place to start with, but it doesn't work at the single exit (which isn't manned and the help button doesn't work) so you have to reverse up and walk back to the park to pay in cash for a ticket.  If you are driving from Singapore its an easy 45 minute drive there (though remember you need Malaysian currency to purchase the touch and go card to get through immigration - there is no ATM around and the ""officials"" give you an exchange rate of 1:1 - corruption is a byword!).  However, the drive back is pretty shocking.  It took us over 2.5 hours and that (I believe) is good.  I am not sure that the park is worth sitting in a car queuing for that long to be honest.",3.0
1334,Only recommended for Lego fans,"We took a day trip to LL with young kids who like legos just as much as other toys. Except for couple of rides - which were not unique to LL - there was nothing attractive for the kids. To be fair to this place, we had visited Universal studios Singapore on the previous day and found LL below average in overall appeal. While the staff was friendly , some of them were ill informed about show timings. The Star Wars show was a short movie screening (not even 3D !!) in a small room - most of us were waiting to leave. The 4D movie experience in Miniland was no comparison to the Shrek experience at Universal. Small lego workshops kept the kids busy but again nothing extra ordinary. The miniature city was beautiful but would have been amazing if the kids were allowed an opportunity to walk through. Overall, we were not impressed with the amusement park. Would recommend the waterpark which atleast would be a good respite in the humidity. ",3.0
1335,Good theme park for children but not for adult :),"This theme park is very huge and really good for children, but for me, it was really boring. The souvenir store look like heaven for lego  fans, because all product is lego.",4.0
1336,Good amusement park for children,"All made from lego. My kids really enjoy. As for me, I enjoy the Ninjago Ride and 4D movies.Most important thing is the praying room is available and clean, the toilets (with water hose) also clean and available in every corner.The price is norma, not too expensive nor too cheap.Its a good experience for us.",4.0
1337,Great for young children ,"Spent all day at the theme park and did most of the rides suitable for our 5 year old. Glad we did not buy tickets to waterpark as one day is not enough to complete both parks. We went on the Sunday before Labour Day Monday, and it wasn't too crowded. 20 min queue for popular rides, some shorter. Later in the evening the crowd lessened and there were hardly any queues! Ample restaurants, food stalls and shops. Bring a hat! ",4.0

1339,A great theme park n disable friendly,"Went there with my sister n mother in her wheelchair. We bought the combo ticket which covered theme park n water park. Love all the attractions n facilities as they are disable people friendly. Staff were friendly n helpful with my mother. Food can be pricey which is typical for theme parks everywhere. Variety of rides to suit all ages, the rollercoasters  can be thrilling for adults too. Moderate level in my opinion.Water park slides also the same experience with the theme park, except one slide was closed at that time for maintenance. We purposely went during weekday to avoid the crowd so our experience was pleasant. We didn't feel short of time even though we covered both parks in a day due to the lack of crowd. Nothing to complaint. Even my mother was able to enjoy rides that were disable friendly which u can find out more on the map.Overall we had an enjoyable time n would love to come again. ",5.0

1342,Perfect for a family with little children day oit,"This was our second time visiting Legoland.Better visit during working day, as for our first time visiting on a Saturday the place was really packed.They really put attention on small details to make the experience enjoyable as there were family toilet in every toilet section, they have kids meal option in almost all restaurant, and also the price was reasonable.Just make sure to bring hat/umbrella and apply sunscreen as the heat was unbearable.",5.0
1343,Fun day out,Had a fun day at the Water Park and Legoland. Thought there was more to do together for my 6 year old and myself as compared to say USS. Think it will be a good idea to purchase the tickets online as there is a long queue (easily an hour wait) on the day I went.,4.0
1344,Theme and water parks,"both parks considered kids very well in terms of its rides. If you are an adult, don't expect any sort of heart-attack rides. There is none. Best price if you purchase the ticket for both parks on their website, much cheaper. Also you have option during the day itself to upgrade for a premium pass which comes with its perks for a fee. During the visit, there were lots of people. However if you plan to go for both in morning, you should go to the water park first as usually there will not be long queues compared with the theme park. Then, towards afternoon you can proceed for the theme park. The place has prayer room for muslims, toilets, and restaurants. It's noteworthy to highlight that during my visit, the toilets were so clean and dried, good for local standards. However i was a tad upset when I ordered my lunch, she didn't inform me that they run out of a few condiments for what i ordered. They only told me after the food was ready. Well at least some gestures of sorry or replace it with other things. Hence, I deducted one star for the rating. ",4.0
1345,Having Fun at Legoland,"I went to legoland, johor baru with my son 4.5 years old as he loves lego so much. We had the best day, it wasn't busy as how usually other theme par is, the qeue was less then 2 mins in each ride.There were lots of ride for young chidren starting from age 3 to enjoy. Also there are roller coaster for big kids starting age 6 i think. Adult also can accompany the little one the ride. So everyone in the family can enjoy the fun.The park is very well maintained and clean.Food and drink from their restaurant are good and delicious. The lego shop has lots of lego collection and cheaper compare to australia.We were staying at singapore and we hire a car with the driver to go cross the border. It was easy.If anyone looking to entertain the little one while in singapore, go to legolandüëç",5.0

1348,Best theme park in Malaysia,"I am not kidding, Legoland is the hands-down the best in Malaysia. We got the 1-day combo ticket and immediately regretted....there is not enough time to fully experience this place. If you have the time, please get the 2-day combo ticket, which allows you to go back and forth both the theme park and water park. As the other reviews mention...yes, this theme park is open air...there is not much covered walkways. But imho, theme parks are meant to be open air, so that your kids are free to run around and explore all the great fun this park has to offer. There are activities for all ages! Even my 4yo enjoyed Legoland and begged to come back again sometime soon. The rides have both age and height requirement. My 4yo (100cm) went on more than 8 rides and my 6 yo (115cm) went on more than 15 rides. Don't forget to try the new Ninjago ride, it is so awesome that we went 3x.Don't forget to try the food in the park. They serve Lego fries and the food is quite yummy. Price-wise, quite affordable for theme park standard.The water park is equally awesome. I have to admit that Sunway Lagoon has a bigger water park with more extreme rides. Legoland water park is catered to families with young children, where you can build Lego rafts while drifting around in the wave pool - the activity we love the most.The best feature of Legoland is definitely the Legoland crew. All the staff - from entrance counter, theme park to water park - are amazing!!! They are friendly, polite, attentive and even took the time to chat and play with my kids.  Legoland is definitely a must visit place when you come to JB.",5.0
1349,Awesome time spent ,"It is a suitable place for young child, 4-12 years old. Some ridea are suitable for teenagers and adults as well. Make sure your kids are at least 95 cm tall, or 4 years and above to enjoy the park. We didn't spent a dime on inside food because it is rather expensive. Parking was quite far, so we decided to park at Medini Mall, which is CHEAPER and definitely NEARER!We only go for theme park, not the water park.Because we take day ticket, we could not reenter once we exit. And there is a clause: no refund should the weather goes bad. If it rains heavily with thunder, 80% of the rides closed.  So pay attention to weather forecast. We were lucky coz it only rains with thunder at 4pm, nearly closing time. I can't imagine what we feel should the rain camr earlier. It was a quiet day becoz not school holiday or weekend. So there was almost no queue. And yet, we can barely finish all the rides. So, plan your visit properly to truly enjoy the park. Some worthwhile ride esp for adults:Dragon, dragon apprenticeDino islandNinjago ride Project X. Make sure u visit the 4D movie theater as well. The city stage Ninjago theater was enjoyable too (though I slept for the whole session bcoz too tired) The facilities were top notch. Toilets were squeaky clean. Enjoy the park!",5.0
1350,Great place for Lego fan,1st time to Legoland and this was great fun. Got 2 day ticket so try out both water park and legoland. Only 1hr from Singapore.Go during the week so wasn't much crowd. Ninjago ride was great. Kids tried that out several times. The Ninjago show was excellent. Very well done. A couple of rides were closed when we were there and the playground near Egypt land was mediocre. Ball guns didn't work and quite worn out. Waterpark is great to cool down at end of day.Overall good experience but could have been better.,4.0
1351,Go only for kids,"Need to look at this theme park only from Lego blocks and kids perspective if you have visited many other large theme parks. Water park is good but would've liked more number of rides and thrills but I can understand if its meant only for kids. The main theme park is just ok - better to lower your expectations and come here only for Kids and their love for lego. The miniland is the best here - where they have built miniatures using lego blocks of famous east asian structures like Taj Mahal, Ankorwat etc.. Worth visiting this place if you are to go through the hassles of MY visa and only if you are planning to stay in the Legoland hotel.",3.0
1352,"Good fun with the rides, Kids love it. Only themed park from 11:30am to 5:30pm","Ticket price is something that can be debatable, 2 Adults and 2 kids with Maybank promotion, end up at RM490 (April 2017). However the choices for kids are immense. Even after 6 hours, kids still want few other things. I think the park is not crowded even during long weekend (Came on Sunday), hence the waiting time is less. The ride is ok if you have kids at 6 years old and above, so they can fully utilized. The dino boat ride, Castle ride, Techno Car ride and Ninjago ride is a must. It gives experiences to the kid to interact  such as Ninjago, work as team to score points. Foodwise, plenty of options. We were lucky that we are having gloomy day. Can't imagine if the sun is out and shinning. Take note if it is thunderstorm you will loose 80% of park attractions. I think family with kids should start to the left side from entrance, where attractions are free and easy (boat ride, train ride etc) before going for hay wire extreme down the roller coaster. Take note some ride might be wet, as we found out. It can be very wet or skinny dimple wet. Love it, will definitely come back if there is new attractions ride.",4.0
1353,GREAT PLACE FOR FAMILY FUN,"very attractive something different form universal studio, kids get all rides that they wanted to ,great food court all over the parks .we have so much fun after whole day in theme park .lucky not heavy crowds on this weekend so that no long queue for rides plus my son keep return for 2nd rides especially x project and the roller coaster.",5.0

1355,Great for children - just 1 hour trip from Sentosa,"We went to Legoland recently with our boys (7 and 6 years). Thankfully we went on a Monday and the park was rather lightly visited - which was very nice as there were no wait times at any of the attractions.The attractions are well suited for younger children and that really had great day (especially the ""driving school""), but do not expect anything special for teenagers or adults.Getting there is relatively easy (we booked a car shuttle through the hotel).",5.0
1356,Great fun for all of the famly,"LEGOLAND contains lots of rides, and really caters to the 3-12 years old age group extremely well.

You really need a full day to get around the park, and if you also have a waterpark pass I would do that on the second day. The park has lots of food and drink stands and there is quite a bit of choice which makes it easier for families.",5.0
1357,Great short holiday,"Great place for kids below 12 and those adults fearful of fast & furious rides. Children can think while they play , especially the Lego playroom. The rides are enjoyable, fun without giving you a heart attack. No queue at all, able to finish all rides within 2 and half hours. Kids love it!",4.0
1358,Awesome day out,"I would recommend this trip to anyone even couples with no children will love this tourist attraction. I took my 12 year old son and my mum. What a fun day we had. I would recommend wearing swimmers or taking some with you and a towel as you do get wet on a couple of the rides plus there is also a separate water park if you get time to visit it. The new Ninjago ride was good fun, my son went back 3 times. ",5.0
1359,Every Kid's DREAM!,"Been there 2 times and girls are still asking to be brought there. Everything is so LEGO here and not just the girls, even adults are excited over the whole place. From the lobby to the elevators to the room! This is simply every kid's DREAM!",4.0
1360,Place is for kids,"My 10 year old son had a great time, however, there are not enough activities for grown ups. Some areas are not well maintained (like 4D)",5.0
1361,Overrated,"We decided to go to the water park only as our girls aren't really into Lego or thrill rides. The entrance fee for the waterpark was exorbitant. I was extremely irate at the ticket lady saying ""today will rain and just for you this ticket you can't come back in once you go out""- why just for me?! What deals do other people get? Once you head in there's plenty of lockers and towels you can hire. The paths can get quite hot so I would recommend wearing your thongs around the park, and storing them on their little round shoe racks at the different sections. Unlike most other water parks, they don't have electronic wristbands for you to load cash onto, so just be mindful that you will have to go back and forth to your locker if you need $. I went with a 4yo and 6yo and my 4yo was unfortunately too short for many of the ""cooler"" slides, which was another reason for me to be peeved about the entry price. We spend the majority of the time at the Joker Soaker section. They loved the slides there but HATED the bucket that filled and heavily poured quite frequently. The wave pool was also a hit, but that was really all there was at the waterpark. There's only one place you can buy food, which was average and not cheap. We only spent 3 hours there and won't be back unless bribed, or until my youngest child is at least 107cm tall, whichever comes first. ",2.0
1362,Disappointing Legoland,Immigration from Singapore was slow and took forever- Legoland is near the border of Malaysia and Singapore though.  Legoland is HOT! Hardly any shade and since its in the tropics- prepare for rain. Bring lots of sunblock and umbrellas and ponchos.  The rides and attractions are not so exciting.  AND- the just getting into and thru Singapore immigration took 2 hours.  ,3.0
1363,Love this place,"This is so good for the kids, it's never crowded, the rides are appropriate for young children. The fans are awesome throughout the park they provide a great breeze. It's just amazing how all the statues are built out of Lego. We bought an Annual Pass last year so saved us quite a bit of money and it allowed us to walk in and out when we wanted. Food is reasonable and there is so much Lego to buy! ",5.0

1365,Getting dated.  Not worth the trip.,"I'm reviewing this as a traveller from Singapore to Legoland JB.  After visiting Kidzania Singapore on the same week, you can't help but to compare the experience with Legoland JB.  Legoland feels dated, and/or poorly maintained.  The chair i was sitting on in the '4D' experience was slightly broken.  That was after shifting one seat because the other chair had a large stain on it.  Some of the seats on other rides had tears in the seats too.  Wear and tear I understand, but maintenance should be fixing these issues, considering the high price.For 1 adult and 2 kids, it was around 500RM excluding the cost (and long commute) to get to Legoland JB.  That's substantially higher than Kidzania that was much easier to get to from Singapore.  Food was appallingly expensive.  A few chicken pieces and lego fries with a drink for RM27, and it wasn't good.  At the big shop, the lego I noticed were more expensive too.  I saw a set that was around 160SGD where you could find it outside for 120SGD.The kids enjoyed their day though.  The best part about legoland is that there's just not many people (not that it makes service better).  We went on the Technic ride 7 times and the Dragon ride 5 times because there was no queue.  Even the staff parking had more cars than the customer carpark.  Makes you wonder how long it'll remain in operation.So overall, the kids enjoyed it ONCE they got to the park.  However, is it a worthwhile trip?  Not when you consider the commute, the high price of entry, the expensive and poor food, and overall poor maintenance of this branded theme park.",3.0
1366,Nice themepark,"Nice themepark in malaysia. Full tematic with lego, very nice if you have kids under 12 years old. Usual attractions, never compare with universal singapore. Not many visitor so don't buy hero pass. Very hot but suddenly can change into heavy rain",4.0
1367,Legoland Malaysia,"We travelled as a family of 4 from Singapore via private transfer. It was about double the price of the tour bus but was a door to door service. The best part about the private transfer was going through customs. We didn't need to get out of the car and it we were through the border in about 10-15 mins.The shops around Legoland are ordinary. Previous posts I read talked about food options. There was a Thai restaurant, KFC and Burger King. Only cash could be used which we were not prepared for as we only took minimal Malaysian money.Legoland was pretty good though. It was pretty deserted the day we went. (A Thursday). We did a whole day 10-6pm and it was plenty of time to go on most rides and spend a few hours at the water park. Kids loved it so it was worth the trip. Would recommend as a day trip from Singapore. It's only a 45 min drive with no traffic. We got traffic coming home, took 1 hour and 10.",4.0
1368,Great time had at Legoland,"Mainly geared towards kids, I was pleasantly surprised at how much fun I had as a 37 year old male. There were rides for adults as well and the Lego sculptures were great. Plenty to do and queues were small so plenty of rides throughout the two days. Started at the Legoland hotel as well which is easy to find and great fun for the kids. ",4.0
1369,Great place but may not be worth the hassle of the travel,Let me start with the fact that Legoland is great and has multiple things to do for kids of different ages. We loved it and will probably go back but will stay there next time.We attempted the trip from the Singapore flyer as I had been there before and although the trip was longer than I would like it was bearable. If you caught the bus without the checkpoints it would probably take you about 45 minutes. Unfortunately though you have to go through one of the most inefficient border checks I have experienced. It took us 2-3 hours to get from the flyer to the entrance of Legoland and a similar amount on the way home. Waiting in line for 45 minutes with three kids is not a fun way to spend your time. Neither is sitting in the bus in queue for an hour or so.Go to Legoland but plan to stay there if you want to see the whole park.,4.0
1370,Amazing On A Weekday ,"No waiting queues, great staff that really try to entertain the children. The rides are nice for small children, especially the new Ninjago.

1374,Run down and not very exciting...,We went on a tour bus. After the process of going through 2 lots of immigration each way didnt think this was worth a whole day out of trip. Left our hotel at 745am and didnt get back til 7pm. Legoland itself was empty apart from the few buses that were there. Not a single car in the massive car park. Needless to say though no queues which was nice as it was really hot! However this park is aimed at little ones under 10. We found that we got through the whole park in an hour and was stuck there for 4 hours as we had to wait for the bus back.... a very long day for very little fun. But if you have little one that go nuts for lego then maybe its worth it..... ,2.0
1375,Legoland experience,"Booked tickets online in advance. Arrived at Legoland around 10am on a sunny Sunday morning.  Walked about 5-10 minutes from the car park to the entrance. Took a few photos in front of Legoland. First thing to do was to the driving school for the ride. Then the boat ride not far away. Queued for about 15 minutes for those rides.  Even though it was Sunday, there was not many people as expected.  Train ride was another thing to do on the list.  NinjaGo 4D ride was fun. Ended the visit earlier than planned as everyone was tire and sweat. Walked to Legoland hotel to checked out the hotel which cost double the price of the hotel we booked.  Lots of Lego for the kids to play at the lobby.",4.0
1376,Nice place for famillies,"Although they do have new attractions every year (currently, it is Star Wars), the overall maintenance of the Theme Park could be improved.The Water Park is a great place for kids.For both parks, if possible, avoid going there during holidays and weekends. The crowd will be too big for you to enjoy yourselves.",4.0
1377,Sad to see the state that Legoland has fallen to,"All I can say is that this place has gone down a lot since the last time we visited. Lots of things don't work and it doesn't look like they're planning to fix it any time soon. Ride maintenance is a given so I understand if something is down for maintenance but it doesn't look like they even care to maintain the place. If I were LEGO HQ, I'd be utterly horrified to see the standard that this place has dropped to.The park officially opens at 10am but most of the rides aren't open until 10:30 because they are still doing their ""test runs"". One would think that if the park opens at 10am, all this should have been done before opening time so that it would be ready when your customers arrive.",2.0

They have a variety of activities (rides, food stalls, exhibits, etc.) which you can enjoy all day long. The most fun part here though is their Star Wars section where you can find all key events in every Star Wars episode displayed artistically in separate rooms and complete with sound and light effects. The rides were also great and the staff were always very accommodating. Although one should wear sunblock here because there are no covers and most of the time, the sun is hot and up in the sky. But all in all, a great experience.",5.0
1380,Not as good as last time ,"Not having any vouchers or valid credit cards had to pay full price for 2 adults and 1 child for both parks. Nearly 700myr to start the day.Get inside the water park to ride down for maintenance and long queue for the other rides.Went next door and again found rides under maintenance that included waterflume, new ride not even sure what it was called, observation tower, jet ski ride. Two of the rollercoasters were operating but at max 50% occupancy due to rain earlier in the day.A fun day but not really value for money",3.0
1381,Good fun for kids,"Visited the park with another family. Most rides are meant for kids above 3 years old and above 1m in height. We think it is ideal for kids above 4 years old. Don't expect too much from food at the theme park though! The staff level of English is basic, if you need further assistance, approach one of their more senior staff.Weather here can be really quite hot and humid. Bring an umbrella or sun hat. And when it rains there is little that people can do. ",4.0

1383,All you need to know to drive to Legoland from Singapore & love the place,"Legoland is a great place to visit for kids and adults both as the rides are good for all ages. It is also impressive to see the creativity around using lego blocks for everything. We also attended a Lego Mind Storms workshop which was very good. Please register early for it to avoid disappointment.If you are driving from Singapore to Legoland, please take note of the following:1) On a normal working day, it took us around 1.5 hour to reach Legoland from East Singapore. 2) Carry your passport and make sure you have a Malaysia Visa if you need one3) You must carry the following in your car --> Car registration details, Paper to show road tax is valid as LTA is no longer issuing road tax discs, Insurance Papers.4) Toll charges etc :a) Singapore immigration will charge S$3.50 each time you pass through Tuas (Total S$7)b) Malaysia Immigration charges RM20 on entry from Singapore. YOU MUST USE A ""TOUCH n GO"" CARD which you can buy earlier or at the checkpointc) Malaysia Toll Road charges are RM 7.50 on both ways which you pay using Touch n GO card also. ( Total RM 15 for a round trip)You can park at the open carpark. As there are lot of discussions around safety of car, we decided to park at the Legoland Hotel car park which costs RM50 which can paid at the hotel lobby.Vegetarian food options are limited - you can get a vegetarian Pizza at PizzaMania.Get a raincoat or poncho as there is a chance of getting wet in some rides",4.0
1384,Fun fun fun ,We love coming here & have been back continuously. I still find that the team here maintains warmth and friendliness and are fair.

1387,Kids love it,"We went last Saturday with 2 boys aged 4-7 years old.It was raining that morning so we started off with Wet Park.  Please buy/bring something to protect your phones/money if you intend to bring them around in the Wet Park.  I just brought a ziplock bag-used 2 of it just in case the outer one leaks! But was a hassle to bring them around.  OR you could buy them in the Legoland store in the Wet Park for RM100++.  Did not want to buy it because I wouldn't be using it anymore.  I think I would just leave them in the locker next time so I don't have to worry all the time. They have lockers (RM20 for small ones - enough to fit backpack and some more stuffs).  Bring your own towel though if you don't want to spend unnecessarily.If you want to try on the water slides, then recommended to wear a non-cotton shirt as they are some slides which requires you to take them off if they are of cotton - mentioned by the men responsible for each games.  But safe to say any shirt which are not meant for swimming will be asked to be taken off (especially those slides which will have your shirt to be in contact with the slides).  My 7 year old can play most of the games (dry and wet park) but not my 4 years old boy.  So you could measure if your child goes above 102..or 107 cm, then he can play most of them.  But of course they are some games which are tame for them.Food was okay - but expensive.  parking as RM10 per entry but lots of them.  The day I went was on a Saturday and there was no queue!  Parking - plenty!No food allowed - but water bottles yes.  Thank goodness the day was not too hot..it was cloudy..with some drizzles at times.'Staffs were friendly and helpful.",4.0
1388,Great fun for kids and lego fans alike...,"Had a great time at Legoland and the adjoining waterpark with my family of 2 kids.  Overall impression is good.  Rides were well maintained and had a good variety for all ages.  The miniature models of landmark buildings were fantastic.  Star Wars fans will also not be disappointed with the excellent Star Wars display (though I wish there was a Star Wars Themed ride).  Plenty of F&B outlets across the park so the wasnt a risk of over crowding.  Also lots of retail outlets based on theme (e.g. ninjago, nexus knights, etc. ) and 2 lego shops at the entrance.The water park was also very well maintained.  Plenty of lifeguards and staff around to assist.  Slides were excellent too!  Overall, very enjoyable visit.  You can also rent personal gazebos to relax in.A few areas to improve on:1. More fans in common areas, especially the waterpark.  There were no fans placed at all in shaded resting areas except for the F&B outlet.2. Park was rather small.

However, it was so hot that we almost didn't want to go out for the rides but stay inside the cool air conditioned playroom. There was a 4D theater where we're caught unaware that it's going to rain inside. Just imagine, it was super hot outside waiting in a long line and when we finally got in, it was cold and worst it rained inside the theater. It was totally unexpected.

1397,Happy Children,"I took 4 kids aged 8,9,12 and 13. This is about the ""DRY"" theme park...Perfect for the 6-12 age group (even my 13 year old son enjoyed it despite trying not to). Got there in a blue taxi 50RM ($12usd) from our hotel near the ""Woodlands"" checkpoint Johor Side. There are lockers for 40MR ($10usd) for the day. There are big lockers just outside for suitcases -we could fit 3 cabin bags into one. The lockers on the inside are much smaller.Went on a Thursday NOT during the Malaysin school holidays and it was pretty empty. NO QUEUES at all the kids just stayed on the rides over and over. Cost 196RM per adult (12 and over) and a bit less for kids. There are no family passes. It is better value to book on the internet 7 days in advance but I wasn't that organised. Also I would recommend getting the combo pass if you have more time. One day for the dry park and one for the water park. The best thing about the theme park was that my short 8 year old could go on EVERY ride alone height restriction for riding alone is 120cm.There are no super scary rides for adults or big kids but that didn't stop my kids from enjoying themselves.One ride gets you VERY wet. You have to leave your hats and valuables at the start of the ride so best have nothing you want to lose in your bag or take turns in caring for the bags. The body driers are not so efficient for 10MR for about 5 mins. It is VERY hot and there is limited shade but attractions along the way are air-conditioned so it is manageable. TAKE A HAT, you can buy sunscreen in the legoshop at the beginning. Food is not permitted from outside but they let my kids take their water bottles in. You can buy various meals which are edible for around 20RM a meal combo ($5usd).There are buses to the boarder crossing to Singapore from Legoland for about $1usd and then you can take a bus across the causeway for a few RM.",4.0

In addition, the life guards are very attentive and responsive, as a kid fell down when I was there and the lifeguards responses at great time.At the dry park, the rides and games are mainly for kids, nothing to scary.

1401,Legoland Trip ,I brought my 5yrs old son to visit Legoland on 08/04/17 & 09/04/17. We booked the 2 day combo package online. Because Legoland only open at 10am so we actually went 1 day in advance to stay overnight at the nearby hotel (Somerset Medini Iskandar Puteri). It's only 5mins walk to the Legoland. This hotel is much cheaper than Legoland Hotel. And it's up to standard also for the hotel staff and facilities. Hotel provides a free 2hrs late check-out (Subject to availability) so we can spend more time at the Waterpark on the 2nd day without paying for another day. The Waterpark is small but just nice for my 5yrs old son as he will keep on going back to the same slides non stop. And because it's small so you don't need to plan another day for the Waterpark. But the theme park is quite huge. So you will need a full day to enjoy everything. That's the reason we went there 1 day early just to make sure we don't get delayed by the Malaysian Immigration queue or traffic jam. We spend our 1st night at the AEON Bukit Indah Shopping Centre which is not too far away. Did some shopping and have our dinner there after we check in at 3pm on 1st day.,5.0

The coating on the flooring of the pools are all worn out and chipping. Ok for first timers like us, but will not come back unless it will undergo major renovations.For the Legoland Themepark, the manager has to check the staff! Not much security on the area. No person really looking over playgrounds and in fact, some rides/areas are empty. I mean, its open but no one is there to operate! Imagine that! The staff are either just talking among themselves or simply ignoring the people around. They don't explain properly the procedures of the rides. They just let you take the ride and figure out for yourself what will happen next! The lego displays are old but still nice. Food is extremely expensive and doesn't taste good at all! ",3.0

Good things :~ not crowded~ lotsa food choices inside and outside park~ best rides indoor n outdoor~ nice rates offer for season passNot so good : ~ rainy season ~ most outdoor rides in maintenance mode~ pricey food insideOverall it is a very good place to visit as long as the kids are enjoying it and they are very happy. ,4.0
1415,Perfect visit,"Our family (kids 3, 9, 11) had 2 fabulous data at Legoland. We stayed at the hotel and had a 2 day pass included in our stay. It was a reasonable add in price. We spent the mornings at the theme park and then a couple of hours in the afternoon at the water park. A great combination. We were lucky with no rain. The rides were just right for our children. They went in everything between them. The older two were big enough to go on the rollercoasters by themselves which was great. Not too crowded (our school holidays but not theirs). The Lego shops were no cheaper than buying Lego on sale here but more variety. The food was very cheap inside (they inspect bags on the way in so you can't take anything in with you except water). Lots of different options for lunch and snacks.It was quite hot but there are lots of inside activities that are air conditioned too. Plan your day around this.You could do it in one day but there was enough to entertain us for 2 days and it was more relaxing!",5.0
1416,Must go at least once,A visit will remember for sure. Kid friendly and near the 2nd link. A day is not enough there for kids,3.0
1417,Great for the kids!,"Great place to visit for the kids. The water park section was well maintained and the rides section was a fantastic. The Ninjago ride just opened when we visited legoland and it's a ""must ride"". ",4.0
1418,Great waterpark for kids of all ages,"Fun time on all the slides and lots of activities for kids of all ages. Do this first before Legoland as walking around Legoland can get tiring and if it rains, the waterpark closes so tickets will be wasted.",4.0
1419,Ok,"There were 6 of us comprising of 4 adults & 2 young children. We decided to buy the tickets on the same day and the process was rather smooth. One of the ride (Dino something) was out of service on that day, and the observation tower was having issue for a moment but the technician was able to get it back online again 10 minutes.Waiting time for most of the attraction were less than 5 minutes except for the popular boating and driving school.During the visit, I spotted a non local visitor smoking at the non designated smoking area. It is a nuisance to other visitors.The food is okay but the price is a tad on the high side just like other amusement parks...Worth to visit once in your lifetime.Tips: Pay less when you park at Medini Mall on Friday, Saturday, Sunday...RM4/entry compared to Legoland's RM10 and it is nearer to the entrance.",3.0
1420,Went to their wet park,We just went to the wet park . Actually easy access via public transport . You may use uber or piblic bus . It quite cheap compare if you use taxi . ,5.0
1421,Recommended for family with kids,"I went there on weekday because it near to my house. A little bit boring for those who seek for thrill activities. Well, may be I'm too 'big' for those lego.",3.0
1422,Great fun for the whole family!,"As theme parks go, this isn't very big but if your kids are within 4 to 12, they will have a gala time! There are a couple of mild roller coasters for the adults and older kids but most of the rides are for the younger kids. The centerpiece is the replicas of renowned places that have been built entirely from lego bricks. This is very good as it highlights all the main attractions in the region. It is a truly impressive feat.There are quite a few fun fair style rides that families can enjoy together and also some where the parents are required to play with the children like the firefighting game.(This one is tiring for the parent!) However, do note that all the rides require you to be 3 and above with quite a few requiring you to be 4 and above. The park is split into different themed areas so you should take the time to identify how you would want to navigate the park rather than just walk blindly around. There is a car driving academy (electric cars) and a boat ride near the entrance which is a good place to start for younger kids. (I went with a 3 and 4 year old). There are some playgrounds in the park but these aren't really recommended as the rides are more fun. There is a ninjago show that is quite good and a 3D theatre which is a good place to escape from the heat. There is a ride that gives you a laser gun to shoot at targets and gives you a score, kids generally love these kinds of rides and the new ninjago ride. These are fun but the 3 year old was scared of the 3D effects and the darkness, so refused to go for another spin. There is a play area deeper in the park for those below 3. It is covered and fenced off so it is quite safe for the children to run around and there is a short train ride inside as well. There is a star wars area where they have built up all the star wars sets and you can purchase some of them in the shop immediately outside. They show a short clip before letting you in which doesn't really serve much purpose. Dining options are quite limited and pricy, not to mention bad; so if you have an annual pass, you can walk out to the nearby shopping mall for more dining options. Otherwise, if you wish to do so, you can bring in your own food. If you time your visit right, they will have special events going on. They had the lego Batman movie promotion on when I was there and you have the Batman figure walking around for you to take pictures with and additional Batman activities where you can win some merchandise. Their birthday bash is in September I think, so if you plan your trip for then, it should be quite fun with additional things to do and prizes to win. We had ample time to revisit most of the rides and kids will want to go again and again on their favourite ones. Despite it being a school holiday and weekend, we didn't have to queue long for most of the rides. Definitely considering getting the annual pass as my kids really enjoyed themselves. ",5.0
1423,Legoland Waterpark,"We are a family of 2 adults and 2 kids (aged 10 and 7). First time visiting Waterpark. It was a Wed and during the Mar Sch holidays (Singapore). No queue and got cheaper rate as we are annual pass holders.  The place is not big. My kids enjoyed the slides at the children playground, adults can do the same slides too. We felt very safe as there is a staff manning each slide to ensure the next kid only goes down the slide when it is clear. We spent most of our time there. We also did Red Rush as a family, many times. Staff were friendly and helpful. Would have given the place a higher rating but the floor was really scorching hot to go up to do the adult slides.  They should really make some shelter leading to the top and have a system to wear our slippers up and then collect after the slides.  Have to give up to do more slides due to the burning floor.",4.0
1424,LEGOLAND HOTEL,"I mistakenly selected LEGOLAND RESORT when I submitted the review for LEGOLAND and I can't undo my mistake, so this review is for LEGOLAND HOTEL/RESORT.We stayed here only for a night although we were in the vicinity for 5 nights. This was firstly due to the price tag, and secondly as the hotel rooms are of course catered to children, we could not see ourselves staying there for 5 nights even if we could afford it. I do wish though that we had booked a 2-night stay here, and when I wanted to extend my stay, I could not as they were fully-booked. Right across from LEGOLAND Theme Park as all would know, it is about 2 - 3 minutes from the entrance area of the theme park to the door leading to the hotel lifts. It really is convenient to be able to go back to the hotel after a few hours at the park (note though that you will be denied re-entry if you buy a one-day ticket to the theme park or the water park alone, however if you buy a combo ticket, re-entry isn't a problem). My kids, 7 and 10, were so very sad to leave the LEGOLAND world they were in when at the hotel - the room was like nothing they had ever experienced. There were squeals and shrieks from the moment they stepped into the disco lifts. My kids were completely lost in their own world after. They loved their bunk bed and had their own little adventure. I found the room quite small though, thank goodness for the view of the theme park which made the room feel bigger during the day.Good in-house Italian restaurant (but service leaves much to be desired). The pizza was huge and one of the best we ever had (and I‚Äôve been to more Italian pizzerias in my lifetime than I can remember). The tiramisu was lovely, and the kids thoroughly enjoyed the ice cream cake. FANTASTIC breakfast buffet spread at the coffee house. Seriously! The staff were amazing and could cope well with the massive crowd.  The selection was phenomenal. I didn‚Äôt expect much as I assumed the focus would be on the design and theme of the hotel and not the food but the food was an absolute delight. 5 star staff (from reception, concierge to coffee house staff) and great food - it was a truly memorable experience for both kids and adults alike.",5.0
1425,It was fun trip on a sunny day!,"I went to Legoland Malaysia last week bringing my daughter since it's school holidays. We enjoyed the roller coaster ride and my daughter having fun the most. Taking pictures everywhere. However, since my daughter is only 3years old and kind of short, there is not much thing she can play as minimum height for most of the kids rides and games are around 80-120cm(they have the height stick to measure so basically u can't lie on your child age or height) Which most of it my daughter can't involve much aside from taking lots of photos. You might consider bringing your swimming diapers for your children as they charge RM11 for 1 piece of diapers which I found a bit pricy. I am impress with the cleanliness of the toilet. Its very clean and dry.",4.0

1430,Good for younger kids,My sons 8 and 6 enjoyed their time at legoland most of the rides are suitable for their age group. We bought the hero passes which gave us express passes to 7 rides which i found useless as the lines to most of the hero access was not taken care of. When we went in the hero line the staff ignored us we had to keep waving to them and we got rude stares from other people in line. Bring a hat as the weather there is very hot but can change quickly to heavy rain.,4.0
1431,Best to stay in the hotel if traveling with kids!,"Best to stay in the hotel if traveling with kids! We went on day tour from SG and back. Having to go through tight immigration, may consume patience of the kids and the adults! Hotel seems well maintained but the legos inside the theme park appears old, colors are pale. My kid hurt himself trying to open the gate of the small bumper ride. Good thing clinic is near and he was attended to promptly and properly. I still think that the gate should be changed to something safer as the lock is only a small bar a kid can lift himself. Newly opened sites inside the theme park is really nice. It is hot and humid, so wear light clothes! ",4.0
1432,The BEST hotel for family vacation!,"First and foremost when everyone talking about 'Legoland' maybe it is related closely to children.For me this is the right place for whole family to have fun,joy,happiness and close ties relationship among family.This was our second time we came during school holidays and nothing changes since our first trip.Still pretty awesome!Amazing & excellent service greeting especially when we arrived at the hotel the one of short hair BellAtt (Mr Shawal) ask me,'sir do you need any beverage?'Maybe he understood that we had stucked at the traffic jammed from Kl-Jb at least 6hours and im feel a bit exhausted.The new NinjaGo Ride really cool & great with some interactive 4D effect!My kids love it so much.They provided free parking,wifi,luggage store,business centre,swimming pool and everything else that you can feel like your dream home.In short,we would still come again and strongly recommend this to all my beloved friends.All staff are friendly willing to help at all time.The hotel is busy and full of guests but they deliever the service is attentive and down to details.We will come back soon,Thank you.",5.0
1433,Amazing trip,"I was here with my family. We were with 2 young kids and we rent a gazebo nearby the beach area (not sure whats the name of that area). My kids were so happy during that time.

1437,"Enjoyable time, but drink lots of water as weather is too hot","We bought the combo passes to both the theme park and water park so we were able to gain re-entry, We went to the water park in the morning and my kids had fun. Remember to put on sun screen as the sun was quite scorching. After lunch we had a rest in the hotel room before going in the theme park. There was not much crowd on a Thursday so we did not queue for too long for the rides. We spent about 2 hours in the theme park and were not able to cover all the areas. You'll need at least half a day if it gets crowded in the theme park.",4.0
1438,Best Family Hotel and great foods ,"We are from Kuala Lumpur, this is second time we're visiting Legoland Malaysia.It was fantastic experience with full of kids fun area and, the hotel was great and it's like heaven for the kids.We when the Bricks Family restaurant to have our breakfast, the food selection was awesome, so many foods to be try, waffles, nasi lemak, congee with so many condiments , the staffs are very friendly, great smiles in particular the bricks restaurant manager Mr.Syed Ahmad Gadhaffi, take very good care of the costumer and their preference.Overall experience was good, we definitely will be coming back, i will intend to recommend this hotel to my friends!!",5.0
1439,Day out with young children,"Overall, it's a fun day for a family outing but the tickets are too expensive for the very limited rides. Should have more choices of rides. Hopes the Management looks into the bugs flying all over Lego Kingdom. It is so gross and unhygienic. Not sure what bugs are those, but I don't quite like it especially with my kids around. (I was trying to snap a photo of the bugs flying around but can't see). For the train station, maybe the Management should consider putting chairs at one side of the queue line. Young children can't stand for too long. The waterpark and the theme park entrance should not be separated. It is so not convenient. ",4.0

1442,Love! Love! Love!,"Went to both the water themepark and adventure park. Boy oh boy! Let's start with the water themepark, not for those with a weak heart, back pain, pregnant ladies or medically unfit! For every single exciting ride, you have to either go up a flight of stairs or worse, in addition to that carry a gigantic tube or float! I was exhausted! I felt as though im exercising more than experiencing the fun. So if you are interested to come here, make sure you are fit xDDo bring your own towels as they do charge you for rental,  ridiculous i know. If you hate the sun, there's a canopy or gazebo for rental but rather expensive it seems. Adventure theme park! If you don't have much, just go ahead for all the rides. Be prepared to wait for the long queue. Cranky, tired kids will not make the waiting any easier so you have to prepare yourself mentally for that. But i seriously enjoyed all the rides! If you have cash to spare, have a go at the mini stall games and get lucky at winning a prize, it can be a rather huge stuffed toy that you get to bring home! I did! Two of them ^^",5.0
1443,Great But I think its more to the Children,"Legoland JB! A good themepark.. but i think, kids will love it better then adults..

Recommended especially if you bring kids with you, they will LOVE it! (But seriously, sunblock..)",4.0
1444,Great For Younger Kids,My son is Lego Crazy so it was a lot of fun for him the park is designed for Lego enthusiasts and younger children. The rides are nice very suitable for kids from 5 to 12 my son loved the driving School also got his Lego Driving License the restaurant in the dinosaur section had Lego Brick shaped fries vey nice. You can't compare it with Universal Studios or Disneyland but if you have young kids or kids who love Legos you'll have fun. It's not that expensive and not that busy either if ur in the JB area must visit. Try and catch the Ninjago Live show that's really good.,5.0
1445,A Good Theme Park,"With operating hour of 10 AM - 6 PM, on a non-peak day you can expect to try for all the ridez they have.

1450,Such an amazing place,We went to the park on a Monday and it was so quiet and peaceful! We got to go on the rides straight away and then often the operators would let us go again as there was no lines. Great time for the kids! Even our daughter who is not into Lego has so much fun :),5.0
1451,Nice place to be but can be a bit hot. ,"The games here is like a mix of adult and kids, nothing scary except for one rollercoaster near the entrance. Do take the train first to tour the area.

Only dislike is its there is less shade from the sun and can get very hot. Bring lot of water. ",3.0

1453,Expect exhausted kids after a day of fun!,"I've lost count on the number of times my family have visited Legoland Malaysia. We've just renewed our annual passes last Sep for another two years. So, it's no doubt Legoland Malaysia is an awesome place for families to enjoy!There are plenty of rides and activities to do at Legoland for both kids and the young-at-heart. Even the rides cater to the older kids (eg the Dragon, the Lego City riding school) and the young ones (eg the Dragon Apprentice, the junior driving school). Adults would love rides like Project X and Aqua Racers. The latest addition would be the Lego Ninja-Go ride - tiring ride but great fun! Believe we had this ride over 20 times per day of visit!Other than rides, there are plenty of shows / activities to entertain the whole family. The 4D shows, the live shows (now showing Lego Ninja-go), imagination car building , Star Wars lego exhibition and Mindstorms where the older kids learn about robotics.Legoland Malaysia celebrates quite a number of festivities as well as theme events in certain months. Eg, we were there during Halloween last Oct. Other than extended opening hours till 10pm, the entire Legoland was transformed into a 'ghost town', where lego vampires and the creepies strolled in the park. There were also activities such as Halloween night hunt and horror shows! When we were there two weeks ago, they were celebrating the Lego Batman movie. So, there are meet-and-greet sessions with Batman, Bat Scavenger Hunt and many more tied to the theme.All in all, Legoland Malaysia is definitely worth visiting! ",5.0

The hotel was great fun, each room kept the kids entertained. The elevator's are an enjoyable ride too although after a while 'turn the beat around' becomes a little annoying.  The staff were lovely, having a blonde haired child though helped... The main dining was ok, standard buffet breakfast. The park is just a day of lego activities and given it was empty we we're able to experience the entire park in a day.

The hotel itself is getting abit rundown. The upper bunk has ants and the pull out bed seems abit dusty.The breakfast buffet food was okay but not fantastic. And it is SUPER crowded on sunday mornings. The pros are it is really convenient if you are visiting legoland. And it is an exciting experience for kids as they play with the legos at the lobby and they can bring home the lego figuirines in the hotel chest.I noticed a few families with kids brought up the lego bricks from the lobby to their rooms.

Hence, the park was almost empty =DTwo major attractions were closed; the Technic roller-coaster and the huge water slide. Others were open for public =)Theme park & Water Park!Pros:Rides were awesome, no doubt about that! The choices were good as there were few for adults, few for children and most of them are actually for both adults and children. So overall, it's a Family theme park =) The special ones were definitely the abundance of 4D movies and rides. We got to experience the new ones (Ninjago, Batman, Lego Movie and Star Wars) and they were all great. Theme Park was clean and well-maintained. Staffs were helpful and cheerful along the way. We never had to queue to take pictures with the Lego people =D Toilets were amazing!!Restaurants are aplenty and their prices are affordable. YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO TO MEDINI MALL BECAUSE THEIR KFC AND BURGER KING PRICES ARE MORE EXPENSIVE THAN TYPICAL OUTLETS. KFC's Dinner Plate for RM19.90? Give me a break! Tried the foods at Asian Deli, delicious, combo of big nuggets and fries with 500-ml Ribena and nice, cold, big jelly for RM18. Saw another restaurant that offers combo of 3-pc chickens for RM20.Water park didn't disappoint too. A few of the big slides, however, can only be enjoyed wih minimum 2 / 3 people. So if you're a couple, you can't ride one or two of the big slides. The wet playgrounds (for small children and for the bigger children) were great, the lazy river was nice, the big pool was also good and the amenities were sufficient enough. Lockers are now either RM20 (small) or RM40 (big) all day long. Just put your important stuffs if you plan to bring your towel etc. But in my opinion, you don't need to bring a  lot of things to the pools.Changing rooms and toilets all have nice soap and shampoo.

1467,Annual Pass & Park Facilities ,"If you have plans to visit the theme park at least thrice (within 12months) then the annual pass will be worth your money. We drove from Singapore with two young children (9, 4) on three occasions. Traffic condition varies from a 45min smooth drive to 2.5hr jam.  As expected, school holidays are a nightmare on the causeway - regardless of route.The park isn't well landscaped. It's hot, hot, hot, with little shade. Whatever trees they had planted, you would think they are out to ensure you get a nice tan. No water coolers or hot water dispenser. You would think a theme park would be more family friendly than this. So bring water or prepare to purchase at the restaurants. We paid RM25 for a plastic tumbler which comes with a soft drink/ soda. You can reuse the tumbler and pay RM5 for subsequent drinks. Food is forgettable. If you must , the local menu will definitely be more satisfying than the offering on its western menu. I would much rather eat at KFC which is just at the park's entrance. But then again, you may be as lazy as we are to bother leaving the park just for a bite. The restaurants are the only rest stops to provide you with air conditioned respite from the unforgiving heat. So that's our excuse. Between the restaurants and gift shops, restaurants do lesser of a damage. The gift shops have plenty to offer. From loose bricks to figurine keychains, to box sets, and Lego apparels. Often, you will find swimmers or caps on sale (the locals are not likely to blow RM50 on a cap, but the exchange rate is too favorable for most other nationalities, esp the neighbouring Singaporeans). There's height limit for several rides so do not promise your child you will conquer the entire theme park. The driving school is fun for both bigger kids and toddlers. Be aware there's a kiosk just outside the driving schools trying to convince your child he needs a ""driver's license"" - which will set cost RM35 . We got one for our little one. There's a ride which you will get wet. It's at the end of the park. We skipped it since I was uncertain how my 4yo will take to it. Take the train. That's my way of sneaking in a break. Esp after your children made you 'put out fire' at the fire fighting school. I never work so hard in a theme park.  Everything else, is like anything else. Nothing to rave about. ",3.0
1468,"Not for thrill seekers, Really great for families with small children","For me it's quite expensive because there are not that many rides (and I went there on rainy season). Most of the attractions are for children and toddlers, or basically family, and definitely not for thrill seekers. If you really like Universal Studios Singapore, you probably will not like Legoland that much, but if you're looking for a child friendly and old people friendly place, this is the one for you.

1469,Everything is awesome!,"Our second time at Legoland Malaysia, and another enjoyable day. The rain put a slight dampener on things, but we still managed to have a good time.My son is 6, so this time he could go on all of the rides. There was a maximum of 2 minute wait for any of the rides, and for the most part, no wait, and often my son and his Aunty went round 4-5 times one after the other because there were so few people in the park.We would probably only go one more time, when my son is 7 as I think he would lose interest at around 8 years of age, as the park is geared towards the younger child.We purchased the obligatory piece of Lego, which is no cheaper than we can get at home, but he gets a thrill telling people he got it from Legoland.A very enjoyable day.",4.0

1472,"hot, expensive, yet satisfying","i went to both the theme park and water park. it was perfect for one day visit. moreover because it is not a peak season (a thursday in march) i went to the theme park first from 10 until 4pm then went to a very late lunch outside at medini mall (right in front of the park). after lunch i went to the water park for only an hour because it was closed exactly at 6 pm. it was enough for me because i brought small children who got tired easily.if you are going there with a happy energetic child who can walk a long way in hot days then i suggest you spend all day here to  fully enjoy the theme park. the water park in the other hand is quite small and can be enjoy the next day or not at all. bring a lot of cash to shop because to have a driving license printed you need rm 25 then for a package of 5 pictures in photobox you need rm 120. and they have like several gift shops all around the park and you might get tempted to buy those cute keychain or a set of .. lego, of course!",5.0
1473,Amazing when there's less than 100 people there! Great for Younger Kids!,"Usually amusement parks we have found to be filled with things that our 3 year isn't tall enough or old enough to partake in, but we loved Legoland. Most of the activities and rides he was able to do with us or alone. He definitely preferred the ones with us as he's in a stage where things are ""scary,"" but he had a great time. There were some questionable rides. Like the fire truck ride where it's all manual labor pumping and spraying and then running back. Then there's the tower chair thing that you pull yourself up manually? Trying to save electricity?! That's a bit strange.The food was decent, but there was only the pizza restaurant that has air conditioned seating. So we brought food from different carts and ate there because it started to rain. There were very few people there. The food was affordable overall in the park in comparison to other places.Bathrooms were really clean and fully stocked. There were a lot around the park.For splash mountain, they have  body dryers, but you have to pay.My dad tried 4 shops and none of them had adult t-shirts. They only had polos for adults, which is strange. Also the whole castle section was closed as well as some of the other larger kid rides, but we didn't mind.Also warning, there isn't a way to get to the hotel without getting soaked if it's raining. :)It's stroller friendly and a great park with even rental strollers. ",4.0
1474,Go on a weekday for a day of easy fun and excitement,"I've been apprehensive about going to Legoland as I'm not a kid anymore but I loved playing with Lego blocks when I was a kid. Some of my friends were interested and so, I said ""why not?"". And boy... did we have a great time!We went on a Thursday which is probably a wise decision as Monday to Thursday are not as busy as the weekends. The longest wait at any ride was about 15 minutes with most rides requiring a 5 to 10 minutes wait. There were also times when we didn't even have to wait and walked right in. Once we were given a 2nd go-around on a ride since no new riders came on - so much fun!If you brought a small bag or have loose stuff on you, don't worry as you can leave them in some temporary storage cubes next to the rides - just remember to pick up your stuff after each ride.For some of the water rides, be aware that you WILL get WET! On a hot day, it was a welcome relief from the heat and you do dry off walking around a little. Also, thankfully, most of the waiting areas were shaded as it's too hot to be in a queue outside in the sun.Although there weren't any truly scary rides, there were enough thrill rides for adults and kids alike to keep us happy. If you're a Star Wars fan, you'll really enjoy the Lego recreation of scenes from all the movies.My favorite ride was their new Ninjago ride which is a fun interactive ride where you and your friends are ninjas and try to score points hitting targets as your ride moves through different scenes. So much fun!The only downside are the overpriced food and souvenir prices. If they could lower these a little more, they might make it up in volume but unfortunately, like most theme parks, you're a captured audience and will have to pay what's offered. Granted the park entry fee was quite reasonable (especially with a 30% off coupon my friends had) for a whole day of fun - it would have been better to have more price ranges in their food and souvenirs.Still... overall, we had a great time and I would highly recommend this fun theme park - especially if you have kids. Or if you're a kid at heart!.",5.0

1476,Second visit in 12 months.,"On a trip to Singapore in May last year, I took my then 9 year old son to Legoland. We had booked the two parks but found we did not even finish the main park, never mind the water park in the 6 hours we had there. So I promised that we would come back and stay at the Legoland Hotel and have  longer at the parks. So we returned last week with 3 nights in the hotel and a 2 day pass. We did not really do any rides this time. Last time my son fainted on the first two, so we had continued with only the sedate/rides/activities. This time we concentrated on the 4d shows, imagination area with engineering cars and testing them, play areas, driving school etc. Even without rides we still spent several hours each day in the park and my son was in Lego heaven! although we had a pass for the water park also for various reasons we did not bother going there. It is rainy season at the moment, so low season. This meant the park was very quiet and there was no queuing for anything which was great and when it did rain we could just do an indoor activity. We were disappointed the first day to see the Ninjago ride was closed for maintenance as this was one that ad opened since our last visit and was safe for my son to go on. But by the afternoon of the 2nd day it had reopened and my son thought it was the best ride ever. It is a 4d Interactive ride!. ( for me not as good as Transformers ride in Singapore though) My son absolutely loves it in Legoland and at the Legoland hotel, so we will definitely be back, most likely next year again!",5.0

A lot of kids (of course!), thrilling rides for adults is kind of limited since the whole park is mainly meant for young kids, but I enjoyed it too. In my opinion, there is too many staff (life guards) at the water park (the flowing river thing). I felt like being monitored by them as they have nothing to do so just watching us while I was riding the ""river"". Adding more Chinese signage and more Chinese-speaking staffs would be better since there is so many Chinese tourists. Imagine i have to help a Chinese national lady to translate something to a staff on how to get to the entrance of the Legoland hotel from the water park. Overall it is a pleasant place and I would love to visit again.",5.0

1484,Suitable for family with kids,"This is really an awesome place for my family especially the kids since they are the big fans of lego. We bought 2 days combo passes since we've been told a day is not enough for your lego journey. Our stay in Legoland Hotel was wonderful. Everything was perfect. Our first day in the theme park was so exciting. There were lots of rides the kids tried. I recommended you the Project X and the Dino Island rides. Its quite challenging and scary at the same time. We truly loves the Dragon Apprentice. It brings so much joy to my kids. All the staff were friendly as well. The second day was for the wet park. We entered the wet park at 11 am and the weather is too hot and humid. Lucky me, I had my hat on! You will really need sun protection lotion or else you will get seriously tanned after few hours. This wet park is my favorite. We played all the rides over and over since we're coming on weekdays, so there was no need to compete with the others. I would like to mention a girl from the wet park shop name Syafika. She was so bright, cheerful, talkative and treat us very well. She told me about all the promotions they do have ,something not even a person in the theme park told me, so it was much more easier for us to shop. She assisted me from when I enter the shop till we left. My kids bought the minifigures and after I paid for it, she eventually told me that we can exchange minifigures with the staff, something that I myself never knew about. I'll definitely come to Legoland the other times.",4.0

1496,Legoland must see attractions and tips,"This is a review on Legoland in Malaysia. It is located at Iskandar Puteri, 7, Jalan Legoland, Medini, Nusajaya, Johor. Legoland is a place for everyone. Not only for Lego lovers and for people of all ages. It has all the things that a themepark should have such as roller coasters, a water park, galleries and lots of other types of attractions like a boating school. In Legoland there are many highlights. One highlight is the driving school. This is because  you could drive all over the course and the cars there had almost everything a real car has. It had a steering wheel, an engine and the stop and go breaks. I enjoyed this as a fun activity for everyone. The majority of things were great, one thing that I would improve at Legoland would be the Legoland Express. There is a very annoying voice playing over and over, and over again. To fix this, I would recommend to come two minutes early and not ten minutes. But I liked how I could see all the parts of Legoland from the Express.My top tip about Legoland would be. If you go on the Aqua zone wave racer or the Dino Island get a poncho or wear swimming clothes or else you will be soaking wet. We also thought we didn't need any of these, but now if we are going to any of these attractions again we will be prepared not to get totally soaking wet.               In conclusion, Legoland in Malaysia is a great place to go, because it's totally worth feeling a little of the action there. In my point of view Legoland is exceptional place for everyone.",4.0

1508,Not that Exciting!!!,"On a recent family holiday to Singapore my wife and I took our three kids to Legoland Malaysia for a day trip.  The kids were aged 14, 13 and 8 and to be honest the trip was aimed at the 8 year old as we had plans for the two older ones later on.The bus trip from Singapore took about 1hour 45mins passing through Singapore Customs and Immigration, over the causeway and then through Malaysia Customs and immigration.  We went on a Wednesday as we had read previous trip advisor reviews and picked when it was not school holidays. On arrival our 14 year old summed up the place with one statement and that was, ""I feel like I am in the middle of the zombie apocalypse"".  it was dead, there was no-one.  From the carpark to the front gates we were it.  I was quietly thinking to my self ""this is awesome""  but was sadly mistaken.  The park is truly designed and caters for small children about the 8 yrs of age.  Our youngest had fun but expected more.  The park is quite large but with not very much in it and nothing was really appealing.  One of the bonuses was that we never waited for a ride and were welcomed with open arms to give the staff something to do.  Overall I would say that there would have been about 100 people in the park.  This being said if it was a very busy day we would have been very angry for the cost and what was available.  This is certainly no Disneyland if you have that sort of expectation and it certainly is not any other theme park that comes to mind.  If I knew what I know now I would not have gone to the trouble that we did to get there and I would have found other things for our 8 year old to do.",3.0

The rides are like the rides in the other theme parks but what I liked about Legoland is they have ample of places to sit which has shade, fan and mist so you wont feel really hot. There are also tables with Lego bricks in some  rides where you can play while waiting for you companion.  They have this air conditioned place where you and your kids can build cars (or anything with wheels) and they can have a race with the other kids.  It's a good place to stay when the sun is scorching hot. The kids wont get bored there anyway. I was expecting the dads will help their kids make cars but they were building their own and let the kids make theirs :) :) :)They also have playground where kids can just play if you are tired of the rides.  I think there are 3 in different locations but the one that I liked best is the one with roof, I think its near the observation tower but bigger kids will not like it.

Always a breeze. No long queues. Rides are a good length and if it's not enough - so easy to jump in again! Reasonable food and drinks choices. great balance of rides and building activities. The Get Together to PLAY promotion is perfect to get family and friends to bond. The speed building challenge to make a LEGO Rooster was great fun for the family.Ninjago LIVE at the City Stage is awesome - always. Believe me, don't miss it. Japanese puppetry at its finest. Shows at 11AM, 1PM, 3PM and 5PM.The newest Ninjago ride in the Land of Adventure is a great addition to the Legoland Malaysia's attractions. As a family practicing Choi Kwang Do, it was great to work on our punches while going through the attraction :0). It was not scary for a 3-year old yet a fun challenge for grown-ups too.We always enjoy going through the different rides and the opportunity to skip some and save them for another visit because we are premium annual pass holders.Well done LEGOLAND! TIP: consider taking the Premium Annual Pass if you KNOW you want to come back again and again! So worth it. The passes which we just renewed offers 20% discount in the hotel, 10% discount for non-promotional merchandise.But don't pat yourself on the back too hard just yet.***WARNING for the Premium Annual Pass***TO LEGOLAND MALAYSIA Management,While your establishment rewards loyal returning guests with a memorable visit, your park staff have been inconsistent with applying the discount. The Benefits of Premium Annual Pass (PAP) clearly indicated 10% off for the photo imaging products (and no exceptions in the fine print mentioned on Terms and Conditions). Legoland Malaysia does not deliver as promise on this one. I opted to take family souvenir photos at the Dragon's Apprentice ride knowing that we can avail of the PAP discount. Photo kiosk staff said it was not permitted. I did not argue and reserved my complaint for Guest Services at the park entrance.Guest Services investigated my query after I showed the Guest Services officer that in their laminated Benefits of PAP list - I should receive the discount. After being referred to two other Guest Services staff, Mus - who look after our concern first said - we dont qualify for the discount because 1) discount only applies to photographers taking snaps at park entrance (NOTE: There was no mention that in the benefits list)That was of course not acceptable. So Mus went out again to consult with someone else. He came back with reason no. 2!2) discount only applies to the photos purchased from the BRICKS shop photo counterStill, that is not justified by whatever documentation we have read fir the PAP benefits. Nothing of this sort is mentioned. So, Mus left again to consult for another time!When he came back, he had a new reason for us! Reason no. 3 was:3) Our photos were Buy 1 Take 1 promotional deal. Not wanting blow a fuse and ruin what is genuinely a good holiday, my husband pointed out that it is really dodgy that we have been given 3 different excuses in a matter of 10 minutes! We have accepted that obviously we cannot win as Mus will not honour our PAP benefit.Please be mindful of what Legoland Malaysia has committed to give their returning guests. Play well.

1517,Much better than expected.,"Getting to Johor Bahru is a bit of a pain from Singapore and if you‚Äôre travelling at peak hour you will get stuck at the border for over an hour. Our Uber driver that picked us up from the airport said he did not have a passport, but I think he just did not want to sit at the border. So we needed to switch to a another vehicle to complete the trip.We booked a Lego-land Hotel and theme park package and were very impressed. On arrival the hotel entry and reception is spectacular with huge Lego themed play areas. The themed rooms are also equally spectacular with lots of fun things to do including safe cracking with a Lego surprise. Our room overlooked both the theme and water park. The breakfast buffet was equal to any 5 star hotel we have stayed at and the service was friendly and efficient. The hotel also has a nice supervised roof top pool with shade sails.We planned to spend 2 days at Legoland but probably needed 3. The theme park is awesome for young kids and our teenager even had a ball. The park is huge with lots of Lego models everywhere as well as many great rides and rollercoasters all designed for younger (Not Thrill Seeking) riders. The adjoining water park was also very good with lots of great slides, wave pool, drifting river etc.The meals and drinks in the park were reasonably priced but if you need more choice there is a shopping mall just outside the entry with lots of local restaurants and take away. There are also ATMs in the park and the mall.",5.0

No wonder I thought it was a little bit too quiet for a theme park when I first arrived,The only ride that was fun for all of us was NinjaGo. ",3.0
1522,Kids paradise,"The theme parks were great fun and you honestly need a day for each. The water park had pools (including a wading pool for kids with slides) , bigger slides for bigger kids and different water based attractions. The lego park (dry park) was amazing. Great cities and monuments of the world all built from Lego. we had aeroplane rides, kids drove little cars, race fire engines while putting out fires , we rode through an Egyptian themed city shooting at dots for points, kids could program robots at the science centre, we paddled in boats, rode on trains and zoomed around the water in a speedboat and shot softballs in the air. There is also a massive kids playground and places to eat and shops and things made for lego of course (including animals, plants and structures). B mindful of weather, so get into theme parks early cuz u can get anythin from a shower 2 a torrential downpour in JB :) All in all, A kids play and learning paradise (so plan using the map of the parks your given)",5.0
1523,Good fun!,"I had visited legoland in the year it opened in 2012 and now after 5 yrs. In general, I feel it needs to improve its maintainence of the miniland. The miniland legos have become really old and weathered. Visitors need be a more sentient towards cleanliness. The cafe near the miniland served nuggets and chips exactly half an hour after we ordered and the food options are really poor and expensive. Else it is still a good experience.",4.0
1524,Enjoy Vacation,"The park is the best place for a group or a family to visit during holiday. A lot of games can join it. Especially for the kids, they can play a car racing, ride the fire-truck and a lot of things can done here. Only the spoil moment is when you need to wait about 5 - 20 min just to play one game.  We sure, the theme park can fix all the services to be more efficient and quick. So everyone can play with enjoy and fun.",4.0
1525,Not good for little kids,"The ride and everything was OK, but my 4 year could go on most of the rides as it required height and age to be able to go on rides. He was the right height, but not the age. They take you money but don't allow you to go on the rides.",1.0

1527,Cute Park but needs better training for staff,"The park is really nice but if the staff was better trained to handle crowds, we could have had a great time.   For example, there is a little boat ride near the front gates.  There were only 5 boats running and we had to wait almost an hour to have a turn.  There were about 8 boats that weren't being used.  A manager came by and then they started putting additional boats in but this was after the line grew for 40 mins. The car race near the front, there are 4 cars running.  There is no urgency in getting the cars filled with children.   Once my son stopped, we then had to wait until 2 other children finished the track which was another 4 minutes.     Another odd thing is watching these huge groups of adults with no children going on children's ride.  There should be a kid express line or you should have to have a child in order to go on the ride.  (I am taking about the little kid rides)  There were many little examples of this through out the day and the constant waiting really put a damper on the day.  It was not a crowded day but we had to wait because staff didn't put the guests first and showed no enthusiasm for what they do.",3.0
1528,Best place to visit,We took the bus (WTS bus) from Singapore to Malaysia...It was very convenient and fast...You just need to get off at the border to stamp your passport thank your way....It took us 1hr only to reach Malaysia....Best time to visit is during cool season...we actually spent 2 days here from  31stDec - 1st of Jan 2017....The air was cool not too hot and we went early in the morning and not too many  people during that time and we got to enjoy all the rides. First day we just stayed at Legoland and 2nd day we finish off Legoland than after lunch we went to water park which was awesome...It was raining that day so we really enjoyed the cool water.....This was a big hit for my son as he enjoyed all the rides in the water park....And did not want to go home in the evening..He keep on saying one more rides please....Take your kids to Legoland and enjoy it...Even adults enjoy some of the rides....,5.0
1529,Could have been better treating young children,"Legoland will always be popular among the kids and there is no exception for my children. Last Saturday's experience was a mix of both, good and bad, in terms of the Legoland staff. We were greeted at the entrance by a young man full of sense pf humour, Tina (I know it is a girl's name and so naturally I would be curious and asked him whether he got his name tag wrong but he gracefully answered my question with a smile. However, our experience wasn't pleasant at the NinjaGo station when my children were 'banished' to the end of the queue by another staff, Angah, when she didn't see that I just joined the line and about to join my girls. I felt that that was totally unnecessary as I was a little slow catching up with my girls as I was accompanying my pregnant wife.A lot more can be done for their staff training in handling with crowd and people. Even though the Legoland staff are part-timers and mostly still schooling or having their vacation; wanting to earn quick bucks, still basic courtesy need to be observed. I reprimanded the lady staff and that is not acceptable when I saw another parent was given the leeway to join his family in the queue. ",3.0
1530,Awesome place for our kids!!,My kids 9 and 6 loved legoland. We bought the 2 day combo ticket and spent the first day at the theme park and second day at the water park and then the theme park again.The highlight is the Ninjago Adventure. We visited when there was no crowd and there was no waiting time for any of the rides. Food is available in the theme park and we are not allowed to bring food from outside.  The prices are a little high. We tried the Pizza Mania and the pizzas were good. Overall a good place for a vacation for the kids. ,5.0
1531,Better than expected,"We went to Legoland for a day trip from Singapore by booking a bus through WTS travel online. Crossing the border was an interesting experience. Takes a good 2-2.5 hours so factor that in when thinking about booking the return trip. We had more than enough time at Legoland from the 9am bus there to the return at 5pm however this was without any children. There were no lines for the rides so we breezed through the place however this is probably due to us being lucky and picking a good day to go as it was the day before NYE. The theme park was beautifully decorated for Christmas.The miniature models of Asia's wonders were the highlight for us. There are some nice rides as well. The observation ride was quite nice and gives you a lot of good photo ops. Unfortunately a big mountain one that seemed like the most exciting one was closed for maintenance. We were in line for the Ninjago ride and they suddenly experienced technical difficulties so we had to leave. This did not bother us too much as we were just going to see what it was about but children around us were disappointed. There is a really detailed Star Wars Lego exhibit area.Food was average. The Lego fries were cool but I did not enjoy the burger. The weather was hot and humid and walking around did feel quite awful however they did have some nice misting stations and some shade spots. The mall across the road is not something I would call a mall. It barely had any shops, although there is a BK and KFC if you want to eat before or after the theme park. It looked like it might still be under construction so it may improve. Did not visit the water park.",4.0

1534,A good place for family with small children but subjected to weather condition,Having been to various theme parks and I found Legoland Malaysia a good and relatively reasonably priced for entrance fees. We have visited a few times anThe only downside is the tropical weather here in Malaysia. Weather can be unpredictable such as unexpected horrendous rainpour. Bring along your umbrellas and sunscreen always!,4.0

1536,Fun Rides and Acitivities at Legoland Malaysia,"It is a fun theme park especially for those who love Lego.We stayed at Legoland Hotel (really recommended) and the theme park is only a couple of walks away.I advise you to take the combo package (hotel + theme park) as both places give so much fun to the kids.There are lots of rides inside the theme park. Some rides can make you wet. Bring a raincoat.The park is an open space, so it will be very hot during the day. So I advice to put on some sunscreen and/or bring Umbrella",5.0
1537,Fun for kids!,"After much thoughts and reviews made a visit here recently...a short escapade for kids from Singapore especially if they are a Lego fanatic! we made a visit only to the theme park and not the water theme park. The rides were nice. The best part was the Miniature city. Excellent work! Hats off to all who took so much effort to do it! Totally enjoyed it. Although there are shelters with fans everywhere couldn't enjoy it in the hot sun! would be nice if the whole area was a sheltered one. This way both the hard work and their efforts will be appreciated and enjoyed. we also enjoyed the star wars Lego rooms which was aircon and fun to watch too! kids will definitely enjoy it. The food in the restaurants were nice. The rest rooms were very clean and well maintained too. I am not sure about the water theme park though! The car drive for kids were fun too.Tips: Try to visit the miniature land when the sun is down. Don't forget to take umbrella, hand fans, wet tissue and water all along with you!",4.0
1538,A fun place to go when you have the place to yourself,"We were super lucky and went when it was quiet so we didn't have to queue for any rides, we pretty much walked up and onto each ride.We went for two days (did a half day at the water park) and there was plenty to keep the kids busy.Compared to Disneyland the rides were a bit tame but it was nice for the kids to have a go on everything.The staff were fantastic, you really can't fault the place.",5.0
1539,A wonderful and fun experience at Legoland Malaysia,"On Dec 26, 2016 me and my family visited Legoland Malaysia Resort in Johor Bahru. I got a couple of feedbacks from my friends both good and not so but I wanna experience it firsthand. So my family went to Singapore for a Christmas holidays. We decided to rent a Van going to Legoland from an online travel site back and forth to Singapore where they were staying. It was very convenient choice of transportation especially if you're a big family with 3 kids - you don't need to fall in line to the Immigration. There are other modes of transportation to Legoland like buses and taxi but for me this is the best decision we ever made. We left Singapore at 10 AM and arrived in Legoland past 11 AM. The gloomy weather is perfect no rains and not too hot. The park has many ammenities and themes (City, Adventure, NinjaGo, Miniland, Technic and Kingdoms) - each with its own attractions and offerings. The City is for kids - it has 2 shows, restaurants, and a couple of kid rides. The Adventure, NinjaGo, Miniland, Technic and Kingdoms are for all ages. The Adventure's best offering is the Dino Land where the log jam drop ride is for adrenaline hunters. The NinjaGo has the newest ride - the 4D NinjaGo the ride which features the latest 4D technology. The Miniland displays the fantastic sculptures of different countries landmarks using Lego bricks - perfect for photo shoots. The Technic's best offering are the Star Wars Miniland and the adrenaline coaster ride Project X which has a steep drop. The Kingdoms are is my favorite - it has 2 roller coasters Dragon Apprentice for kids and The Dragon for all ages provided the kids meet the height requirement. There is also a workshop for kids who would like to bake and the area is also perfect for picture taking with its medieval castle and outlets/cafes. We ended up riding 80% of all the rides including the Observation Tower which will give you a 360 degrees view of Legoland Theme Park. We wrapped up around 730 PM in time with our van pickup satisfied, happy and delighted we were here. Looking forward to come back.",5.0
1540,Value for money. Best theme park in the whole of malaysia,"This is my second visit to legoland. Love the place. You only pay once and you get to try out all the rides without being squeeze for more money later. There are so many rides for all age group. Each ride was created with so much care and attention to detail. They are not your run of the mill boring merry go round rides, but they put in alot of effort with the theme and to make the ride as interesting as possible. There is a new ninja lego ride which i def recommend all who go to try it out. Simply superb!",5.0

1543,Fun day trip from Singapore,"As a group of 6 young adults keen on theme park adventures, we decided to take a day trip to Legoland and Legoland water park. The journey took about 1.5 hours each way by taxi which we had pre-booked through an online website. The drive was pleasant and the immigration checkpoints were simple to cross as we did not have to get out of the car. Would highly recommend pre-organising a taxi- the higher price is well worth the convenience!Altogether we spent about 7 hours at Legoland and the water park. The parks weren't crowded in Jan which meant we could do the rides multiple times with short lines! The water park was more adult friendly with several awesome slides and build your own lego rafts/boats. Legoland itself was a bit disappointing owing mostly to the thunderstorm that caused many major rides to close. Several rides at both parks were also closed for maintenance. We knew beforehand that the park would be designed mainly for kids and weren't surprised when we were refused entry to some of the rides for the little ones! Overall, we found the staff to be very friendly and the parks well managed, albeit a little empty.Would highly recommend exchanging money before heading to Legoland- cash is needed for lockers and few shops outside legoland accept credit card. Even the Burger King in the mall outside Legoland was cash only. There are ATMs available and shops at Legoland will exchange money for you if you buy something, but the exchange rate is not that great.",4.0

You can visit Legoland Malaysia website for more info.We came around as early as 10am to avoid crowds. We were quite lucky as the weather was bright & shiny. We managed to enter all attractions except few that my son was not allowed to enter due to height & age (my son is 4 years old).The driving licence class, boat riding, airplane ride, the fire fighting competition. All those activities were really fun & my son enjoyed so much. Most of the attractions here are for kids actually but adults sure can have fun too. The new Ninjago attractions was amazing. We had twice rides as less people came in the morning. There was also a Ninjago Live Show which had several shows throughout the day. It was also one of the best show as my son really liked it.Overall Legoland trip was amazing. We enjoyed our time together & I believe all parents with young children will definitely enjoy spending time here.",5.0
1547,Wonderful Fun At Legoland M'sia,"This is my 2nd visit at Legoland M'sia within year 2016. I have 3 kids and all my kids want to go again. I bought 2 day combo park tickets.

Later in the afternoon, my family will play and take all rides at water park until closing time. Then dinner. Repeat the same fun on 2nd day. My family enjoy the new Ninjago ride, shooting inside Land of Adventure, Boat School at Lego City, Driving School at Lego City, Observation Tower, Star Wars Exhibition, Water Park, Royal Joust horse ride at Lego Kindom and many more. My kids are never tired and never have enough time to play even when it is closing time. We will definitely come again.",5.0
1548,Lego lovers Paradise,The park is not that big. We were able to go around it in just half a day. It fall short compared to HK Disneyland. You need to be a Lego enthusiast to really appreciate the park. It also doesn't have much activities or rides that older kids will enjoy. You won't need 2 day tickets for this place. You can enjoy going around the park for half a day then enjoy the water park in the afternoon.,4.0
1549,VALUE FOR MONEY,Worth visit. New concept of theme park base on lego block. My kids really enjoy the visit. Maybe next visit will be water park. To attact more local visitor ie malaysiaan maybe can consider give more lower rate and promotions package.,4.0
1550,"Great hype, not so good reality?","My nephew, a young Lego fan, enjoyed the park (and hotel). But even at a young age (he was 7 years old when we visited), he was able to make comparisons with other theme parks... As a adult, naturally I expected more. But I think, any family member accompanying their young ones would also expect grander attractions and more well-maintained facilities for the price of admission... I think the saving grace of Lego Land for us were the Western snacks at The Cafe inside the park.",3.0
1551,Fabulous theme park for young children,"We went to Legoland resort today with a two night stay after flying in to Singapore. My 6yo and 9yo have been so unbelievably excited and left feeling amazing. The rides were perfect for their ages and they were thrilled. There was only a couple of rides that were a little bit 'older' so this was the first theme park they had been on the majority of rides. That being said, if you didn't have young children it would be weird to come here.It was very very hot but there was heaps of fans, misters and aircon everywhere.... Better facilities than HK Disneyland weather wise!  Food was decently priced for a theme park but not much range... On a Tue once school had gone back it was really empty! We didn't stand in line at all and the kids could go in rides over and over. Lego wise... The star wars mini figure display was a big hit and the little characters around the park that added atmosphere.Overall we had a great trip and might bring the kids back in a few years before they are too old.

1554,Epic trip from Singapore ,"We had an 8 yr old that has been looking forward to legoland for our month long holiday around Asia . We took public transport from Singapore to get there which was good . The problem was that we had spent the day at universal studios in Singapore the day before . Legoland in comparison seemed to be the little brother trying really hard but not quite getting there . We went with three kids and if the water park wasn't there, they would of been a bit bored . There were several rides offline in both the water park and legoland and then the ninjargo ride broke down , very disappointing . It was clean , pristine , very lego and deserted. Was it worth the $350 entry fee and the 14 hours round trip to Singapore , probably not was the response from my 8 year ago legoholic. ",3.0
1555,A great place for small kids and adults!!,"We went with our 10 and 8 year old daughters. since the schools had reopened after X'Mas and New year break, most of the rides and activities were free. Hence our kids could do many rides/activities multiple times. They really freaked out and since we had to be with them, we also became kids. Overall we had good fun. At Ninjago, we scored the maximum points as a family and my little baby was among the top 5. We had taken a combo ticket, but since we spent a lot of time at the theme park, we could not utilise our ticket for water park. The lego blocks section was big hit, as we made earthquake resistant high rise as a family. Few pointers:We stayed at Somerset Medini, right next to Legoland. It was not a good choice for various reasons. First, we had bad experience with our stay [service, cleanliness, food etc.]. Next time, we will stay in Johor and come to spend time at Legoland. Getting a taxi in the night at Nusajaya [Legoland area] is very difficult. There are no good restaurants nearby. Security is another major concern here. When we went to India Kitchen [an Indian restaurant near to Somerset], one of the staff there was advising us not to walk back to Somerset [it was just walkable distance] as it is not safe. Getting a cab is extremely difficult for the short distance. The blue cab [ premier cab] guys fleece customers. They are real crooks. When you try to book a cab through Somerset, the fare you pay in very high as there is some understanding between the cab guys and the staff at Somerset. In the night after teh park is closed everything comes to a halt at Nusa Jaya. Hence, I recommend anyone planning to go to Legoland to stay at Johor than staying at Nusa Jaya. Next time we will go from Singapore to Legoland and not from Kualalumpur.",5.0

Also please add more baby- and toddler-relevant activities/rides as 2 of the only rides are out-of-order when we were there, earlier this month.

1560,Very hot but fun,"My 4 year old thoroughly enjoyed himself at legoland. Though there were rides which he cannot take due to height limit, all the other rides made him so happy. The weather is a killer though. Also used the baby room at Legoland but strangely it only opens at 12.30pm to 4pm. It's very clean and well equipped. However, men are not allowed in the place so my hubby had to take my baby with him outside while I get to enjoy the aircon and facilities in the nursing room. There was no one else there except me, maybe because I was there at the time it opened. Would be nice if my hubby could come in to with my baby as there were toys meant for babies in that place. And they can wait for me comfortably while i express milk.",3.0

1563,Heaven for kids who love lego!,"Legoland is well set up, and interesting for a large age range. Attractions are very diverse and very creative. Kids are challenged to play and parents are also building blocks everywhere! I would say there are 2 points that could be better, 1. Food....but to be fair I haven't seen any kids entertainment park do that well! And the lego hotel has good dining options. 2. Shade! It's hot hot hot and for the small ones it's little difficult to maintain a whole day outside, there should be more shade and options to cool off. In the waterpark there is almost no shade except for baby pools. But overall one of the best parks I visited with my kids! ",4.0
1564,Legoland driving licence,Great day out. Missed out on the water park. I would recommend 2 day visit. Visit water park and theme park on different days to enjoy the full experience.The theme park was fantastic for my son who is 5 years old. Getting his legoland driving license was cool.Luckily we visited on a quiet day and had very little to no waiting time at the rides.The park has a few places to eat.we chose the italian themed restaurant. The service waz fast and the food was good although a little expensive.Although I am a non smokers we had a smoker in our party. There is limited smoking areas around the park. We found one after staff directed us. Such a big area should have more designated smoking areas.I will definitely visit again and combine the water park and theme park.,5.0
1565,Excellent for family with 5-8 y.o kids,"We went to Legoland on 4th January from Singapore via car rent that we book from the Legoland hotel (we emailed the hotel directly after hotel booking was done). The fair was RM 470 for a family of 7, since we had 5 adults (including my 13 y.o daughter), an 8 y.o and 2 toddlers, we can squeeze in up to 8 and it is very spacey. We had 2 big suitcases, 2 medium suitcase, 2 strollers and personal backpacksThe immigration out of Spore was fine. But when we entered Malaysia, we had to step off the vehicle and cued in the office because the finger scanner had issue in the scanner, the 4 said. Turned out this stepping out of the vehicle is a regular thing and entering the country would take up to one full day. But we were lucky as the immigration was not full, we only queued after 1 familySince we stayed in the Legohotel we had special price, where you buy 2 day combo ticket of water and theme park for a price of 1 day combo ticket. Be assured to buy this special ticket upon your check in at the hotel, as the reception is not too informative (a good thing I asked this in my email together when I booked our transport)Water Park:I've experienced better waterpark in Bali. Where rides for small kids, not so small kids and adults are well accommodated. In this park, it is quite bland for our family likingThe unique thing it has a small race arena for Lego toy boat where kids can create their own Lego toy boats and race them off with other boats (a similar attraction is available in the theme park in the Build and Test attraction but you race cars, instead)To rent locker, please be informed that there is 2 sizes, i.e. big and small ones. Small ones is RM 20, big is RM 40. The rent is for whole day. To rent big ones, go to the renting machine in the inner part of the locker room, because the ones that is near the entrance only accommodates small ones. I had to spend extra RM 20 because I did not know this - where I ended up renting 1 small and 1 big lockerIf you're thinking in renting Cabana (AC-ed room) near the pools, you can skip renting the lockers, as the RM 240 includes a small safe deposit box, a medium size locker with lock, free minibar, 2 Legoland towels, 2 Legoland tumbler, 2 key chainsBring your own towels, as they charge certain amount for renting towels (did not ask how much - as I was informed by my sister who browsed about this)The bathroom is very clean.Theme Park:When you enter, don't forget to ask for stamp sheet where you can collect the stamps of the rides you've gone on to participate in the lucky draw and make extra fun for the kids to collectMost of the rides bonds the whole family together, has physicall activities that makes your body moving, and very child friendly - you'd feel like you're playing in a gigantic private daycareYou have small roller coasters and other thrilling rides for those who are just trying and not meeting the required height yet. They have driving courses for toddlers and for bigger kids. Where it all just thought of nicelyIf you want to purchase photos after rides, the package is RM 60 for 2 photos (1 big and 1 small) but the same photos. If you can go on the ride twice, you can request to print those 2 different moments so you don't have duplicate photos. The price includes soft copiesWe visited the park from 10.00 - 17.30 and we experienced most of the rides we were interested in and had 2nd rounds for our favorite ones. Keeping in mind that we came on a working day and Malaysian school vacay in over, the queue was very shortIn the map, they inform different resto in the park and what type food is sold in those different resto, as the food is not the same in one shop than another. We ate at King's Grill. The family package was very good and good tastingAt the Big Shop, you can engrave personalized name on your lego brick key chain or box container for an extra RM 10. This service is not available in other shopsIf you have a photo bracelett and you want to purchase all or some of it (if the Legoland guys takes your picture, they will give it to you to look at your photos and you can buy on which ones you like), do not forget to check it before going home. As if you forgot and only got back the following day, those picture will not be available anymore, because they delete it dailyAll in all, it ideal to take your kids if they are 7-8 y.o, because they can go on every ride as their height is already meeting the minimum requirement and it is quite fun and thrilling for themIf you have 4-5 y.o, they can also have a great time with good variation of ridesFor those below 3 y.o, the park is free of charge (for water park you still need to pay RM 11). If your kid is still the only child, better wait 1-2 years at least. But if you have older kids on top of the below 3 y.o, go ahead and create great memories :)Note: To have full experience, stay at the Legohotel. It makes an exponential better experience (a seperate review is available dor the hotel)",4.0
1566,Full day ,My family of six with children aged from 15-9 enjoyed Legoland and waterpark a lot. A great selection of rides and fun and took a fun day to get through things.Be warned there is no money changer or WIFI so come prepared! We took the bus from Singapore for about $60 and a taxi for 6 back fro $150. I thought I'd be able to book a bus but not he case! Must be prepared but was worth it Fun day. ,4.0
1567,For kids and adults,"The city is built on Legoland. Great plac for both kids and adults. Certainly not Unversal Studios that has more attractions. A little pricy for locals. Liked the Star Wars exhibits. Water park is exciting as well. I understand that both facilities cannot be completed on the same day but we managed to, as it was not a weekend or public holiday. Great place!",4.0
1568,A day out with the kids,"The entry price is ok considering it is an international franchise. However, the build quality is shoddy. The layout of the park is decent, they've recently added huge fans to solve the heat and humidity problem. Well, not solve but make it a bit bearable. Rides are good but on our visit, two rides were closed for maintanance. Ninja Go (supposed to be new!) and Dino ride. The staff are friendly and during low season there is no que for the rides. The price of food at legoland is expensive, just like any other theme park. The taste? Mediocre the most. The water park is ok but I still prefer Adventure Cove in Sentosa, Singapore. Overall a good theme park to bring the family for a day out but just be prepared to spend money to feed them. ",4.0
1569,Full day fun activities,"It was our first time to visit Legoland. It was an all day event. Although it opened at 10 am, lots of people already at the counter area around 9am+.

Hotel residence will be given a 30 minutes privilege to enter the park earlier than normal public ",5.0
1571,Superb for family with young children!,"We travelled from singapore. We arrived at Tuas Link immigration by 10am. And we got our stamp in 2.5 hours! OMG, beware no proper toilet for kids and no nursing room for babies. We arrived legoland by 2pm. We purchased the combo tickets online and the officer told us to go to waterpark first. The changing room is clean and dry. The locker is spacious for 2 backpack and 4 pair of shoes. The waterpark is just so-so. Our 5y daugther spent her time building a raft and try to float it. The 2y son enjoy riding the mini slides. The waterpark guides are everywhere to ensure the kids play it safe. Great job! Spent 2 hrs in the waterpark then we head to the theme park. Most of the ride suites our 5y daugther but not the baby. He got bored easily. However he enjoy the musical fountain and the playground next to the 3D cinema. Buy lego here, it is cheaper than kidzstation or toy'r us. Stay overnight here instead going for a day trip from singapore! It helps to reduce the younger kids tired from the journey.",5.0

1574,BRILLIANT,"This is the 4th Legoland we have been to (we have been to Windsor, California and Billund previously). The hotel is great, the staff are exceptionally friendly, Legoland itself is awesome, with great flow around the park and the water park, well it was fab. Our kids had an absoloute ball, the life guards (at the water park and the hotel pool) were just fantastic, getting to know the kids and making sure everyone had the best day. If you are anywhere close, don't miss this great place. Stay in the hotel if you can, the lifts (elevators) are so cool and you get to go into the park before the general public. The room decor is just amazing and the play area is a hit with the kids. I have never been to a theme park where the staff are so genuinely friendly and give out such a positive vibe (and I have been to many theme parks!). Thumbs up to Legoland Malaysia and especially to Eddy, a lifeguard at the waterpark who topped off a great visit. ",5.0
1575,Go to universal studio instead ,"Takes 1 1/2 to 2 hours each way to get there from Singapore. Inside Legoland there isn't a lot of shade,fans, etc.  It was a hot day. Only a few big rides, we waited 90min for project x, which scared the 14 year old. If you want to go to theme park for rides, got to universal studio instead ",3.0
1576,Great Legoland with lots of building lego.,This was our third Legoland.  We had previously visited the two in the US.   We found this to have few crowds and the lines were very short.   Lots of building lego throughout the park for kids to use and the staff were very friendly.  A great day!,4.0
1577,Superb..!!,Visited both theme park and water park. Amazing. To many activities to do in one day both for adults and children. Nice and attractive place.,5.0
1578,Just fine...,"I was hesitant to go here after reading the average reviews but since it would be hard to bring again my entire family (9 adults and 2 kids) to SG and MY, I decided to push through. The rides are simple and not quite impressive as  you would expect, thus uncomparable to disneyland and universal. The good thing here is that they are no queues in most attractions given that there are no much people. You can go around the theme park and all the rides in few hours.We also did not enjoy our visit due to high humidity and the heavy rain in the afternoon. I would suggest to bring extra shirts. Dec/Jan also is not a perfect weather for Malaysia as it is normally rainy especially in the afternoon.",3.0
1579,Excellent!,"My two teenage sons love coming here to LegoLand Malaysia. We came from Singapore, we take an hour and a half drive. There are many activit√©s to do there. It is not only just for kids, I even like to go on a few rides myself. My kids love going on the roller coaster ""Project X"". I would definitely Reccomend that, I always love going on it with them! There is also a great water park with fun but dangerous rides, it is defnitley not as good as the theme park rides.",5.0
1580,Great Day out,"We spend a day here coming from Singapore. The longest time we had to wait was in customs leaving and returning to Singapore. But having no lines at the rides made up for that. This place is super clean, efficient and just lovely. We all had a great time here.",5.0
1581,One visit is enough,Visited Lego land upon my daughter's request.The place is just like an ordinary theme park with rides except for the lego star wars attraction and lego centers which my daughter enjoyed the most. Don't miss Lego Mini land where they made various landmarks of certain countries in Asia out of lego.,3.0
1582,Great for young and old,"My teenage son and I recently spent 1 day here. We came from Singapore for the day with WTS Travel. There are many shops to buy Lego and lots of rides for the kids. It was a very hot day and there were plenty of places with shade thankfully. There is an area of miniature towns and attractions made out of Lego and this was very impressive. The attention to detail was amazing. There was even an airport entirely constructed from Lego. Just brilliant. There are 3 or 4 restaurants which are air-conditioned and offer a variety of food. If you buy large Lego items there are different sized lockers near the entrance to store your purchases. They are cash only but there is an ATM next door if you need it. I recommend Lego Land for young families and those who are young at heart. We didn't go on the rides, or use the water park and our 5 hours there was too long, but I'm sure little kids won't ever want to go home. It is a great place to visit.",4.0
1583,Day off!,"Amazing! Perhaps because my expectations were low as I heard from my friends that the games were catered towards more for the kids. However to my surprise, the games were super interactive!! As a lego fan since young, this place is perfect for me! Will be back soon!",5.0
1584,Great fun,Great fun for kids well organized and very clean !

1586,LegoLand is Perfect for Kids !,"We spent 2 days in LegoLand .. The new attraction (Ninjago) was very good .. in fact, we queue up 3 times to play the new interactive games. Star Wars setup was also very good ... my son wants to but the Lego AT AT (4 legs) but they do not sell old stocks anymore. Overall, a good visit ",5.0
1587,Fun but was very hot,Fun and the new Ninjago rides was specially fun as it caters for whole family to have fun together. We were lucky that the queue was not very long so we did not suffer long waiting hours under the sun.Can consider visiting again with more friends or family members.,4.0
1588,Excellent place to visit,"If you have no plans of visiting Singapore and Universal, this would be a great alternative. The rides are not so scary and infact quite fun. They are good for both kids and adults. People with a penchant for roller coasters such as the Gallactica in Universal SG might find it boring and kiddish. But we definitely loved the place. But try to avoid weekends and holidays which might lead to your spending most of your time in queues. We had taken discount vouchers from the MATTA fair which made the experience even better. ",5.0
1589,Average,"Been here a few times. I believe this place needs a make over. And also because it is hot and humid, they should build shades. They've progressed but i think they need to work on retaining the beauty of the place. The rides and shows are awesome though. If you don't have the kid in you, then you might not enjoy it. ",3.0
1590,Just Brilliant!,"We went to Legoland for our son's 5th birthday. We stayed at the hotel and on arrival were instantly amazed at the attention to detail. A giant lego castle and more lego than you can imagine to play with! We had a pirate themed room and I would have been happy to hang out there most of the stay. Kiddie sized bathroom amenities made them feel extra special. The themepark is so well put together and planned out. The amenities are kept really clean and it is very well maintained. Everyone is super friendly and we did not have to wait long to go on rides as it is very efficiently run. The waterpark was our favourite. There are activities for all ages, it is designed like lego - duplo for the little ones, mega blocks for the toddlers and lego for the older kids. My advice is to take zip lock bags and containers and pack lunch and snacks from the amazing hotel buffet in the morning. Head to the water park first - it is less crowded then. Have a bit of a break, shower and get dressed then head to the theme park. We had so much fun that even now the kids keep begging to go back.",5.0
1591,Water Park only ,Great fun. The kids had a good time. The park could do with more greenery and more variety of different attractions. ,4.0
1592,Good for families with smaller kids,"Legoland is clearly for families with children below 10 years. Some of the attractions are outdated and with staff that lack enthusiasm. Ninjago, which is the newest ride, was the best ride and good for the whole family. The children enjoyed the possibility to have ""unlimited"" access to LEGO bricks and test different vehicles and designs.The 4D movie was a big disappoint and a very cold experience. The sound was bad and it was very difficult to understand the dialogue in the movie. Do not expect too much from the restaurants. They offer typical junk food. 1 days is sufficient. ",3.0

1596,Outing for Kids,"Being the first Lego theme park in Asia, it is indeed very special and attractive to all tourist and local like myself.But may be due to the lego theme so you may find that most of the games and rides are more suitable /designed for younger kids (age 4-10).the water park size is pretty small and that's why i rated this as ""Average "" only.But to a local or Johorian, Annual pass is still worth it as the per month expenses is abt RM20 only",3.0
1597,For the kids,"Went with friends for Halloween, and was expecting the entire park to stay open till late with extended opening hours. It was just part of the park, and the information was severely lacking to visitors.

Oh my, some things have changed, but most things remain the same.Let's see, the layout and shops and eateries are still the same. Most of the rides are still the same. There seems to be some new additions to the park since I last visited, most notably the Ninjago stage show and the Ninjago 4D ride.Most of the park is well maintained and well run. Only gripe would be the Ninjago 4D ride, which didn't have adequate signages to indicate what the ride was about, and we had to queue for like 30mins without really knowing what to expect. Also, the air-conditioning inside the waiting area was quite bad, felt stuffy.Food and beverages prices are OK for a theme park, not too overly expensive. Perhaps Legoland should consider offering cashless transactions as an option for convenience.Truly, the best theme park in Malaysia.",4.0

Great if you are in a hurry or just wanna have fun Lunch is included as well as a staff meme et who walks you around the park and tells you all about Legoland Great day all in all, a lot smaller that other legolands but that's to be expected Great for my kids ages at 8 &9, we have been to the Florida one and the one in California.",5.0
1605,Fun fun fun!,We came as a group of adults and we were enjoying it! Yet kids will enjoy it more compared to us lolThose been to Legoland in US may think this is just a playground or mini Legoland!However we would think it is a bit pricey for a Malaysian if you don't get a good deal from Groupon for example.Unless you are a Lego fan then you would appreciate the art and the collections more than us.In summary it will be just one time visit for me. Cant wait for Fox World in Genting!If you want to enjoy theme park I would prefer Sunway Lagoon better. ,3.0

The ticket is quite expensive, even for Malaysian with MyKad / Maybank card promotion. Compared to initial opening facilities, now there are a lot more options of rides etc. But the place is still lacking of shaded area, hot and humid. More plant / flowers would be nice to balance the hot weather. More structures were added to the mini garden. However, the rides are just satisfying but not too daring for young adult as compared to Universal Studios. Options of foods / restaurants are adequate. More options for parent with toddlers eg playground, internal lego building area, face painting, tattoo making, cupcakes decorations as an alternative if rides are not appealing.",4.0
1608,Best for young families,"Our family of 5, with two early teens, visited Legoland in Dec 16. Unfortunately we were disappointed with the experience. We travelled from Singapore on a day trip, which limited the time we had at the park. The park is in need of a revamp, as the displays were deteriorated and outdated. The rides were more suited to young children, with much of the park set up like a carnival with many sideshow games. Although lines were not long, the flow of patrons was very slow.Meals and drinks are reasonably priced and suitable. A bonus for the park is that they accept SGD, with change given in MYR.

The theming around the hotel really made the experience. We had a view of both parks which were less then 5mins from our room.The hotel was clean and tidy the bathroom had a bday however was western in its function.The hotel was walking distance to a open mall with a Burger King, KFC, 3 convenience stores a Mexican restaurant and a chicken and rice restaurant as well as art displays and a small cluster of street markets. The Taxis were affordable and could take you to several other attractions and outlet shopping for around $20 Australian dollars ( metered).The park it's self was clean bug free ( we saw the once a week spray of park from hotel window. You can take photos and video anywhere and the wait time for rides was short.The park is centered around a mimi lego village which is incredible and features many famous Asian buildings.The rides were fun but tame and accommodates Western figures to about an Australian females size 22 with many rides having a special seat.Our favorite was the Ninjago an interactive game where your hands are usable weapons in a 3d world.The Waterpark was nice due to heat however was really designed for younger family's the wave pool was almost wave less and family waterslide may thrill a 4 year old.Food Bricks restaurant provides an all you can eat buffet with local and western options. For some reason  the western breakfast section contains broccoli and bread and butter pudding as breakfast options. The food is very sweet and opinions like curry seem to be a breakfast only option. As for dinner there is always a kids section, noodle station and desert counters.Don't get caught up just in the hotel however there are plenty of cheap food options in the nearby mall. Ps please try Rainbow bread from the street vendors the softest bread you will ever have and they will make it in to sandwiches for you! It will cost you 5 Ringet which is about $1.5 Australian.The weather we went in winter the rainy season, it didn't rain and it was hot and humid.Cost was cheap when compared to staying in other theme parks however like most places just outside the hotel is a lot cheaper. I would definitely say we got more then our moneys worth and would recommend the trip expecially those with younger kids or Lego fanatics. If however  you are after extreme rides this is not the park for you!",5.0

Malaysians will get a discount and if seniors even more. However, if you book online at least a week earlier, you will get a 20% discount. We only bought the Theme Park ticket. Follow the Park Guide to visit all the attractions. First we visited Lego@ Technic where we were fascinated by the Star Wars Miniland. Great patience and perserverance must have been shown throughout the assembling of the Star Wars setup. Congratulations on the great job. Children will be fascinated with the many rides at Kingdoms. If you want a bird's eye view of Legoland, you must take an Observation Tower ride at Imagination! Next up would be to challenge yourself to take the Dino Island ride at Land of Adventure. However, you need to prevent yourself from getting wet as you plunge downwards  and the sudden abrupt stop will cause water to be splashed into your sitting area. Good luck! Another interesting place would be Miniland. One gets to see such real, similar replicas of Putra Jaya, Twin Towers, Taj Mahal, Forbidden City, Angkor Wat, Hoi An and many more. As Christmas is arriving, we were treated to snow showers at the well decorated  festive mood Snow Village and the great Xmas tree assembled from Lego pieces. We also met Santa Claus and the carolling girls entertaining us with Xmas songs. The children who were handed sweets by Santa Claus  were really happy. Before leaving, we went into the Brick Shop to get lego sets to assemble at home. Wondering when we would come up with at least a Lego masterpiece. As it was Christmas Eve, the park close at 7:30pm  and when we were about to leave Santa Claus and company were at the exit points to greet everyone.

We went anyway with my parents and not expecting much as he is a big lego fan especially the modular sets.Getting there was easy as we stayed across the road. Bought the tickets online and skip the line straight to bag check and then we were in. The park map is not user friendly and very hard to find your way around. Would be great and more fun for kids if they marked the pathway to each area. We were here just before Christmas. It was busy but not crazy. The only ride we decided to bUl out was the 4D as it has a really really long line right up to outside the Q parameter. Most rides we waited 10min or less.We went around and did most of the rides. It is true that the theme park is targeted for younger kids, it only couple of them excites older/teenage kids. Could have provide building area and challenges for older kids, easily, as my son would like to sit down and built something but the room just full of prams and toddlers.The park needs more water fountain and shelter from the sun between rides as it can get really hot and humid.In saying that, we all young at heart with low expectations of the park and we did enjoy our trip and best ride of all for us is the Ninjago as even my parents joined in and enjoyed it!

1619,Family Vacation,"It was ok but not great. Some attractions and facilities like the train ride, the boat ride was mulfunctioned. The management should have settled the problems before the next operation day. People came and paid not to see ""malfunctioned"" facilities. Not expecting return visit in the future. ",3.0
1620,Good fun!,"Visited with Family in December, we choose to drive and park at the Medini mall car park and after a short walk reached the entrance, we also had some offers which gave us a 30% discount. We were in the park by 9:40 AM. Park opens at 9:30 AM. headed to the imagination area, but most of the rides were not opening till 10:30 AM. The Lego city allows lego land hotel stayers and annual pass holders to visit first and the rest are only allowed later. We decided to check out the mini models of the cities and then headed off for some rides soon after. My son enjoyed the activities in the Lego City which included driving cars, boats playing fireman and other rides.Also had fun on the multiple roller coasters including the awesome on on the Technic area. Food was expensive in the park and so were the official pics at the rides.Overall it was a great day spent. was dead tired at the end of the day!We visited only the dry park except for two rides all the others are dry. bring a change of clothes if you want to stay dry after the rides. We ended our day with the two wet rides.",4.0
1621,Awesome family trip,We went before the school holidays began so it wasn't as crowded as usual. We spent the first day at the water park and rode the ride until we couldn't climb the stairs anymore. Loads of fun. The crew were friendly and sporting. Cleanliness was a priority so I wasn't too concerned about my family getting any water diseases. We visited the dry park the next day and had a blast. Our kids enjoyed themselves so much and rode all the rides many many times. The new Ninjago ride was fun for the small kids.,5.0
1622,Visited last time,"This place is located in Nusajaya some where above Bukit Indah. To get to Legoland, you need to travel along the east coast road. This place is mainly for children. Most of the rides are mostly for small kids, there is some rides adults can't take. At that time I went, they were still upgrading the place, so there was not many rides available.",3.0
1623,Thank you for maintaining the water park well!,Still exciting! This is our 3rd time to the water park and I was skeptical that it will still be maintain well and most important CLEAN! I am happy to report the wet park is CLEAN! and the rides were well managed! We went on a weekday and it was perfect! No need to compete with the crowd and it was very enjoyable! :),4.0
1624,Have a great fun in this school holiday!,"We spent a day at the dry park and unfortunately it rained in the afternoon, so some of the outdoor activities/ rides not able to play. This time around, we did not go to water park, will suggest to do 1 day at dry and 1 day at water park. The theme park is huge and some rides need about max. 10mins waiting time (not too bad). Recommend family with children age 6yo and above because majority of the ride minimum requirement is 110cm or 6yo and above or both height and age met. Therefore my 5yo girl was a bit disappointed that she couldn't take certain ride. Overall, it is still a fun and enjoyable holiday for the kids and adults! ",4.0

1628,Quiet theme park,"We went to Legoland many times, Sept 2016 was the last time we went. The park seem to quiet down a lot, not many people...which was good for the kids as they need not Q up for rides. F&B pricing reasonable.",4.0
1629,A Fun Day in Legoland!,"I went to legoland in johor bahru on 10th December 2016 with my family. ticket price you guys can go and check it out on their website. To me it's quite pricey as i went there with all my family members. so imagine how much money we spent there for the tickets only! luckily, it's not my money. hahahah so we went for the theme park only. the first 30 minutes, i felt a bit boring as most of the games and rides were design for kids below 12 which makes my nephews and niece were madly happy!...but once I got deeper into the park, i started to discovered lots of rides that heart thrilling and exciting, which was perfect for adults! Here are few rides that I manage to tried and recommended for you (adults and kids), do try if you come to this theme park; 1- boating school 2- beetle bounce (similar to space shot in Genting but much shorter) 3- Dino Island (prepare to get wet! bring extra shirts or raincoat) this is one of the most thrill and fun rides. i repeat twice and totally wet! 4- Ninjago rides (rides with game. make sure to collect highest point) 5- lost kingdom adventure (laser tag kind of game) 6- observation tower (beautiful scenery) 7- Dragon apprentice (mini roller coaster) 8- Aquazone (prepare to get wet) 9- kids power tower (strength needed) 10- the dragon (roller coaster) 11- Technic twister (similar to spinning cup ride) 12- Project X (the most thrill ride in Legoland!) i repeat this ride twice then feels like crying! 13- miniland (building in miniature Lego size) 14- Lego academy (certificate for lego master) 15- lego city stage (don't forget to catch at least one of the live shows there. totally worth and full with awesomeness!) 16- Lego star wars (if you are a fan, then go for it!) never thought that I could have so much fun in Legoland. the live show is something that you can't miss! tips: -if you planning to bring your kids, make sure your kids is 6 years old and above plus 120cm in height and above so that you can play with your kids for almost every single rides and games. -outside foods are not allowed in the theme park. they will open and check your bag..each and every of your bag. so if you want to brings some foods, make sure to hide it well. price for the foods inside the legoland are pricey so brace yourself to spend lots and lots of money okay! to sum up, Legoland is great for kids and adults! so have fun!",4.0
1630,enjoyable day,"This place is awesome.the kids loved it.We have been here multiple times and the kids never get bored with the rides.The staffs are helpful and accommodating.Lots of place to sit throughout the park,a plus point for pregnant ladies and senior citizens.",5.0
1631,Great theme park for kids around 8-10 years old,"Our kids are 8 & 10 yrs old, and Legoland was perfect for them. Some theme parks aim more at teenagers, others more at toddlers, this was just right for us at this stage!",5.0
1632,Too hot,"Considering that this attraction has been around for a few years, it seems that it is still a very hot place due to not enough shades or where there are shades, there are no fans available except maybe when you are queuing for rides.The rides are fun enough for young kids and adults too. The Santa lego's appearance was the highlight of our visit as we danced with Santa and Gingerbread Man while a lady (with a good voice) was singing a happy Christmas Song (I cannot remember which song now).",4.0

1634,Lots of fun!,"We had never visited any of the Legolands before so did not know what to expect. Managed to avoid all the queues as Malaysian school holidays were finished. As adults, we were finished with Legoland after one day, but our 5 year old loved it so much we went back for second day. Also for families who like to come prepared they don't allow food or drink (water is ok) to be taken into Legoland. Much cheaper to book online in advance, or through a hotel.  Overall a really fun place to go!",4.0
1635,"child friendly, plenty of fun, unlimited rides (on most)","Huge park to explore, most rides are free and the toilets are very, very clean. Extremely child and baby friendly too. The weather was hot, but we can't help that :) Would come again with the kids!",4.0

1639,Fun for ALL ages,"There was so much to see and do that if you want to do the water park too you need 2 days! We did it in 1 and found so much for our almost 3 year old to do... definitely worth the visit even if it is quite expensive, you get a lot for your money. My son especially loved the water boats, junior driving school, lego horse riding and beetle bounce.  Some rides were for his age but too scary for him so good to get an adult to try them out first if the line isn't too long.",5.0
1640,Good Theme Park,"This is the first Legoland Theme Park in Asia. The concept of the park is suitable for all ages.  The theme Park : The roller coaster rides are suited more for 9-10 years and below as they are quite mild.  There's not much shades in the park, so it is very hot. Eating places & seats are not plenty as expected for a theme park. So, if eat early before the crowd starting to queue up.The Water Park : It's a very nice water park.  My daughters enjoyed the rides and the man-made river.Beware of the kids nagging wanting to buy legos legos and legos...you probably will spend much more money buying the legos than on anything else here.",4.0
1641,Great to age 9,"Of course, this is a great place to visit if you have never been to a Legoland. We did a day trip from Singapore. It was a fun day.Pros: Lego statues, variety of rides, not terrible foods, easy to navigate.Cons: rides and activities geared to younger kids (9 yo got bored), very hot, Lego in the open areas showing signs of age, no bargains to justify carrying Lego in luggage. We opted out of the water park because it was pretty small and our trip was limited. Legoland had a couple of water rides already.I would allow a maximum of one full day, unless you really want a water park experience. Go soon though, if it gets more run down it will look shabby.",4.0
1642,1st theme park visit out of the country with my mom,"We came here September 2013, my first out of the country with my mom and this is our 1st stop as i love themed parks. food is average, rides are not that impressive, but not bad. it wasn't a peak time to visit so we never had problem on queue, they offer discounts to my mom as she is above 60 (which is great, just show them the passport as proof). The waterpark isn't open that time, would like to visit again.",3.0
1643,Highly overpriced and waste of time ,"We visted there with our friends family and 4 kids 12 , 8,7 and 2 yrs old . We drove down from KL starting around 6 and reached there by 9:30 . The adventure park is still slightly better but the water park is absolutely waste of space , money and time . It should be definitely avoided . After so much hype there are hardly any rides which u could enjoy , plus the killer was that u are suppose to hand carry the heavy , big tubes all the way up to the start of the rides ur self . The water bucket in the water park was also not working. Only some saving grace in water park is the build ur own raft . All other rides are pathetic . We were actually free by 6 pm and could have easily driven back to KL same day , if we hadn't already booked our self into a hotel . This place should be avoided at all cost. ",1.0
1644,Nice if it is not too crowded,"We came to the park a bit late, around 11 am, and its already very crowded eventhough it was Tuesday and not the weekend. The annual pass redemption process also took a lot of time and my kid already cranky for waiting too long.Came to the park with long queue everywhere.Miniland already showing wear and tear. The train is not in operation. Ninjago ride experiencing some technical trouble that make the queue even longer.Overall the park is good for kid pre-teenager. What I dont like: the food is really overpricedsome tips:Come there before 10 when the queue is short and not that hot. Select indoor game during noon until 2 PM, unless you will got sunburn",3.0
1645,Nice Decor but no as good as we thought,"Lego themed hotel will nice decoration. However, the place seems to be overcrowded at times. Swimming pool is not as good as we thought too",3.0
1646,Nice area and hotel,"I did not go inside the park itself, but did check out the Legoland hotel.  It's really an attraction by itself.  Never seen so many Lego themed items and if you are at the hotel, check out the lifts - they have different disco themes...and quite fun.  The wonders on what Lego bricks can do is amazing.  There is a waterpark next to the normal theme park.",4.0
1647,"Great for pre-teens, needs better maintenance","Just came back from a 3 day trip to Legoland Malaysia with family (wife + 3 yr old + 4 month old).  For anyone planning a Legoland holiday, I highly recommend staying at the Legoland Hotel.  The convenience will more than double your enjoyment.  Pls see my separate review for the Legoland Hotel.The family, especially my 3 yr old, had an awesome time.  If you ever wondered how to entertain a young child until they literally collapse from exhaustion (wonderful for adults to have a proper night's sleep), bring them here.  The park caters primarily for young children 3 - 12 yrs old.  At 3 my daughter can ride less than 50% of the rides due to age/height restrictions, but she had a lots of fun on the rides she could go on.  The park is a good starter park for kids so they don't freak out when they go to more adult-themed parks e.g. Universal Studios.  The adjoining water park is a must, as I've never met a kid who didn't like water play.  Again, the park is designed mostly with young children in mind.  My daughter squealed herself hoarse in the huge wave pool with large screen shows.  There was a supersized water playground with 7 levelled slides.  The gentle flowing river was perfect for just lying in a donut inflatable (provided) and floating down the river with the simulated current.Now for the downsides.  Maintenance is a big problem.  From breakdowns (some appearing permanent since grass has grown over the tracks) to cleanliness and discolouration from the weather.  It's not a disaster zone, but Legoland should do a better job keeping things clean and humming.  Even the brand new Ninjago ride (opened for 1 month only!) broke down for 30 min while we were in queue.  When I asked what was the problem, the friendly staff replied that it was no problem - they just needed to reset the system several times. ??!  So they have no idea what's wrong nor do they bother to find out?!Tip: the best deal on tickets are for hotel guests - RM225 for 2 day all access.",4.0
1648,Comfy walking shoes needed for long walks,"I felt I lost a lot of weight just walking around and sweating so much due to the hot weather. My son and I kept going back to the Legoland restaurant to replenish ourselves with lots of drinks.... water, juice and soda! Visitors were not allowed to bring any food so their restaurants can sell to the them. However, the staff allow the guests to bring water. If we brought our bottled water, we would have saved a lot of money on drinks.There were rides and amazing sculptors and architecture made up of lego. I just got so exhausted from the irritable hot weather that I couldn't focus on appreciating the art works made of lego. Those who are interested to visit this place, get ready with your hat, sunglasses, umbrella and comfortable shoes for long walks!",3.0
1649,Legoland,Great fun and food for families with children under 12. Give yourself two days to enjoy all the activities in the theme park and waterworld. Service with a smile was an added bonus (especially after spending a week in Singapore).,5.0
1650,Time for some repair works & upgrading,Went there recently with my 4 kids (range from 3 - 11yo). They had fun but i noticed that some the rides and the lego displays looked dirty and old. Our wheather here really can really deteriote them pretty fast and legoland mgmt should be very well aware of these conditions. One of the rides was not even working (the train). Looks like it was under maintenance quite awhile.The park has not reached it 10th mark yet..but it looks like it. Look after it guys! Don't be too worried about the money. But the staff are well trained and courteous and full of energy. Hats off to them! ,3.0
1651,Theme Park for the kids,"Its a great place of fun mostly catered for the kids. If you are looking for more exhilarating and adrenaline pumping rides, this is not the place. The part that attracts me the most is the minilands built of legos.",4.0
1652,The theme park was great!,"Visited Legoland with my wife and 2 sons. (3 years old and 1 year old). The theme park was great as we were there during non peak season. However, as my son is just 3 years old, he can't enjoy many of the rides due to height restrictions. The restaurant was served good food at reasonable price if you take the meal set. We only leave the theme park for water park at 4 PM. The water park on the other hand had lots of maintenance work going on. So, we spent most of the time at the huge pool with artificial wave facing the Legoland sign. I do think that 1 day combo ticket is not worth it as the theme park alone requires 1 full day to complete. Overall, it was a good experience. Will dfinitely be back for the theme park when our kids gained height. ",4.0
1653,"Fun, fun, fun","Legoland Malaysia has lots of fun rides. It is suitable for young kids ..the rides are not dangerous the water park has better exciting rides. However, need to queue for some floats and then walk up to the slides. ",5.0
1654,Good family fun especially for younger children,"We came to Legoland for the day and since it was the school holidays for both Singapore and Malaysia, we were expecting there to be large crowds. Luckily we chose to do Legoland on a Sunday instead of Saturday and there were less crowds and queues. Nice theme park for younger kids - more suitable for kids between the ages of 6 to 12.  Rides are interesting and fun for kids in that age bracket - older kids would find the park not ""exciting"" enough.They had the normal theme park rides with 2 roller coasters, some other theme park rides and bumper cars, etc. There is a mini world where famous landmarks around the world such as Taj Mahal is constructed using legos.  The newest 3D Ninjago ride is an interactive ride where you are basically shooting at ninjas onscreen with hand actions while riding on the car.They have a wet park next door with a large pool and a couple of large water slides and a floating Lego river.There are a few restaurants inside the Legoland park but we were told that with our prebooked online tickets, we were able to get out of the park and get back in.  The mall of medini is next to Medini and has more food choices and restaurants.A good day out with the kids - just don't expect it to be filled with thrilling roller coasters and wild rides as this park is targeted for younger kids (i.e. pre-teens).",4.0
1655,LEGOLAND BORING,"If you're travelling from SG to Malaysia just to see and visit LEGOLAND. I advised you to change your mind and stay at SG instead. The long journey is not worth it! First, you have to fall in line for hours at the immigration from SG to Malaysia and vise versa. Second, the online bus ticket going to Malaysia is a little bit expensive. Third, Legoland is booooring. Only kids can enjoy Legoland since most of its attractions are intended for them.  My expectation about legoland is high, higher than what I expected for Universal studios. I was expecting that there were adventurous and heart-pumping rides. But then when we got there I was disappointed. Rides are not so thrilling and there are few things for adults. So if you're looking for thrill rides, you cannot find it here. Better book for Universal Studios in SG.",3.0
1656,Very average theme park,"While there is a variety of activities and rides at Legoland Malaysia, what is most daunting is the lack of careful planning for sufficient shade. I went to legoland Malaysia when it first opened and the trees and shade issue is still the same. In a scorching tropical country like Malaysia, there must be sufficient shade so that visitors can enjoy the theme park. Suffice to say I was not enjoying myself much as it was too hot most of the time. The park cast members are also rather lethargic and slow, so be prepared to wait. Upkeep of rides is wanting, and the rides have definitely seen better days. For example, for the toddler car rides, only 3-4 were cars were functioning and there was a long wait. Food wise there is a variety to choose from - prices are theme park expensive (no surprise) so be prepared. There is the medini mall right outside now with KFC and a lot of other food establishments so that can be an option. I won't say Legoland is comparable to other theme parks like Universal Studios or Disneyland (definitely not), but it's something different I guess. ",3.0
1657,Most memorable trip ever,"This is our second visit to Legoland. The experience was still fantastic. If you are bringing kids, the minute they spot the resort, it will take their breaths away. Stay in the resort for at least 2 nights and get the 2 day combo park tickets to experience the wonder of the place. There are plenty of activities for the kids in the hotel. They just have to sign up for them at the lobby. The rooms were perfect, with surprise gifts for the kids, separate room for adults and televisions for both. The theme park rides hardly had any queues despite being the long school holidays. The rides have the right amount of thrills for children without being overly frightening. The staff were friendly and helpful. What made this year's visit better was the discounts and offers for the lego toys and meals in the park, certificate of participation and souvenirs e.g. button badges for the kids when they signed up for the hotel activities. Hope these will continue. Really, really tempted to go again. ",5.0
1658,So much fun,"We pre purchased tickets online and taxied from Johor Bahru which was convenient to skip the ticket window que and cheaper than organised tours. Did the theme park one day and water park two days later which gave us plenty of time at both. We hired a gazebo at the water park for RM480 full day which included drinks, souvineers, 4xtowels aircon and digital safe - excellent value for a full day of family fun.",5.0

We first visited the dry park from 1030 to 1430 , covered almost all rides and my 7 year old Son had a blast, not many adventurous ones but mostly family rides.Miniature lego city and monumental lego buildings are amazing for clicks.Wet park was fun and we were there from 1500-1730 . Slides and the family raft rides are fun, make sure you carry appropriate clothing, read the park rules in website.Took back our reserved bus at 1830 and reached Singapore around 2100.Overall a nice day out with family",4.0
1665,What can say? It was great,"Not sure about others. To us it was fun. My boy tried most of the ride except the technics. When we reach it, he was really exhausted. But it was worth it.His favourite was the ninjago.he still talking about it. There's lots of rides to try. As we came during a weekday, we managed to get all the rides without waiting. Too bad the boating school was under maintaince but its was ok the other rides was great.The 4 d cinema was a nice break away from the heat before our lunch.All the staff is friendly. For my family and I it w√†s well worth the money if you calculate how many rides we took and how much it would have cost if we had to pay individually. Legoland is suitable from kids 7 years and above. Below that they might not enjoy it.Some advice:-1. Make sure u have enough cash cause there 's little kiosk around the park selling food and beverages. There is also little fun fair games around there. Most food outlets accept cash2. There is a atm machine at the entrance next to the ticketing booth. Its quite hidden.3. Dont bring any food or beverages cause you will get stopped at the entrance. So far they let us bring our baby formula in4. Bring caps and umbrella some areas are really hot.5. Ninja go is a must try",5.0
1666,Two days of Fun for the kids,"We got a 2 day pass for Legoland Thempark and Waterpark for the kids.Legoland was fun for the kids, but when we were there end of October, it was the start of rainy season and Legoland mostly outdoors, some of the rides will close due to Thunderstorms or rainshowers, even light rain.  The kids were able to enjoy additional perks, which was ""brick or treating"" for Halloween, they were able to get some freebies from sponsors and a souvenir lego brick for Dewali (Deepavali).Due to the stoppage of quite a few rides, the kids were not able to try everything at the end of the day, which was a bummer.  They wanted to go back the next day, but the ticket was for the day only, next day was for the water park only. For an adult, not all rides in Legoland are available.  So it was not as fun for me as bigger themparks like Universal or Disneyland. The next day, at the Waterpark, Adults can enjoy though!  The kids of course enjoyed a lot!  It was my first time to go swimming in a Muslim country, so I chose to be a bit discreet and used a rash guard, in fact the whole family had rash guards.  There were however some Men who chose to be ""top less"".  They are very strict about eyeglasses, watches and waterproof cameras on the big slides though, so best not to bring them if you are going for the big slides!  We had to leave everything on top, and I had to climb back up to collect them. Food for both parks are not bad, in terms of cost and taste, they should accept credit cards, but when we were there, the credit card machines all do not work for some reason, so we had to pay in cash.If you are a Grab or an Uber fan, you can use them to and from Legoland.",4.0

We love Toy Story, Lost Kingdom, etc type rides where you ride and shoot at things... the new Ninjago ride at Legoland has a twist that one-ups the best of the best.  Well done!We also liked the Rescue Academy, Build & Test, and Driving/Boat Schools. Some of the kiddy rides are for 3 or 4 year olds only. In Universal Studios Sentosa the younger kids have more options.  Luckily there are a lot of playgrounds for toddlers, but there were many disappointments throughout the day...Also, Christmas decor and shows don't really work at >30C & %97 humidity...",4.0

Highly recommended !!!",5.0
1671,Going Back to Childhood,"I had visited Legoland in the UK and whilst in Singapore I thought for a day trip it would be a good idea to go to Legoland for a different experience.

We certainly enjoyed the rides and activities as much as the children.",4.0

Still had fun, and it's our first time to experience Legoland.But we will not go back there again. Waste of money and time because of the transportation.",4.0
1673,Legland - Midweek,"Clearly one for the kids.Amenities were plentiful, convenient and clean. Rides were safe and entertaining. Mid-week queues were bearable but weekends are less so.Not unexpectedly, the many food outlets were relatively expensive and of limited nutritional value - take your own.Plenty of parking - although we arrived and departed by taxi.Overall, an average theme park.",3.0
1674,A place mainly for kids but adults can enjoy too,"Legoland is mainly targeted at kids, wherein there are certain attractions that forbid 2 adults from taking it together and must be separated. However, I went there with my boyfriend and we both still enjoyed it a lot. We skipped 3-4 rides which were too kiddy but still managed to stay a whole day in the theme park as there was an abundance of things to do, for example the 4D movie theatre showing 5 different 4D movies, 1 every 30 minutes which took up a majority of our time there. We also took the interactive 4D Ninjago ride twice coz it was so much fun trying to break the high score.There are places to take photos throughout the theme park too. Even the game booths were quite fun, with many of them offering guaranteed prizes as long as you play. Plenty of people were holding a soft toy when they left from playing the games. Though, all of the guaranteed soft toys were not nice IMO, with the really nice ones being near impossible to win.There are many things which could be improved though:1. There is no water dispenser anywhere. None at all. Which was a major disappointment as food and drinks sold there were almost twice the usual price outside of Legoland so we didn't want to buy any. I have been to many theme parks in many countries and this is the only theme park that does not have water dispenser.2. Maintenance could be improved. Some gadgets were broken and we could also see maintenance work going on in Miniland. Doesn't affect enjoyment that much though.3. The 4D movies were quite subpar. We were not the only ones who felt so, I heard other customers commenting on it as well. The 4D effect was only wind, burst of smoke in front of the screen and the occasional soap bubbles falling to camouflage as snow. The movie plots were great, but these effects didn't really enhance our experience of the movie much as they seemed quite amateur.4. This may be tough to improve but the surrounding of Legoland does not excite customers who just stepped foot to the place. It looks like an abandoned construction site on the outside and we had to walk quite some distance to finally see the grand entrance of Legoland. I heard other uncles complaining about the walking distance as well. It might have been more bearable if you made the surrounding more exciting.5. There were a lot of mosquitoes at the Kids Power Tower attraction. We just wanted to enjoy the attraction but ended up with mosquito bites in just a few minutes.6. It was hard to hear the commentary in the Observation Tower. The voice was too soft.Before I end this review, I would like to applaud the effort of the staff there to make the rides more exciting. Also the staff in the guest service area which who was so polite, and the random photographers who took photo for us with our camera for free. If only the official photos weren't so expensive (RM60 each piece!) we would have bought it!",4.0
1675,Legoland Malaysia,"So much to do for adults, teens and even my little boy. To top it all everything is safe. We have wonderful memories of the place. Must visit if you are in Johor Bahru.We unfortunately did not visit the water park as it rained the whole day when we planned to go.",5.0
1676,Be careful if you are coming from Singapore,"My son loved the whole experience, unfortunately what wrecked it for us was getting across the boarder from Singapore...huge delays with customs via public transport (took hours both ways), might be a different if you drive over. The other thing that I found a bit misleading is they advertise that you if you stay at the hotel you get early entry into the park which is correct but it only gets you into the very first part and Lego City which is for young ones, my son is almost 8 and wants to ride the rollers coasters but none of that opened up until 10am....there is no great rush to get in there by 9:30am unless you have a little one.",4.0
1677,fun under the sun,"great place for kids . eventhough not much for adults but seeing the kids enjoying is more than enough. the water park is icing on the cake because of the hot weather,,,when we took a dip it was awesome. have some decent eateries within the premises u can try.",4.0
1678,Amazing Lego Concept,Buy your tickets online to avoid standing in queue for long. Fun rides for all especially for the kids. ,5.0
1679,"Okay for a short vacay, prepare enough money","To start, everything is pricey. You need to know how to fix your budget. There are not many rides for adults. In waterpark you can try all of the slides, but in the themepark itself the rides that I find considering as fun for adults would be the roller coasters, dino island ride, and of course ninjago ride. Most of the rides cater for small kids. Others would be ""meh"". Breakdown for price lists:1. Food are pricey. A cup of cold milo is RM6, and 3 pieces of fried chicken in waterpark is RM27. Get combo (in pasta mania at imagination park, combo B comes with 2x soft drinks, 1 salad and 1 10 inch aloha chicken pizza). 2. Pictures that was shot during a ride (during roller coaster ride for an example) is RM60 for an 8R size (1 pic only). The price will hike up to RM120 for other options.3. Other items such as a t-shirt with a simple legoland wording and logo printed is RM69.90, a small lego figure keychain is RM24.9, a water tumbler is around RM39.90. 4. In waterpark, you can rent a cabana or a gazebo. Cabana is RM300 for 1 whole day or RM180 for half day, and it comes with 1 mini fridge fills with 10 bottles of mineral water, 2 legoland towels, 2 reclining chairs and 2 chairs, and a safe deposit box. There is a fan inside the cabana. (Max 4 person in the cabana) 5. For the gazebo, 1 whole day price is RM480. However, if you are lucky, you will get a discounted price for RM360 instead. Provided are 2 reclining chairs, 2 chairs, 4 mineral water bottles, 4 soft drinks, 4 selected other beverages (all in the minifridge), 2 complimentary mocktail, 4 legoland towels, 4 souvenirs, and 2 water tumblers. Fully encolose gazebo with an aircond, a fan, charging ports, safe deposit box, a locker, and wifi for 2 devices. Rent a gazebo if you want a total privacy.6. Dry pods are available to dry off body after rides that will get soaked (dino ride). Per drying session is RM10. The pod is big enough for 5 adults in it.Overall it is a satisfying experience although the weather could be unpredictable. It usually rains in the evening hence get there when the park opens at 10am and enjoy the most anticipated rides first (ninjago and project X roller coaster). For the waterpark, no cotton shirt is allowed when you want to use slides. Only materials that is similar to a jersey is allowed. No camera, gopros, watches, phones, glasses and even goggles are allowed in all slides. For themepark rides, bags, cameras, and gopros are not allowed. Bring your own umbrella and ponchos.",3.0

1683,....more than choo choo trains and merry go rounds,"Admittedly my perception of this park was preconceived to be an attraction more suited to pre teenaged kids. This was due to having seen an ad featuring it when it first opened.Pleasantly I was proved wrong. There was a whole lot more. Naturally it cannot be compared to what is offered in the USA but nevertheless I had a great time . The water theme park was such fun too.What impressed me was that the park was well managed and it was clear that safety for visitors and staff alike was given it's due priority.It was clean and all the personnel were diligent,friendly and polite.I was also impressed with the food that was served there. Sure it was a bit pricey but the meals we had (burgers and fried chicken) was better than average ,fresh and definitelt NOT ""plastic-ky"" like that  compared to the food offered at normal fast food chains.To elaborate, the patties were made of ""real"" mince meat and the tastiness of the meat was NOT due to over seasoning but because of it's freshness.The park was nicely landscape however it could do with a bit more shade which I think will come when the trees mature.I especially liked all the Lego lifesized figures and of course the city and miniland exhibit. The detail of which was both impressive and beautifully executed.Quite frankly I had a better time here than I did at Universal Studio Singapore when I made my visit there 2 years ago.",4.0

She also get a badge, key chain and a card that we can cut the line.When we eat at burger store, she get free mug. And everystaff in there wish a happy birthday to her and make my daughter happy.We go to legoland using uber transportation from our hotel at danga bay early morning. The ticket counter open at 9.30am. And we come out at 6.00pm.There a lot game for children but adult can join also.

1693,Ninjago performance and ride the highlight,"We did a day trip from Singapore on a Sunday. The border crossing at Tuas was very quick.There were very few people at Legoland, even for Singapore based persons the entrance fee was on the high side. The Ningago performance and ride were the highlights.The park felt a little on the tired side, worth the trip but not an annual pass",4.0
1694,Fun Place for Big and Small Kids,"We had 3 days of fun at Legoland and the kids were entertained by the variety of things to do from waterslides, to roller coasters, to opportunities to build and race lego cars and trucks.The food on the park is very reasonably priced compared to Australia and there are lots of air conditioned buildings to sit down in.  I would highly recommend it for a short break, especially if it is combined with a stay at the hotel, which is fantastic fun for big and small kids alike.",5.0
1695,Relaxing trip,"Went on a Thursday before school holidays.  Park was not crowded with maximum 5 mins queue.  Although park is not big but it took us 7 hours to cover most of the rides.  We skipped some kiddo and scary rides.  Most rides are kids friendly except 2 of them which I find scary - Project X and the dragon.Took the latest Ninjago 4D Ride twice but twice it experience technical fault halfway. Perhaps luck was not on our side.     Weather was fine except in the late afternoon with thundery showers.  Outdoor rides were stopped and only indoor rides were opened.  Wanted to take Ninjago 4D ride again but it was crowded then due to the bad weather.  End up we did not take it.Just a piece of advice - Trade your lego minifigure with only those staff you find trusted.  We made a mistake by trading with a cleaner in Lego land hotel, she was wearing a fake lego miniifigure and we did not know it.  We traded our original with her fake one.  We only found out when the staff told us.  They taught us how to differentiate an original and fake one.  Original has lego logo on all body parts.  So please trade with open eyes.Overall we enjoy our theme park trip.       ",3.0
1696,Fun trip out of singapore,"Went to Legoland Malaysia in October as we found ourselves having a free day without nothing else planned. We were told over the phone that bus tickets have sold out but we can try our luck and go to the Singapore Flyer early in the morning which we did. The first bus was sold out but we were able to get the last few seats on the next bus. We had a lovely 4hr visit in the park, it was enjoyable even for two adults without kids. Highlight was the river ride which we did at the end because we knew we will get wet. Unfortunately, the immigration process going back to SG was not smooth, it took us two hours for everyone on the bus to be cleared so make sure you factor this in when making plans in the evening.",4.0
1697,Denied bringing light snacks,"We arrived early as we stayed in the Legoland hotel. At the entrance there is a security check of your bags, and upon discovery of some croissant and buns, we were denied entry and asked to leave the food stuffs outside the park like your cars or your hotel room. Such inconvenience! What is this policy of no food? It's not major lunch meals but just very light snacks for the little ones. So we had to turn back and drop the FOODSTUFFS in the hotel room.NO A GOOD START.Further it's a secure check but looking for food?",1.0
1698,Loved it,"A 2.5 hour visit was enough to explore the dry area of this park and we enjoyed. It was clean, fun, and less crowded when we went there and since there was no queue, we got to ride more than once without leaving our seats to go back to the line. The mini city of the park is amazing and intricate details made it special. Overall, we loved the theme park and would definitely go back especially at low season to maximize our visit.",5.0
1699,Who doesn't love Lego?!,"If your answer is 'no' then Legoland probably isn't for you. It is a well suited holiday destination for a family with young children below 12 as I think the older kids will tire of the activities pretty quickly. The rides are focused primarily for the young ones, opposite to other theme parks that usually have a small kiddy section. Great, as finally my kids (age 2 & 4) can do most of rides instead of the usual few. A nice part I like is the Lego City where the children can drive cars in a driving school and boats and play fireman. The theme park is well maintained with clean toilets and rides. The staff are friendly with a ready smile and on the three occasions I've been there aren't much crowds, so pretty much no queueing and a pleasant relaxing experience. And for those staying in Singapore, it's very convenient from the Tuas checkpoint. About 10-15 mins drive from Malaysia customs, with clear road signs to Legoland so you don't need a gps.",4.0

1701,Heaven for children,"Visited this place with hubby and 2 kids( 11 years) . My kids are kind of "" scaredy cat"" . Too pampered. Theme park:  Overall this place cater to children from toddler to maybe about 15 years old children. Any children more than 15 years old will kind of find this place abit kiddy. ( I think) The rides are not too hair raising or horrifying for my kids their age. No bags of any kind even the smallest one are allowed on the ride. Just before every ride they have an area where you can drop off your bag next to the staffs before you hop on the carriage. Pick it up after the ride. Some of the rides you'll get soaking wet like the dino island ride. So those of you who don't like to get wet get ready your ponchos . However they have body dryer everywhere . It's cost RM 10 per usage, for about 7 - 10 mins, ( you don't get dry anyway) we didn't visit Lego city course it's kind of kiddy for my kids but the rest is great.Water park:It's the highlights for the children. The children slides area is fantastic compare to Sunway lagoon. The amount of life guards they have here are enormous. Practically every corner you see a life guard. All the slides landing area ends in the same area regardless which slides they take, so parents can get a good supervision just staying put in one area. Every slide there is a life guard to monitor. Even the kiddy pool of 0.4 m have 3 lifeguards on duty. Safety here are tip top. The wave pool deepest is only 1.2 m. So older children like mine are okay. Life jackets are a plenty . It's self service. Ride on rafts are not too horrifying for the children as well. It's a kid friendly place compare to Sunway lagoon which caters more for teenagers.",5.0

1719,Day trip for the kids ,Traveling from Singapore was frustrating especially when on a bus as you need to get off to produce passport to leave singapore then again entering Malaysia  and wait in a line for longer than you want. Not only is it hot and if lucky get a slight breeze from one fan blowing the heat around but the staff are in no rush and not friendly making your wait seem even longer.  Definitely dont need a whole day in legoland and not alot to offer my one year old  and the only thing my 15 year old really enjoyed was the water rides.Very disappointed that i couldn't take my pram into any building and there was nowhere to go to cool down. Expected to see more lego status but not many at all which seems strange considering it's legoland so really didnt think it was worth it and wont be going again. The bus tour driver on the way back to Singapore was extremely rude and ignored people's questions and acted as if its a inconvenience for him to be there in the first place so as far as im concerned it was more money wasted on him. Highlight was the water ride.,3.0
1720,Out Of Blocks.,"Loved the size of the park which would provide a great workout to anyone anyday. Although Malaysia's weather play a big part in enjoying the most of it. It's either scorching hot or a wet walk all round. Rides are designed for the toddlers and its great that parents are able to join the little ones too. It's quiet when the family was there but the overall experience is marred by the working crew that is quite non-responsive to queries and not helping to build excitement. The shows were a highlight for us but the local narrators did little to spark it off. Overall, it's a worthy visit tho more activities in closer range may help a little more.",3.0
1721,Great park !,My husband and I took our 7 year old on a day tour from Singapore.  I booked a one day combo (theme park and water park) ticket and also private transfers.The private transfer option was fantastic (expensive $250sgd return) for our own driver.  We didn't have to wait at customs or even get out of the car in either direction our driver just passed our passports over and they processed it quickly for me this was worth it.The park was fantastic and we all had a great time. I think it is suited for under 10's so it was great for us.  We went on a Monday and it was very quiet we hardly had to wait for any rides.The water park was also great fun my son loved the water slides.A lot of the Lego was the same price as at home but we got a few different ones we haven't seen before.,5.0

The most amazing is dino island.. We've get lucky because it's cloudy with no rain on our visit day.. On shiny day, sunblock, hats, umbrella will be definitely needed. Bring your own stroller if visiting with young children, because they must be too exhausted traversing the park, and you will be too if should carrying them on.

I understand all is out in the weather but so disappointed to see majority either faded or discoloured and yet still charging high cost for entry.

Try to alternate between indoor/outdoor that way you get to stay out of the sun and also get an a/c environment. The Theater was good check the show timings and dont miss it.  4D Movie are worth visiting multiple times as they show different movies.Tip: Outside food and water is allowed , inside its very expensive.",5.0
1733,Wow. Amazing time for 6 year old and parents!,"Fantastic. Never had to queue for longer than 10 mins. Every ride was brilliant fun. We loved the mini land too. Star wars exhibition was amazing.

Soooo much fun. Perfect on a hot day. Don't hesitate just go. We will be back",5.0
1734,For big and little kids,"A good family activity especially if you have Lego fans. I've been to lots of parks worldwide so while Legoland Malaysia isn't that big and with fewer number of rides and activities, it's still worth going with the kids. It's good enough to tire out  bunch of 5-9 year old kids (and their parents).Younger children (5-9) will probably find it more exciting that teenagers since there are less adrenaline pumping rides available. This is my second visit and for those with even younger children (below 4), there are even fewer things for them to do so I would recommend you wait till they are 5 at least. 100 to 107cm is the minimum height for most rides.Food is limited to burgers, hotdogs and fried chicken so if you want something else, you have to bring it in yourself. We got the 2 day pass which allows unlimited entries on two consecutive days for both the main park and water park. The water park is much smaller than Sunway Lagoon (obviously) but it is a good way to spend the afternoons.The tropical Malaysian heat (or rain) is not park friendly so do pack a raincoat or umbrella on your visit - or you can buy a couple of over-priced souvenir Lego umbrellas! Hats and sunblock are a must. There are a couple of indoor attractions and rides which are suitable to cool off as well.If you'd like more rides and less wait, I would recommend visiting during the weekdays, I noticed the crowd dropped off after Monday so Tuesday to Thursday would probably be the quietest.",5.0
1735,Lego lego,We came from Singapore in going to Legoland. It seems so hassle when you are crossing from one border to the other and one immigration to the other. When we arrive the weather is hot. We left Singapore at 9:15am delayed by 15mins due to traffic the bus did not make it on time. From Singapore flyer going to Johor Bahru we arrived at 11:45am we ate first at the Cafe. Then we start to hop from one attraction and ride to the other. But we slow down because of the hot weather we always look a place to cool down. Going back to Singapore we left Johor Bahru at 5:45pm and arrived Singapore at 8:45pm. The line going to immigration is really heavy. To sum it all up charge everything to experience. The most important is my 5 year old and 9 year old enjoyed the experience and they have fun. Including the shopping spree of Legos. ,4.0
1736,More suitable for kids but the theme makes it enjoyable for adults,"Awesome lego theme is consistent throughout the park with an wide array of exclusive and customisable merchandise which are exclusive. Little shelter so slather yourself in sunblock and expect lots of walking. Food is pricey and isn't that great so I will recommend that you bring your own snacks for breaks. Walking around the park in an anti clockwise direction is ideal. If you're with kids, the bulk of the kiddy attractions are in the middle at the end of the park. Queuing times are short and lockers are based on a one-time charge with unlimited re-opening options.",5.0
1737,Awesome as usual,"We take an annual trip to Legoland. This year only the youngest of our 5 kids came with. Typically its the six of us (mom, dad and 4 younger kids).This year due to a combination of conflicting schedules and the fact that the older kids didn't want to follow, just the three of us.I guess the only complaint would be not enough attractions for older kids and adults.Legoland should keep track of loyal families (like us!) and provide some loyalty treats üòÉü§ò",4.0
1738,"Fun, fun, fun",Stayed here recently for a treat for kids.  Brilliant welcome & impressive building.  If it can be lego it will be built with lego!! Hotel very clean & caters well entertaining kids.  ( & adults-  lego addictive!) Great theme park rides & water park.  Staff uber friendly only down side is not the best eating experience for vegetarians.  Thank goodness for di mattoni in the foyer.  Kids got late night desserts from the bar thanks to lovely staff.

Not everything was functional when we visited, though.  I had read that there isn't much shade, and it's true, so prepare accordingly if you're going to be there on a sunny day.  Food was not expensive.  It was overall a great day.  Going on a weekday was great because there weren't many people and we never really had to wait for any of the rides.",4.0
1741,3 years on and they are still refreshing themselves,"As an annual pass holder for the past 3 years, I've been here countless times and the kids love it. The best part is that they constantly add new exhibits or rides or attractions so you aren't restricted to the tried and tested. I must say this is a big thumbs up from other attractions I've been to (Disneyland, universal studios) around the world where the attractions are static and they don't add anything new over the years.",4.0
1742,Great couple of days at Legoland,The kids loved our holiday here. The staff are very friendly especially to the kids. We bought an annual pass as they were on sale and was cheaper then buying tickets for three days. We visited 2 years ago and everything is looking slightly more run down and in need of renovation. A few little things around the park such as the water cannons didn't work however the kids still had a great time. They really like the waterpark and floating around the river. There was a fantastic staff member there who entertained them by building rafts out of Lego and pushing them around in it. Not sure how good the quality will be in a few years as paint is peeling and concrete cracking however the kids loved it and they don't notice that stuff. Would go back again as it was so entertaining and good value. ,5.0
1743,Not many attractions open,"Many of the attractions are closed for renovation , most of the rides are for kids of the age 4 and above , food for vegeterians are very limited to only one restaurant in the entire park . the pool side ( water Park ) is fun to spend time in the wave pool If you have kids who are teenagers then its not the right place to visit.",3.0

The park has plenty of cafes with a variety of food options including vegetarians. If it's raining suggest to cover the Waterpark first since some of the Theme park rides are closed when raining, and then go to Theme park after the rains have stopped.All-in-all a fun place to visit and keep the engaged engaged in good old activities and away from the ""screens"".",5.0

The pool on level 5 was clean and has 2 pool attendants to look after us all the time. We had nice breakfast in ""Bricks family Restaurant"" with loads of breakfast spread. So well done guys and we sure will come back for our next stay perhaps a little bit longer.

1751,The Water Park is just a by product; The Legoland theme park is the main,"The Water Park is not impressive and not worth a visit if you only visit the water park. It is only worth as a by product of overall the Legoland theme park. It is no worth your money just visiting the water park if do not live in neighborhood. Many other water parks are much better than this Legoland water park.The legoland theme park itself is good and worth a visit. The day is usually and always humid, and it is hot, so prepare yourself with good sun block to avoid sun burning. Beyond that, the rides and lego structures are worth the money to visit.I gave an average because the water theme park brought down otherwise a worth a visit the Legoland theme park in Johor Baru.",3.0

1757,"Average, but way too expensive","I've been here with my wife and my 1.5 year old son.Overall, i dont think this park is suitable for us and those who got infant (less than 3 years old), since almost all rides or activities are not for them.. they cant get on those rides, even with guardian or parents.Even so, i believe the price is way too expensive. They have rides, but not very adventerous one, only for kids. Not only the enterance fee, the price of the food and the souvenirs sold inside there were ridiculous. This is an open air park, so get ready with the very hot climate and bring some water to drink.To be honest, i prefer the indoor theme park at Puteri Harbour, more comfortable, my son can enjoy almost all rides, and much cheaper than legoland.",2.0
1758,Small park but fun,"It's small and many facilities are just for kids. there're only very few people so queue was always less than 15 minutes. the lego displays are generally very colourful but looking old now.

Whether you are a child, young adult or young at heart, the place will appeal to the child in you. Apart from the various exciting rides, there are also plenty to do and see. Star Wars fans will love the special section with all the Star Wars miniature displays. My favorite in the theme park is the Miniland where a myriad ASEAN countries in miniatures were displayed, which made for great photo moments. Even if you don't grow up with Legos, Legoland is definitely a happy place where all childhood dreams come true! ",4.0

1767,Awesome Holiday For kids And Parents,"We stayed at Legoland Resort for 2 nights. The days spent with toddler and teenager were fabulous. Hotel LobbyIt is full of LEGO bricks for kids to play while waiting for our turn to check in. In fact the check- in procedure was quick. Impressive!The LiftsIt was surprise to see disco lights accompanied with disco music the moment we enter the lifts. The lifts too,decorated with LEGO wall paper. The RoomIt was fully carpeted with theme.Mine was Adventure Theme and my toddler was very busy counting and exploring those creatures around. He even hugged and kissed the monkey at the chest box!Most hotels are not able to maintain the cleanliness of rooms with carpet after a few years old but Legoland Hotel did a great job maintaining it otherwise we will be sneezing throughout the stay. Well done! And all of us slept well.The BathroomThere are 2 wash basins. One made to child's level. Awesome!Just would like to comment about the shower head of the bathroom that we stayed was kind of big and heavy that could fall and hit my toddler's head if not firmly held up. Please improve this!The Brick RestaurantThere was variety of choices for food for breakfast and dinner. My toddler was unusually able to sit more than 15 min to complete his meal. It was because the staff provide him some crayons and table size paper for him to draw,scribble and colour. And we could sit comfortable to enjoy our meal. I would said the arrangement was  thoughtful about family with kids.AccessibilityIt was just mere less than 10 minutes walk to both water and theme. parks.StaffsVery polite,warm and efficient. Keep it up! It is what most customers looking for to be greeted warmly.The ExperienceOverall my kids were happy and enjoyed staying at the Legoland Hotel as well as having fun at the water park.As parents we feel the money was well spent and we will visit again.",5.0
1768,Go midweek!!,"We had a two day pass at Legoland and it was so much fun!! Kids are 6 and 7 and could go on all but one ride. It was very uncrowded and this made our time better as we did not have to line up for rides and attractions. The two day pass meant we could start at the waterpark on day one, then start Legoland that afternoon and then return to tthe main theme park the next day. I would recommend a MINIMUM of two days to see this attraction. Well worth it!!",5.0
1769,LEGOLAND - Funland,"Been to Legoland twice. The first was back in 2014 when we decided to buy a COMBO tickets online which is much cheaper. Legoland hosts two theme parks, the waterpark and the playground. On the first trip, we ended up spending the entire day at the waterpark as we have to entertain our small children (they enjoyed the waterpark so much that they refused to leave early). By the time we left the waterpark at 5pm, there was barely just two hours to spend on the Playground.A solution to this is either you purchase a separate ticket or you stay at one of the magnificently theme Legoland family room hotel. You have a direct and of course free entry to the waterpark and the playground right at your doorstep.Legoland, as the name implies comprise of a LEGO theme waterpark and playground made mostly but not entirely from the LEGO based bricks and pieces. It is so nicely presented and very enjoyable to visit.Located more than 20km from the Central part of Johor Bahru, it is more convenient to book a ""chartered"" transportation. And my advice is, if you stay at the KSL Resorts, you can buy your package (Legoland tickets + transportation) at the tour reservation desk.And again, a day spent at the LEGOLAND Playground is not sufficient to enjoy the entire available games.On the Minus side:Buying ticket at the Legoland booth is a cumbersome experience, with the hot day and long queue, the torture becomes worse when some of the customers are allowed to jump the queue.  Solution to this is, again buy ONLINE ticket and print it for easy access.",5.0
1770,Great for 4 - 11 year olds and dads,"Fun and full on. There's not much they haven't thought of at this hotel and their parks. The staff at the hotel are lovely and attentive. The lego in the room safe is great, however the clues are a bit vague. Breakfast is not for the faint hearted. There isn't enough western, healthy food sadly we found. They need more cereal, fruit, muffins, juice selection. Be careful you need to book ahead for the onsite Italian restaurant. Split bills take them some time to get right. The buses drop you off at the tradesman entrance to Legoland, which about a 500 metre walk and a bit rough after travelling there via bus from Singapore.The waterpark is small, but fun. The food is the best there out if all the food across the hotel and parks we found. And their kiosk staff were lovely! Funny and chattey. The floating bricks are great. Some lifeguards were engaging and had fun with kids. Others were far too officious and put a downer on the time spent there. The amusement park was good, food a bit expensive and disappointing. Again needs healthier foods to choose from and more western selections. The height restrictions were too high for their rides and inconsistently applied. Age and ability needs to be taken into consideration. The Lego car making is fun, go their for the competition times. 4 D is great too.  It was a great holiday, not cheap, but lots of great memories were made during our time. ",4.0
1771,Fun for kids,Games are suitable for kids and teenagers. Fun games and kids will enjoy. Lots of things to do. Great for family.,5.0
1772,Don't go on bus tour from Singapore,"The park was great and a lot of fun, especially for our children (4 and 6 years old). Quite a few of the attractions are only available from age 6 and up, though. They wouldn't let our son on those rides even when he was tall enough to satisfy the height requirements.The big drawback was that we took a bus tour from Singapore (via WTS Travel). We spent more time on the bus and at the border than at the park. When leaving Singapore we had to wait almost 2 hours at the passport control. We left our hotel at 8 am and only got to Legoland by 12:30 or so.If you find other travel arrangements or are visiting from Malaysia, then I can recomment this, but do not go on a bus tour from Singapore.",2.0

1774,Childhood Re-visited,"This is an amazing theme park featuring lego creations and a must-visit when you are near Singapore-Malaysia as this does not require you to stay in Malaysia. It's nearer to SG than in the heart of Malaysia, maybe an 1 1/2 of travel including immigration pass. As amazing as it is, I think it's lacking with the thrilling rides especially when you have experienced rides in California. It might be too hot in the mid-afternoon so it's better to visit the place early morning.",5.0

1778,The wonderful water park with rides too.,"Legoland is a wonderful place to go in Johor Baru.When you first enter, they will greet you with a little performance to welcome you to the park. There are lots of wonderful things to do like going to the big bucket fall and the big donuts. Not only that, you could even write a comment about their food, staff and cleanliness. When you want to change between the theme park and the water park, you need to have a combo ticket. If  your children are underage, they would recommend you not to go on the rides with your children. If your children get hurt, there is a medical clinic. It is the best place to go to because Johor Baru is a hot city and it is good to go the water park to cool off. They also have a locker system which will auto lock after you rent the locker to safeguard your handphones, wallet and your bags too.",5.0

1781,An improvement,"Second time to Legoland and some noticeable improvements (last time was three years ago).Best improvement, it's so much shadier! Trees have grown so visitors are no longer exposed to the harsh sun. Am also glad that they have continued to add new stuff. They had an awesome Lego gallery which recreated the war scenes of each Star Wars episode (1 to 6). Absolutely spectacular. Come Nov 16, they will be opening a new section dedicated to a 4D Ninjago experience. Too bad I missed that.It's not very crowded, which is good for visitors. The water theme park next door seems more crowded - maybe because it's newer.All in all, good fun. Rides cater to all ages. Park's a little small. You should be finished in 2/3 of a day, then you can revisit the rides you enjoyed more. ",4.0

Food is decent & there is lots of lego-related shopping options.",5.0
1783,We have gone there more than 7 times,"So it helps if u live in Sg n it's a 30-45 min drive if there is no traffic or jam at the causeway ( from door to door). If you have preschool kids , they will love it. I would recommend minimum age 4y to get on most rides. We have never queued more than 5 min for any ride and this includes weekends. Sometimes you have the entire ride to yourself...well almost. It is a great side trip from Sg if you are holidaying. It's great fun for the kids to stay at the legoland hotel for 1 -2 nights and go to both the theme park n the water park. There are direct coaches that bring you from centre of Sg to Legoland direct. While the prices are steep by Msian standards, with the current exchange rate, it's actually reasonable. Food: just avoid the Italian food in Legoland itself. Was bad. The rest, surprisingly decent like the Assam laksa. Otherwise, if you have an annual pass or are staying at the hotel, you can go to the adjoining Medina Mall for other food choices. All over priced by Msian standards but ok if u convert. The downside: the heat n humidity. Be prepared. Hats, sunblock, umbrellas, minimal clothes, ...you can cool down at the restaurants, the 4D cinema, the stage show. etc where there is air conditioning! Best part: Been to so many theme parks around the world. .... This one has no crazy queues for rides. Easy access from Sg. Tip: best to go early and arrive early at opening. Also know when the causeway gets busy. Avoid the eves of public holidays etc. ask a local about this ",5.0
1784,Good for small kids,I think the place is good for an age range of 5-7 years old. When we visit it was very quite.. almost no que at the attractions.. we can even enjoy the same attraction 2-3 times repetitively. There is no need for an express pass here.. anyways they do not have it indeed. Compared to universal studios of sentosa; it is very basic. Actually not correct to compare since they are extremely different..,4.0
1785,Great fun all round,Great fun for the young & young at heart. Midweek visit was perfectly timed with virtually no queues. Bit of a stretch to fit in waterpark on the same day but we did. Legoland not for teenagers but they may like the waterpark. ,5.0

1790,Great day out for kids,A lot has improved since the park opened in 2011.

1793,Second time and will still come back!,"Second time to Legoland, experience and feelings are the same- Awesome!We booked tickets for 17th Sep in advance. But my kid got very high fever making us unable to travel next day. I called the customer care. Emailed them. Every call was politely answered and proper guidance was given. Emails were ack and timely responded. They rescheduled our visit two weeks later, as requested. Sincerely appreciate the guys sitting in back office! Kudos!As for the theme park itself. Lively, colourful. Enjoyed clicking all around. Did rides, built and raced Lego car with my kid. Ate amazing food at the Pizzaria- Pizza, Pasta, lasagne, fruit salad, cokes, soups!Dragon ride is good. Decorated cup cakes, enjoyed The Kingdom.Did the ride that flash in water, wettest of all, 3 times, so much fun. My kid rode car, we rode boat together. Did lot of shopping at The Big Shop.It is a must for kids 1.5 yrs and above to any age. If you are planning to visit both theme and water park, and if this is your first visit- make sense to devote 2 days rather than one. Cards are accepted inside the park for food, shopping etc so no need to worry much!Next time, again, for sure!",5.0

1795,Great for young kids despite hot weather,"We were here on Sunday (considered as working day in Johor), there was no crowd. There is no need to queue and we almost get 2 times for each ride in the park. Very much fun for the kids. Kids have to be at least 110cm to qualify for most of the rides and games. Weather is very sunny, well nothing new to Malaysian. There is slightly lesser rides in this legoland compared to the one in California however it's still fun for the kids. ",4.0

1797,My kids' favourite hotel,We have been to this hotel several times .  It seem pricy but the following reasons bring us back again:-1) each room can accommodate up to 5 pax comfortably2) breakfast buffet is covered for 43) it's do near to legoland theme parks4) the hotel is packed with lots of lego fun5) our kids constant nagging  etc .. I will recommend this hotel for family with young kids and want a luxury yet affordable short stay . No time will be wasted and the kids will have a lot of fun activities to keep them occupied.The hotel staff are very helpful and friendly. The room is very well maintained.  We have an enjoyable and comfortable stay there.,5.0

1800,Lego land them Park,Lego land was interesting and had a lot of rides this is a good family location. It was interesting and exiting I recommend going here for family fun.,3.0
1801,Family holiday ,We visited with four children ranging from 7 to 13.The rides are more suited to younger children or children who are not thrill seekers.Still suitable to 12 and even 13 year old especially if they are Lego fans.They have places were you can build with Lego and rides which are fun.The park was clean and staff friendly and helpful.There are some rides where you get wet and they are a lot of fun for all ages.,4.0
1802,Unique! Fun and very very hot.,We came as a cousins outing with 15 people.  8 children 5 teenagers.  The rides are mostly non-thrill but is fun even for adult.  Different cities built in Lego were quite the sight to see!  It's really hot here so don't forget sunscreen and a cap.  ,4.0
1803,Great day out ,We had a fantastic day out at Legoland . It was difficult to get to from Singapore but we caught a MY taxi from Queen St Singapore for $70 and it was an enjoyable ride. ,5.0
1804,Surprisingly short queues,"The rides are not as breathtaking as Universal Studios or Movie World but it is still a worthwhile and fun experience. Great for spending quality time especially if you have young children in the family. Despite it being a Sunday, the queues are like pretty short.",4.0
1805,Legoland Restaurant,"The restaurant as LEGOLAND has room to improve. Type of meal, the quantity of the meal and especially the friendliness of the restaurant staff were bad. In most case, the cashiers were rude when explaining the available meal from the screen. Not friendly at all. Training for the cashier is a must to change their attitude. LEGOLAND is family/kids place. No room for rudeness!",5.0
1806,Wow,"Wow, wow, wow! Go, go, go!!!This is a must visit destination if you have young children who love Lego! How beautifully detailed and fun. They have really gone the extra mile to provide the all round family experience. The staff are so friendly and amazing. From the mini bath robes and slippers in the room to the child size vanities in the bathroom, this hotel really knows what the kids and parents want. I would recommend a stay here to anyone who just loves Lego. Loved it so much, we would go again, even without kids. ",5.0
1807,Nice theme park for kids with no really extreme rides.,"Desperately needs more shade and some healthier options for food. However, our kids just loved this place and the joy they experienced made it worth every cent. Staff are excellent and friendly. While it isn't cheap it was not as expensive as I was expecting.",4.0
1808,Good for younger kids,"This park is lots of fun for younger kids (but may not have enough exciting rides for older kids). Particular favourites of were driving Lego cars, driving boats and 'Rescue Academy' where the kids drive a fire truck and pretend to put out a fire. The 'build and test' area was great when the park got too hot (as it is air conditioned). The Ninjago puppet show was amazing. The downside of the park is that it is very hot and doesn't have much shade. We also found that the Lego is the shops was 10-20% more expensive than in Australia,",3.0
1809,"Great park, poor Halloween performance","This is our third time visiting Legoland. The park was fantastic and interacting with the characters was great fun, so much to do and see. The rides were fun, and there was a great variety for everyone. Meals were good, and fairly priced. Coincidentally Legoland is having a Halloween Brick or Treat event. Bravo to the parade performers as I enjoyed watching them in dancing in Thriller theme in a group. So cool. Lots of treats were given as well.The only drawback to the entire visit was the Halloween story tellers at Miniland and the some kind of Monster Catching show. The stories are too dull and the story tellers are not even in their Halloween costume to suits the Halloween event. Presenting the story at a really annoying tune.The show at the Castle also was too bored, the whole show was only talking nonstop and less actions and excitement. Same goes to the performers there not even in its proper Halloween costumes. Even my kids are commenting that the previous shows in Legoland are way better than this one.",3.0
1810,Construction ongoing and changing room/showers not up to par ,"Was there on October 1st and 2nd. Kids love the Brick or Treat thing and the theme park currently undergoing some renovation. Otherwise still an attractive theme park in Johor. Went to the water park the next day. Bummer that our favorite rides the Red Rush was closed. Weather was scorchingly hot and places under a shade was at at premium. My daughter was unlucky recipient of a wayward throw of a build a raft brick by a life guard!The male shower/changing room facilities are in need of a reality check. Some stalls are missing locks, faucets and some (I used one) suffer from low water pressure.Will I renew my annual pass? ü§î",3.0
1811,Typical fun for kids,"When I was a kid, I loved playing Lego. Now I am adult, I am not as huge fan as I was before. The place is interesting and surely the kids will enjoy their day playing and seeing Lego buildings. Even the hotel looks like it was built with Lego bricks and the rooms are themed as well. I did not fully enjoy the visit because we're in a hurry going to Melaka. If I'd have a chance again, I'll explore more and we'll see if it'll be a more enjoyable one. By the way, there's also bus services going to and from the place. It is an ideally 20-30 min ride from JBCC.",3.0
1812,Great Park for Kids,"My 5yo daughter absolutely loves Legoland Malaysia. They have two parks, the amusement park and the waterpark side by side, its probably best to visit them in different days, so that you will be able to experience the whole park without time limitation (it closes at around 7).The amusement park itself its moderate size, just enough for a relaxing 6 hour stroll. Most of the rides are suitable for little children. Bring extra clothes, you might either get wet on a ride, or get wet when it rains. Lots of activities and fun corners to take pictures. The food inside are also quite nice, big portions. Plenty of sitting areas for people not going on rides. And dont forget to visit the lego store before you go home.The second day we visited the waterpark, its nice and big, with lots of different pools and slides. unfortunately we had thunderstorms on the day we visited and the life guards asked us to wait until the sky clears up.overall great trip, will be visiting again (on behalf of my kids request) soon.",5.0
1813,Pretty cool,"Was the only reason we came to JohorWas pretty cool the thought that was put into creating a park around Lego, from the train that takes you around the park to the rides and the displays were amazing.The service was slow from lining up for the tickets (only 3booths open out of about 8) to waiting over 20mins for a chicken wrap and chips (which weren't even hot chips were Pringles from a packet - had to laugh!)A must see if you are in Johor or nearby  ",4.0
1814,Great Resort for kids,"The Theme Park is great for any lego lover. The driving school, live show, lego city, just amazing. Need at least a whole day for the theme park. And then there is the water park... WOW...",5.0
1815,fantastic time!,"Travelling to Legoland with my son was wonderful. We took the 2 days package and spent the 1st day covering 1/3 of the dry park and the wet park. 2nd day was well spent at the dry park only and we managed to cover everything! As a tip...please get the 2days ticket if you intend to cover the park and start early in the morning at 10 or 11am. My son is at the age and appropriate height where he is able to access all rides so it was really enjoyable for him and literally forced me to go on the roller coaster for 10times within the 2-days duration we were there. Must must try the roller coaster at Technics and Dragon! Based on my personal opinion, i honestly think that kids at the age of 6yrs old and above would really appreciate Legoland and will be able to play all the rides. There are still attraction for the younger kids nonetheless but somewhat more limited. The eateries at Legoland are good and while they dont come cheap, nasi lemak set at RM20 and burger set at RM25, the portion is huge! so you can certainly share it.Another tip, if you have extra cash to spend - stay at the Lego hotel. The lobby and rooms are wonderful. It doesnt come cheap but at the end of the long day...you would be too tired to drive or catch a taxi to go back to another hotel. So, do consider Lego hotel as an option. I didnt stay at Lego hotel..and opted to stay at Puteri Harbour instead which is just 10mins away... but trust me after a long day at the park, you are just to tired to even catch a cab. All in all...fantastic trip to Legoland and would definitely go back. Yes, the weather is hot but you will survive it for the kids! ",5.0
1816,Water park,"Spend 5 amazing hours at the water park. Love the slides, never knew that it would be so fun playing slides of various sizes (various types of floats:single, double, family, sliding mat etc). There are various difficulties of slides that caters to adults and kids. There are waves pool, children pool etc. Life jackets are plenty, life guards are visible at each station. Resting chairs available for those who do not swim. The failities are superb. Keep it up!!!",4.0
1817,Improvement needed,My earlier review on Legoland Resort was meant for the Theme Park. The hotel cant be called a resort without the theme park!,3.0
1818,Excellent place for kids,"Location  easy to locate it, with lots of signboard to navigate.Lots of car park available.The theme park lots of activities for young kids, my kids really enjoy it. But for adult its bit boring, other than the roller coster .. not much activities to enjoy.Water parkIts really great place for young kids, we spend most of our day trip here. kids dont want to stop playing inside water park. Lots of slide available, but the best was ""slide racer"" & ""splash n swirl"". Visiting timeIt was school holiday when we visit legoland & its bit crowded. If you want to avoid long que, avoid visiting on school holiday. to get the tube for ""splash & swirl"" took us almost an hour, they have only 5-6 tube available.  Try to visit this park for 2 days ( water & theme park ), 1 day visit really rush you to enjoy all.Recommendation  This park really suitable for young kids & teens, but for adult that looking for extreme rides ... its totally will make your day worst.",4.0
1819,Failed to get the fun,"This theme park basicaly is as same as other theme park, the differences is only lego. The theme park itself is costly but eventualy it is below our expectations, though its big but nothing special, just a lego. We might not return here anymore",3.0
1820,A place that requires a careful planning! ,"One day is too short to fully explore & enjoy Legoland Malaysia! The area is extensive & offers a lot of attractions & activities, each, I think are worth experiencing. Thespread of numerous Lego builds were quite impressive. We especially liked the Einstein face & the many miniature structures. The place has a number of Lego shops, some of which sell items you can't get outside of Legoland. To avoid disappointments, carefully plan your trip to Legoland Malaysia. The place is located far from town so if you have a few days worth of tickets, you have to consider the transport cost to & from, if you are staying in town. Legoland Resort is an option but it is not cheap to stay there. Try not to schedule your trip during school holidays or long weekend holidays because the place will be packed & you would not want to spend much of your time queuing to get into the fun rides, join activities or see the shows or exhibits. The weather is also important to consider in the planning. Much of the nice things to see are outdoor so make sure you visit Legoland Malaysia on good (not too hot) sunny days. The place requires a lot of walking & that too walking under the sun so check with the people you are planning to go with if they can & are fine with it.",3.0
1821,Everything is awwwwsooome!,"There's Lego everywhere.. well obviously, that's why this happy place is named Legoland üòÉif you have young kid(s) who's into lego (with a lego fan dad) then this is a need-must place to visit.. All of the attraction is designed to keep the young lego fan (and the older one) entertained.. Each of the attraction has height and age limit, mostly 110-120cm or min 6yo. But no worries, if your young ones does not meet the requirement, they can get into the attraction with your companion..My 6yo most favorite ride was the Project X at Lego Technic and The Dragon at the Kingdom. Both are roller coaster, designed with a touch of lego along the action. He rode 5 times each.. Yes.. 5 times!! We were so lucky that we visited the park on Monday/Tuesday in low season.. It feels like we were playing in our own backyard coz there were barely no queue, so we can take the ride back and forth at no time..We took the 2-day combo pass, we paid full at 1-day combo price and we get 2nd day for free as we stayed at the Legoland hotelWe spent one and a half day in the theme park and the other half day in the waterparkWe came there as a pack of four. Three of us plus my 22yo sister.. My sister and I are not a huge lego fan, but we are still amazed with every details of the park that are soo amazingly cute and cool, which of course made out of lego..we can't stop taking picture ;pIt was all worth spend..All in all, as Emmet's favorite jam, Everything is awesooooome :)",5.0
1822,Memorable Visit,"Looks out for credit card or other promotions available beforehand to get a discount on tickets.Ample of parking space.We didnt stay at Legoland hotel, there are other budget hotels around.Rides are more suited for kids below 12.So far looks well maintained.Good selection for meals, a little expensive obviously.The Star Wars lego models are a big hit.There is a lack of shade or covered walkways to deal with the heat or rain.",4.0

1825,Waterpark saved our day,"Upon a recommendation, we chose Legoland tour on our 5 day holiday in Singapore. Singapore Flyer did their job well in picking us up and transporting an almost full coach to JB. Legoland is a friendly theme park and staff were helpful in upgrading us from theme park only to the combo for a nominal fee, allowing us entry into the water park also. It is clearly a place for young children or serious Lego enthusiasts. We were neither and after a couple of roller coaster rides and the well displayed Star Wars presentation, we moved into the Water park. Thank goodness for this otherwise, would have been a very long wait for the return bus.No, it's not on the same scale as water parks on the Gold Coast, but we had fun and enough rides to see out the day. It was great to see so many happy people having a fun day. For many, it seemed to be their first time to any type of water park making it very special. NB Remember to wear modest swimwear as majority of women and even men are mostly covered.There's a fantastic choice of food eateries just outside the two parks which is far superior and exceptionally well priced compared to Gold Coast and even Orlando parks. We loved the Thai restaurant. The only disappointment, was I must mention, Singapore border security was extra slow in processing non residents in both departure and returning where we queued 30 mins and 55 mins for processing. That time is allowed for in this full day tour, but put a dampener on the day.Go to Legoland if have young kids, combine the visit with the Waterpark as there's enough time to do both.",3.0
1826,Great family experience,"If you planned to visit Legoland, you need one whole day to spend time here. The best day to visit is on Friday as it closed at 9pm. Water park first, theme park later. Visited almost 80% of the park but fully satisfied for a first time visit. Lifeguards everywhere. Satisfied with the facilities standards. Foods buy in combo. DImprovementHopefully the management can add some more shady tents at the open swimming area. Had to move kids to the kids pool which is located at another area. ",5.0

1828,Lego lovers dream!,"If I were to compare this park to others I have been to in Australia ( MovieWorld, Dreamworld, SeaWorld), I would say that facilities wise and standards wise it is somewhat lacking. Where it makes up for this is sheer novelty and scale of Lego themed EVERYTHING!!  Our family ( 2 adults and kids age 8 and 10), loved every minute of visiting both parks. We also loved the variety of shopping for well priced Lego ( especially items unseen by us in Australia). The staff are friendly and enthusiastic, the only pitfall can sometimes be English that is a little hard to decipher. Overall great value and a most enjoyable family adventure!",4.0
1829,Nothing really new.,"There's nothing new about this place. Sure, it's Lego-themed and you can get some nice merchandise (including bricks), but the roller-coasters here aren't really my kind of thrill.

There are other small shops and restaurants nearby but you must do the buffet at Bricks Restaurant, the food was great but the desserts were fantastic, they even have a decorate your own cake station for the kids. Wifi is good. A magical experience for our family (2 kids 6 & 8). Staff are all really friendly.",5.0
1839,Can skip visiting if you're not a lego fan,"Legoland Malaysia is extremely hot. The sun bounces off the concrete and there were not much trees to cover the pathways.

Its a specialised theme park with lots of lego figurines everywhere, exhitibition and replicas of famous buildings around the world. So yes, different is good and entertaining.On the other hand, if you were to compare this with other normal theme parks, this is not for thrill seekers. They have very little rides (though most of them were great), it is more kids appropriate or if you like taking lots of pictures. The surrounding area is not that great with very little facilities. Getting here was easy by public or by personal transport.",4.0
1853,Every kids dream day out - but Singapore Border Crossing now a nightmare,"A day trip to LEGOLAND from Singapore used to be quite simple, however, with increased border security and the introduction of fingerprinting for everyone, this is now something you really need to consider. Taking the bus from Singapore Flyer at 9am in the morning, we had to wait 1 hour at Singapore customs and only 5 minutes at the Malaysian side. On the return trip it was a nightmare as we waited 2 hours and 40 minutes in customs at the Singapore side after again only 5 minutes in Malaysia where incidentally they also fingerprint travellers but not kids.That is the logistics side of things but when you arrive at LEGOLAND it is fabulous and going mid-week you can almost stay on many of the rides or at worse have a limited queuing time. Lot's for all the family to do and many rides as well as sights to take in. We combined the theme park with the water park although spent only an hour at the water park due to kids wanting to stay more at the theme park but definitely worth combining. Water slides are great fun and not too long queues either.I would like to call out the ladies at the Water log flume who came over and took the kids aside to show them how to build lego T-Rex's which gave us time to enjoy a 10 minute break over lunch. All in all a great day out though I have to say that Malaysian food is not the best. One last watch out is if you go to the convenience shop in the strip leading up to LEGOLAND and do not have Malaysian Ringit and want to use Singapore Dollar you will most certainly get a crap exchange rate so make sure you either withdraw Ringit from the cash machine or have Ringit available.",4.0
1854,A great places for young kids,"We went here with a group of friends and were the only couple without kids. We still had a great time. The rides are a little tame for adults so if you go here without kids don't be expecting an adenaline packed time. The water park was busier and was also really good. All facilities were clean and well maintained, all with friendly staff. If you know Malaysia, all of these things are rare! ",5.0
1855,Average ,Legoland is just an average place IMHO. Went there on a Sunday during SG school holiday but it wasn't that crowded. The only ride that needs to wait 30 mins is the big roller coaster ride. Others rides the waiting time is average 15 mins. We completed in 3 hours. Took some rides and walked around. I would not say it is very big as I still prefer Singapore USS. ,3.0

1858,Bring your sunnies and hats!,"We were lucky no queues on most of the rides even though it was a long weekend in Singapore and Malaysia.The rides are suitable for kids below 10. Food at reasonably priced, with Set meals costing additional MYR5, yeah, get the set meals.Not many place to shelter yourself when it's rain or too hot. Bring an umbrella, hats and sunscreen!Love their waterparks as well. Rides are suitable for young children, min height 102/107cm. ",4.0
1859,A kids paradise,"Well.. it's Legoland, every kids dream (and most adults too). Great experience, good rides and activities both in water and land areas. You will need 2 days to cover all, unless you have an express pass. Some rides will have long queues, especially during weekends and holidays. Please check the weather forecast before you make the visit. Most of the rides will not operate under rainy / overcast conditions.",4.0
1860,My daughter's favourite waterpark,My daughter likes to go to the waterpark every year on her birthday. Looking forward for more new rides for the Legoland themepark.,4.0
1861,Legoland,"The place is quite huge, so need to walk a lot. Most of the rides are outdoor. Legoland needs to consider having shaded/enclosed walking space for sunny days. Definitely need sunscreen & umbrella. They have a water park as well. Rides have age and height limitations. They have the Lego play table with the lego blocks at every shop to entertain the kids while we shop or eat. ",4.0
1862,"Nice stay at Legoland Hotel, Kingdom Theme","My family stayed at LEGOLAND hotel. My family enjoyed the stay. There are 3 decker beds, just nice for my 3 kids, parents room is just behind a sliding door. Kids room has TV and parents room has another TV. The TV programs have many kids channels like Disney Junior, Cartoon Network, Nickelodeon. There is a washing basin for kids, many Lego decorations, hidden toys. Amenities are in good condition like hair dryer, air-con, hot shower, safe, electric water kettle. My family will come back again to stay at Legoland Hotel. Keep up the good work. Thank you.",5.0
1863,Need more trees especially hot weather,Nice experice with children. Children love the Lego display & rides. Need more cooling shelters especially on hot days.Price seem to be catering for foreigners as price is steep for average wage malaysian. ,3.0
1864,Nice place,"As usual, Legoland is a very good place for children. I visited the one near San Diego, this one is bigger, newer and contains 2 parks : the Legoland and the water park. ",4.0
1865,Ok place to go but they need to have more rides for younger children,"The waterpark charges for all ages although the dry park charges for those above 3. However, there are both height AND age restrictions for a lot of the rides and even if your kids are old / tall enough, they may still not get on the ride if they don't meet the other condition. However you will see cases where the staff let such things slide if you talk to them like a ""friend"" but mind you, if anything happens it's at your own risk. But seriously some rides need not any height restriction but there still is. Similar rides in Disneyland have no such restriction but I guess that's because it's ..... Disneyland.There are not enough floats on the river ride and the Lego bricks there are old and dirty. The staff are complacent or just stand around doing their own stuff or were even playing with their phones when they were supposed to be working.There were even cases where patrons were smoking openly but I guess the staff didn't care enough to stop them.",3.0
1866,Legoland theme park and water park are awesome!,Love the colourful scenery of both parks! Kids and adults enjoy both parks' attractions and rides. Most of the foods sold at the parks that i've tasted were all delicious. ,4.0
1867,"Less theme, more park!","My 5yo had been wanting to go to this place after watching the promos on TV and hearing from his school friends. The park has a good variety of activities to keep the kids and young adults busy for a whole day or even two, depending on weather. There are some shaded areas but not many. Expect to do a lot of walking around in the park and keep yourself well hydrated and well fed. Water slides can be tiring but fun. It is better for kids to not try to cover both water slides and theme park in the same day to avoid getting exhausted. The only medical assistance besides first aid is available at nearby hospital but it mag not be very prompt. If you are not staying in LL hotel, make sure you have a taxi to pick and drop you from wherever you are staying. Food options are very limited for vegetarians. Decide on whether you actually want an annual pass or not after your first visit. Not everyone will want to visit many times through a year. Also, making a booking at LL hotel for annual pass holders is slightly less expensive. I will probably go once more in a few months time.",3.0

1869,Great theme park with a variety of activities!,"What struck us the moment we stepped in is the expanse of the place - it is quite big and it takes a while to walk through and do all the activities! It was our first time so we didn't quite plan and we ended up walking to and fro quite a bit...There is a good range of activities for the little ones (and I guess, grown-ups, though I didn't take any 'grown-up' rides) - my daughter is 5 years old, a little on the small side, but she managed to enjoy herself with a good variety of rides (such as the dragon roller coaster, which she made us go on 4 times!)... I also love that there are lovely playgrounds around the park so the children can just run around and enjoy slides and climbing about...The Build and Test area in Imagination Land was also a nice place to cool off and let the children test their vehicles - so simple yet endless fun for the kids!",4.0
1870,Best service I've ever received from a Malaysian hotel,"I've travelled pretty extensively in Malaysia and Legoland gave my family the best service we've ever enjoyed, hands down. The amazing decor in my Kingdom premium room made us get the camera out in a hurry. Every corner you turn, there's something awesome made out of Lego. Even if you don't visit the theme park and water park (and why wouldn't you?!), the resort itself offers ongoing Lego competitions, movie screenings and a giant playroom in the middle of the reception to keep both my son and us happily occupied for hours. But it's the warm and sincerely cheery service we received from everyone that will make us come back again (and again). The smiley chambermaid readily gave me extra toiletries when she heard we were planning to visit the water park after we check out of hotel. The waiter gave me a tip to tell reception that I'm booking my next stay for our wedding anniversary, so they will give me a little surprise in the room). The buffet breakfast spread was extensive and delicious. We also dined at their Italian restaurant -- reasonably priced (when you convert to Singapore dollars) and the hand-stretched pizzas were more than decent. You can choose 2 toppings for a half-and-half pizza.Everyone just seemed really happy to be working there. Best of all, most spoke passable or even good English (rare in Malaysian hotels) and seemed genuinely interested in giving us a good time. We're huge Lego collectors and had a great time taking Lego with several staff.There was one unpleasant surprise when I could hear some major washing (the area near the entrance of theme park) late at night, from my 3rd floor room. Loud enough to wake me up. I highlighted it to the reception only when I was checking out (we didn't want to make a fuss and change rooms so late). Front desk supervisor Sharull handled it beautifully, apologizing immediately for the experience. I told him it was fine as we had really enjoyed our stay and plan to come back regularly. We just wanted to share our feedback so they can remind their staff in future. To our surprise, he immediately asked if I have a date in mind, and he reserved their 'basic' room for me at 30% discount (their current Halloween promotion for Legoland annual pass holders ) and threw in a free upgrade to their premium room. He also promised to give us a room with a great view. I saved several hundred ringgit and best of all, I didn't even ask for it. Good service recovery will keep this guest coming back. Good job! Will update my review when I come back for Round 2.",5.0
1871,Great fun for kids and adults,"Visited on 7 Sep 2016 (Wed) and lucky to have a fine weather (not much sun). We played from 11am to 6pm. Not crowed despite being the 1-week school holidays.  My 6-year-old boy tried ALL the rides, except the Dragon.  My 10-year-old daughter is less adventurous but still did many rides (some repeated).  The food at the pizza place was not bad.  RM70 for a combo set that was enough for our family. Love the fact that all the staff we met were friendly and patient with kids.  Nice job for making visitors feel welcome and happy. 4D shows can be better though ... the seats did not move as expected, so should not say is 4D. Look forward to visit again next year when the Ninjago attraction is up.",5.0

1875,Great,"As 2 adults we loved it!! Very good of them to open the park a bit earlier! Never had to que for the rides as its not too busy! Definitely worth getting the combo ticket for the water park aswell, as you can leave the park for lunch and re enter as you please. Lego city stage show was the highlight, it was brilliant, make sure you leave time for it!! Easy to get the busy to and from johor bahru bus station.",5.0
1876,Its ok,"The park itself is ok, but there is very little under cover or indoor areas and in Malaysia, it is either hot or raining (or both). The lego displays are great and plenty of places for the kids to play and build lego things. We enjoyed the Star Wars exhibit and the water fountain play areas the most.The food is also very average, we prefer to eat at the restaurants in the small shopping centre outside the park.Legoland Hotel however is totally awesome and is a 10/10 in my books. Worth going just to stay there and the buffet dinner is the best in the world. You can enjoy the buffet even if you are not staying in the hotel, outsiders can also join the buffet dinner. So worth it if you love food and so highly recommended for kids and adults alike. So much entertainment for the kids and the food and service were world class.",3.0
1877,Legoland ,"We took a direct transfer with Singapore limo service costing approx$130++each way, no getting out of the car- fantastic with 3 kids in tow. Took one hour max. Left around 8 there by 9 spent the day having great time on all the rides. Legoland is Clean and tidy, the hotel is a great idea . Could of stayed the night in hind sight. Left around 4 no cue at immigration . Good fun for everyone ",5.0
1878,Worth the journey from Singapore,The journey too and from Singapore makes it a long day but once there it is worth the effort... with lots to do and see... and it seems there is more to come... affordable and fun.If I were to do it again I would fly to KL and do the tour from the Malaysia to avoid the Singapore passport control.,4.0
1879,Wow! Everything you'd imagine Legoland to be,"What a fantastic place! It's everything you'd expect a world class brand like Lego to deliver. We went to the theme park with our 2 and 4.5 year old. My son, a huge Lego fan was blown away. There were rides to suit all ages. The staff were friendly and helpful. From the clean toilets right up to little gifts at the restaurant we went too made things pleasant.In the Malaysian heat, walking Legoland can be quite a challenge. Sunblock and umbrellas are useful. Although we went on a public holiday, Legoland was big enough with so many rides and activities that queues for the things we wanted to experience were not a long wait. We hardly waited more than 5 minutes to get on a ride. What was absolutely fabulous was the Ninjago live show. A must-see. So try and get to the theatre on time. Do check the weather before choosing a day to go. Most of the rides are outdoors so if it's raining, there are not many shaded activities. We missed the 4D show because the fire alarm went off and the show was cancelled. Legoland is a well thought out theme park and definitely worth the visit.",4.0
1880,Fund place to bring kits,The park is not crowded even on weekends! It has many activities to keep the kids occupied and entertained. Everything was great except for the mini word. Looks old after being in the sun for so many years. Needs upgrading.There is a new ningago ride coming in November 2016. Looks fun!Worth a visit.,4.0
1881,Gd bonding & learning sessions at Mindstorm Workshops!,"This was our N times to LEGOLAND Malaysia and they are improving each time we were there! My kids used to enjoy the Mindstorm workshops on his own while parents are not allow to enter but during this recent trip, we were surprised that we were able to join our kids! The staff was well trained, friendly & knowledgeable. This gave us a chance to work as a team to solve all the tasks given. The bonding and learning sessions were so fun and the kids had learnt how to program the robots to move and complete the tasks.And I've to add on that the Creativity Day 2016 program is great! Kids and any adults get the chance to build something out of the LEGO bricks and add on to the collection for display in LEGOLAND. How nice!We will be back for more fun when the Ninjago ride is ready this November 2016!",4.0

1884,A childs' dream,"Our kid group consisted of 2 teenagers and a 10,7,6y/o. Older teenager was aching to leave by afternoon, while younger children were contently immersed in Lego wonderland.Most popular and long waiting ride was the driving school, which became repeatable once we had done the most attractive rides.I was Disappointed in the lack of water fountains and unchilled drinks. We had a person in our party unable to have iced drinks, so we had to hunt for unchilled beverages.We were glad to see the new attractions, without which the park would seem small, trivial and off the beaten track.Everything is......okay......",4.0
1885,Great value - park was so quiet ,"Booked this last minute when visiting family in JB. Got an offer on the website!Park was so quiet as it was a Wednesday and local schools weren't off.Therefore no waiting for rides, we literally could stay on the ride and keep going back to back!All 4 kids loved it (5, 7, 10 and 12) Food on the park was reasonable regards  prices and quality. Lots of booths trying to sell you photos from the rides.Definitely would recommend if you're in the area ",5.0
1886,"2 days combo ticket, not enough time!!","We bought the 2 days combo ticket during MATTA fair. It was a good bargain. We entered the park on the 1st day around 11am. Enjoyed the rides, building legos ,Miniland,etc. There were still a lot of rides that we did not manage to try. It was not peak season, so we get to enjoy the rides without waiting in line. My eldest son who is 6 years old enjoyed a lot of games and rides but his brother who is turning 2 next month was not able to ride in most of the available rides. But still, he enjoyed the playgrounds, boat ride, building legos, train ride, etc. There were lots of it. We didn't manage to finish all the rides although there were not many people around. On the second day, we went to the water park in the morning. Its quite small but still have lots of slides and stuff. We rushed to have lunch in the afternoon and went for the theme park to spend time until the park closes at 6pm. It was tiring but full of fun. The most important thing was, my parents who are mid 60s were still having fun in the park. Can't wait to return to the park!",4.0

1890,Great Merdeka visit ,"Went in early @ 930am as hotel guest. Had the park virtually to ourselves for almost the whole day. We were the only guests at most of the rides; so no queue and get to go multiple rounds on some of it.Not sure if it is such on most of the days or due to holiday.  It was a hot day, so the huts with fan, shops, restaurants and toilet with AC helps. Except for the heavy rain around mid afternoon that left us stranded at starwars, we enjoyed it.",4.0
1891,Perfect short vacation for the family!,"Our son just turned 5 years old and loves to play with Lego so we decided to visit Legoland for his 5th birthday celebration. So our family of four (also with our 5 month old daughter) flew to Singapore and then hired a private car to cross the border to Malaysia.We stayed at the Legoland Resort and got ourselves the 2-day combo tickets for the theme park and water park. We went to the theme park first on a Monday and line ups for rides and games were only around 5 mins, which was great. On our second day, we went to the water park in the morning and then headed back to the theme park in the late afternoon so my son could revisit some of the rides and games that he really enjoyed the previous day. This turned out to be the perfect arrangement.The rides and games in the theme park were perfect for his age, very fun and engaging. His height (110cm) also allowed him to go on the majority of the rides there. He enjoyed the entire theme park but particularly loved the Boating School and the Junior Driving School. One thing both my wife and I loved was that there were playgrounds and play areas that don't require line ups spread out across the theme park so people can be more spread out even on a very busy day. There is a big Lego shop near the entrance of the theme park but it doesn't carry all the different sets. However, the shops within the different themed areas inside the park do have a bigger selections of the particular themed sets (e.g. City, Kingdoms, etc.).The water park was also very nice with a large variety of water activities for all ages. Our 5 month old daughter was able to enjoy a small water playground for the little ones while our son kept going back and forth between a much bigger water playground and the lazy river right next to it.Food in the theme park was average (as is the case with most theme parks) but very reasonably priced. Food inside the water park (Brick Cafe) was very good and also reasonably priced.Overall, our entire family had a very memorable time at Legoland Malaysia and we do plan on going back again when our daughter is old enough to enjoy the rides and games.",5.0

Well laid-out park, with ample cafes and rest areas. Perhaps more shade or shady areas would have helped, given the sunny weather which is Malaysia.

Be honest, one day is not enough to complete all rides and attactions, if going to the park with kids, better give them at least 2 days and they will have an unforgetable holiday!",5.0
1897,More For Small Kids Than Teens Or Adults,"Totally agree with other reviewers that the park is more designed with kids of around six-year-old in mind. This said, Legoland is famous among all primary school students and it‚Äôs almost like a pilgrimage‚Äôs journey that they have to make (and they do ask for it!).The boys in our group, aged between 8-11, enjoyed some of the rides. They, and their daddies, were excited when they got to the Star Wars section. Overall, we spent around 6 hours in the park and it‚Äôs pretty enough. We didn‚Äôt do the Waterpark as we found the Adventure Cove Waterpark in Singapore more interesting. Yes, we took a day trip from Singapore and we‚Äôre so glad we did ‚Äì spared us all the hassles of moving hotels as there‚Äôre much more happenings in Singapore. It made more sense to use it as a base for travel. The immigration wasn‚Äôt so bad ‚Äì Took us less than 1.5 hours one way. We went on a Sunday and we‚Äôve arranged point-to-point pick-up. It‚Äôs more expensive than taking the public transportation but it‚Äôs really seamless ‚Äì we stayed in the same vehicle throughout the whole journey without having to get down to queue for immigration or change vehicle once past the Malaysian border. I‚Äôd recommend it if your budget is not so tight, especially if you have kids to care for.We used Limousine Transport ‚Äì they‚Äôre responsive, thorough and totally reliable. But later, the drivers told us that their fleets are actually independent operations sub-contracted by Limousine Transport. They gave us their name cards and asked us to call them directly next time if we need any transfer. It‚Äôd be much cheaper to book directly with them!

Lot of activity to plan and the good thing is the queue is not long like other park. There are many restaurant inside LEGOLAND and activity are constainly updated. We been to LEGOLAND in US and this one is bigger and less crowded. It also has a little water park (Pay separately) for the kids to enjoy which is good for country with hot weather.  You can hide master builder and 3D Movie if it rains.,4.0
1900,"Good theme park, even better water park - but too much lost time traveling","Legoland Malaysia is more for kids than adults. The rides are pretty tame so unless you're an adult lover of Lego (like me) or have kids I wouldn't recommend it. The Star Wars exhibit was great and the Mini-Land with all iconic buildings of Asia was really good (if hot as it's outdoors at the center of the park). The Lego water park was better with some good water slides. As a day trip from Singapore, we spent more than 5 hours travelling and going through passport control and customs. We spent 6 hours in Lego land and at the water park.If you're going to Legoland just once, stay 1 night at the Legoland Hotel. Be warned though - it's expensive.",3.0

It's a great park for young kids, but I think teenagers would get bored as there are no real thrill rides.  Still worth the visit.  We arrived at opening time and left when the park closed - definitely a whole day activity.  And we did not include the water park, although it looked really good.",4.0
1904,Compact theme park that is easy to get around with small children,"A great theme park for young children (12 years and below).  It was fairly quiet mid week with short lines.  The park is compact and easily covered in a day.  We stayed two days and did one half of the park on day 1 and then went to the water park in the afternoon to cool off.  Day 2 we took our time and watched the short movies in the theatre and did the other half of the park.  We ate at the pizza restaurant which had average food but better food than the hotel.  We travelled to Singapore at the end of day 2, waiting until 6pm to leave.   We were advised not to leave in the late afternoon as the border crossing gets really busy (we crossed at the second border close to LEGOLAND not at Woodlands and waited for about half an hour in line).  The line for the border crossing going the other way (Singapore into Malaysia) was crazy at 6pm.  If you are heading to LEGOLAND from Singapore I would recommend travelling no later than 4pm before the workers finish for the day.",4.0

1909,Nice Theme Park and Water Park,"Our second visit to legoland, but first time going to the water park. The weather was cloudy that day, which is really great for us. We started with water park in the morning and move on to the theme park after a late lunch.The water park area is not big, but they sure have lots of slides! We tried every single one of them, some even more than a couple of times, do go for these first as some queue do get long as the crowd pours in. The slides are really the main attraction here and playing these all day is definitely worth it, though could be tiring. Other than the slides, there's also a wavy pool which doesn't really have any waves, a water playground which is also very fun and a slow floaty ride around the area. Although we only spent half a day here, this park alone could definitely be a full day activity as repeating the rides and attraction is definitely recommended.The theme park is much larger in comparison, all the rides are fun, some exciting but nothing too extreme. There's also indoor activities in between, and some rides are for kids only. Exploring the area is certainly nice and the mini land is very very nice place to relax and enjoy some beautiful views of buildings around the world. The stores near the entrance is also a fun place to be for lego fans, so many merchandises to choose from!Doing both parks in a day is tiring but doable if you can skip some rides or areas, but two days is definitely a much better choice. It's a great place not only for family and kids but also for friends who have passion for lego and enjoy having fun at a theme park as well.",5.0
1910,Wonderful experience at Legoland,"We simply enjoyed our time here and the kids found it memorable. If you visit Singapore, I really recommend a dotour here. Its got a variety for young children. The Star Wars miniland blew me away and I saw Legoland as art for the first time",5.0
1911,Better than Disneyland!,"We loved our visit.  My son loves Lego.  Admission was inexpensive and great value.  A thunderstorm arrived and most people left, we stayed on and got on every ride without a queue.  My son says it's better than Hong Kong Disneyland and I agree with him especially in how affordable the price is.  ",5.0
1912,Plan your day - especially foodwise,Three boys under 13 - Legoland was a must do activity and they were not dissapointed - why - because they had each methodically scoured the map of the park on the website and wasted no time in plotting activities in order of logistics and priority. The train is only worth doing if there is no wait. Don't bother with it just walk. The shopping for actual Lego was the same price as rest of the world and the range was not as good as larger department stores - so save you time and luggage space for the park experience. Definitely do the water park option as well - a very nice end to the day. Highlight for us was the star wars exhibit.,4.0
1913,family trip,remember to bring sunscreen & umbrella.Lot of outdoor activities for children. parking is quite convenient. Quite a few cafes to settle your meal,3.0
1914,excellent for young kids,"The rides are great for kids up to about ~12. Our kids 4 & 6 loved it and we plan to return. The rooms were nicely outfitted with bunk beds and lego themed items everywhere. The food was so so, lots of french fries and typical resort fast food. ",5.0
1915,Fun with the Kids,"This is definitely a paradise for the kids.....be sure they are 120cm or taller to enjoy all rides :)  queue was short, games was nice for the kids NOT for adults or teenagers.bring extra water as the weather can get pretty hot.overall i give it a 100/100 from a mother to a 5 years old :D",5.0
1916,Fun for the kids,"My 6-year-old son loves this place! Why wouldn't he? It's a great place to spend the entire day at. It was his second time to Legoland Malaysia. The first visit was 3 years ago, when he was still too short to go on most of the 'big kid' rides.The minimum height requirement for most of the rides is 110cm, 90cm for some. They're very strict in enforcing this. So, my suggestion would be to only go when your kids are taller than 110cm.",5.0
1917,Annual Pass holder. Goes more for the Brick Shop,"The Theme Park is currently under partial renovation with some parts of it closed for new rides. Personally I don't take much of the rides as I go there more often than not to purchase LEGO bricks (they sell by weight). It is cheaper than in Singapore. While at the same time, I will walk around the park mostly to find inspiration for my next LEGO build. ",4.0
1918,Quality time with your kids.,"Legoland Malaysia¬†brings together a LEGOLAND Park, Water Park & Hotel in one LEGO¬†themed location. It is a family holiday destination with more than 70 hands-on rides, slides, shows & attractions. Almost everything = hands-on, so u can push, pedal & program, or steer, squirt & splash, ur way through a truly interactive experience ‚Äì & of course there‚Äôs building too.",5.0
1919,Nice for families,"We went as a family of 5. Nice attractions, nice exebitions, with lots of great displays of sites and famous asian tourist places all made of lego. The attraction was nice, not great, too small and too short, but a ok mix of attractions covering kids at age 4 -14. The satisfaction of our one-day stay, stepped up several steps as we entered the poolarea and gone swimming. Our 14yo wanished up to the big slides, and didn't come back until our end of the stay. That indicated that he found lots of fun up there to keep him busy and happy. Our two other kids 2 and 5yo also enjoyed to the full the smaller pools for the kids. In the end, a very nice stay for big and small!",4.0
1920,"Quiet, no queues and cheap",We visited legoland on a day trip from singapore and were reminded just how inexpensive Malaysia is when compared with Singapore. The park is a great attraction and was made doubly so by the lack of crowds -in fact the place was empty which allowed my children to walk straight onto rides without queuing.The only downside to our day was caused by the huge delays (well over 80 minutes ) at immigration controls as we re-entered Singapore.Getting the joint ticket that also includes the adjacent waterpark makes for a really full day.,5.0
1921,Most suited for young families,"Visited with my partner on a hot sunny day and we left within two hours. Legoland Malaysia is quite decent only if you have young children in tow. Otherwise, wouldn't recommend spending >2 hours there. The highlight of the trip was the intricate miniature models of South-east Asian countries they had on display. Those were really impressive. On a side note, I hope the management can consider building a few more indoor attractions that would help provide visitors with a respite from the intense heat.",3.0
1922,Just simple great fun!,"We spent the day at Legoland.  It was mid-week and very very quiet.  Apparently on the weekend it's really busy but for us there were no queues, especially after lunch when it got quite hot.  This really aimed at families with kids up to about 12 or so.  There were no rides my 6 year old wouldn't go on so long as she was tall enough. It's a great place, lots of fun, and the lego cities are great.   Was disappointed with the lego shop. It's supposed to be one of the biggest in Asia and although it's big and there is a lot to choose from, I was hoping for some rarer choices to purchase. Everything there you can get online or from larger toy shops.",5.0
1923,Good for young kids,"The variety of games / rides that are suitable for 3-5 years old are quite a lot.  And the best part is that, it's usually not that crowded and so lining up time is 5-10 mins for most games. A good place for family to spend a whole day. Just a bit limited on food selection within the park.  Hope the variety will improve in time. ",4.0
1924,Lego Happiness,A fantastic theme park with a wide variety of attractions in a relatively manageable space. Good for all ages although skewed slightly to younger ages.The attention to detail is amazing with absolutely everything lego themed!!,5.0
1925,"A fun visit for my son, but getting a little run down","We took a private car from Singapore for a one day visit. We went on a Monday to avoid crowds and were so glad we did! Very short lines everywhere, and easy to see everything. While my 10 yr old son loved the Lego building the place itself is showing some wear. I suppose the hot sun there and elements really take a toll but some exhibits looked beat up. For example in miniature land, there were a number of models that were under construction, where water was really low and the boats etc didn't float. Many of the mini models had moving features that didn't move anymore. It also felt smaller to me tha legolands in the US. Having said that, we did enjoy our day. The kids liked the Rides and building. In the car race area, there weren't really enough big pieces for everyone to build car to race so people were all scoping out tables and snatching pieces when others left. So more big pieces there would have been great. I think our kids (ages 10 and 11) were on the high end of enjoying. Better for younger kids. In hindsight if I had to choose I would have done sentosa island and universal studios for the day instead of dealing with traveling 3 plus hours to/from Legoland. ",3.0
1926,Adorable and so clean,"I went here as a 24 year old by myself and I enjoyed it a lot. True, with kids you will have access to more rides and the intensity level is higher, but I loved all thr sceneries they build and all the decor around the attractions. I was lucky, there wereno queues at all. Staff all friendly and the whole park is really clean. Definitely a must do while in JB.",4.0
1927,Best day for kids,"Went for a visit during the week where it was not a school holiday. Really made a difference where there was almost no queue to go for rides. Rode more than 10 rides in one day. Not as big as the one in Windsor but would be adequate enough comparatively. The 4d movie was totally awesome.. Food surprisingly nice and affordable.. staff very helpful all around.. parking not very far.. the only setback was the waterland as it was close the day we went, so call ahead before booking especially if it was a rainy day!!",5.0
1928,Nice place but prefer for kids above 4 yo,"It's a medium amusement park and the weather is very hot you need umbrella and hat, the nices things are go shooping lego at Bigshop becoz the price are nice üëçüèª",4.0
1929,Different to the bigger parks,"Definately doesn't have all the big rides or shows as a universal or Disney. But this was our 4 year old sons favourite. Many parks and lots of things for younger children to do rather than just rides. I would say it's best suited to 3-10 year olds.We visited from Singapore in a private driver car, left around 8:45am and arrived about 10:15am. The park was pretty empty all day. Was great to have no wait time any longer than 5 minutes to get on a ride.We did also have the combo to visit the waterpark. Read on the website it's open til 9pm. So went over at about 5:30pm, only to be told all the slides close at 6pm. Only the wave pool is open til 9pm!!! It should really be made clearer on the website even though we probably should have double checked when we arrived.Even with this miscommunication we still had a great day.",5.0
1930,Wonderful playground for children,This park have 2 parts where one is theme park and the other one is water swimming park. They are both suitable for children who is 3 years old or above. The fee of tickets is expensive and not much worth. So waiting for promotion or you buying tickets through hotel counter is better and cheaper and they always have such promotions. The theme park is a lot of visitor until 4 o'clock and i suggest playing in the morning. There is a lot of outdoor open playground for children aged below 3.,5.0
1931,More fun than I though :),Ok wasn't really wanting to visit this place but the wife insisted and lucky she did !We parked at the Lego land car park costs RM$10 via touch and go upon exit or pay cash before you return to the car park. The car park surface is horrible and I would recommend parking at the mall car park instead at Rm$2 it's just as close to Lego land and way safer as they have security guards there. DONT park at Lego land hotel as it cost $50! I would also strongly suggest staying at Lego land hotel as the hotel is super fun for kids Inc teens and honestly adults :)The park was great but ensure u check the weather forecast and buy tickets 7 days earlier to save on park entry. If your local it's cheaper by $40 a person. Kids below 3 are free but I suggest you go when your child is above 3 and about 110am tall to maximize all the rides which are a lot of fun.The food wasn't bad either I would recommend eating at the pizza joint which has the better food and mid way point for all rides.Please bring along another set of clothes to change to of you want to take the water based rides in the theme park the body dryer they have doesn't work well and waste of money rm$10.Do not get both theme park tickets for one day you can't finish both parks in one day such my suggestion to stay over one night.,5.0
1932,A great park with no overcrowding,"Before I start , beware of the money changer at the Medini Mall , he will give you the worst rate possible !Legoland is a beautiful park with a nice choice of rides and the best part , is the longest queu is five minutes , this area of Malaysia is hot so get hydrated ! They are still expanding the park , and I did not get a chance to visit the Water Park yet ",5.0
1933,Fun themepark,great place to have your childhood remembrance & great place for family... kids will love it big time. make sure you have enough time to play all the rides :) at least 5 hours,5.0
1934,Enjoyable Theme park for Kids,"We went there on a Friday as we are trying to avoid crowd during weekend. We took a cab from City Square at MYR 40 to the park. Alternatively you can take causeway link bus from JB Sentral at a lower cost. For the water park, a bit of disappointment as the maintenance wasn‚Äôt that done very well. There is sight of peeling paint on the water pool area and some of the lego bricks are found with cracks (these should be discard away to avoid kids being hurt). Nevertheless kids will still enjoy the water park. And for the Dry area, there are a couple of play areas, kiddy rides like airplane or train,  roller coaster, a 4D movie theatre, Lego show which I like the best as it is very innovative. If you are feeling tired and need a rest, there are several restaurants with different cuisine available in the park. Retail shop is another place I like to visit as there are stuffs that is not available in my country is sold here. If you ask me whether I‚Äôm keen to come again, the answer is yes",4.0
1935,The perfect place for a family vacation with younger kids,"Legoland Malaysia is probably one of the best kept secrets for anyone outside of Malaysia. As an Australian who regularly visits Singapore, most people don't even know there is a Universal Studios theme park on Sentosa... So mention Legoland and they simply glaze over!Legoland Malaysia is only an hour from Singapore by car -- and it is well worth blocking off a couple of days for loads of fun if you have children from 2-12 or older. There is a Legoland Hotel as part of the complex which combines with the Parks for a totally immersive Lego experience.So our trip to Legoland this year was our second from Australia, via Singapore and we stayed at the Legoland Hotel -- the Hotel sent a car for us in Singapore and drove us over (and ultimately back) for a reasonable fee.Legoland Malaysia comprises a theme park and a water park. You can buy various ticket combinations for one or both and some accommodation deals at the hotel also include tickets to the park.Malaysia is a hot and humid place, so we typically went to the theme park in the mornings and then cooled off in the water park in the afternoon.The theme park is large, with lots of rides and attractions to entertain your kids (and adults too). Kids can drive lego cars, boats and planes or ride the Lego train; there are shoot-em-up rides, droppy rides, flume rides (splashy), rollercoasters, immersion 4D rides, playgrounds, lego building stations (from simple to advanced robotics) and some quite quirky and different rides that the kids loved.The two times we've been were both mid-week (Tues, Wed and Thurs) and the park was uncrowded. There were no queues to get on rides - which my 6- and 8-year-old hate - so we went on pretty much everything -- over and over and over again.75% of all the rides are suitable for kids of all ages, unlike parks like Universal where there is limited choice for the little ones.The theme park also includes a city made of Lego that the kids find fascinating, which features models of famous buildings from all over Asia.Next to the theme park - but with a separate entrance and a separate ticket required - is the Legoland waterpark.The waterpark is a perfect way to spend the afternoon because the weather is typically hot and humid.The waterpark features my favourite waterpark attraction - the lazy river - with flotation vests available for the kids in all sizes. The river also includes lots of huge Lego bricks that you can use to build rafters and other flotation devices with -- then you can float around the loop in the current all day if desired. There are also inflatable tyres available for the less constructive.The waterpark also includes a wave pool - not too aggressive and suitable for young kids - plus loads of water slides, some with rafts and tyres, others without.The first time we went to Legoland, we spent two days there with our then 4 and 6 year old. This time, with the kids 6 and 8, we stayed 3 days and could have easily stayed longer. We stayed at the Legoland Hotel, right next door, for a fully immersive Lego experience and one our kids will never forget.",5.0
1936,Immigration process terrible!,If you want travellers to visit from singapore significant improvements need to be made with regards to immigration process. Not worth the effort to travel to Legoland especially with small children. ,3.0
1937,Kids will like it !,"Yes, kids will love it but not really for adults. The attraction are design mainly for small kids instead of adults. Adult or parent will visit this place mainly due to accompany their kids. Legoland should consider offer cheaper price for adults since not many attractive are design for them. This park should have taller tree or more shielder to cover the hot sun. They should offer free drinking water refill in public area since they not allow outside foods and drinks.In overall my family are quite enjoy in this park. Will consider visit again  if they have offer on ticket otherwise will be quite costly to us.",4.0
1938,So humid so hot and very limited shade at all games and rides area,Should improve add more shaded rest area for visitor avoid expose to hot sun. Not recommended to elderly people to hang around at rides and games area. Also have to well apply sunblock to avoid sunburn to kids. Once it's enough will not visit again.,3.0
1939,Restrictions not clear,"The brochure has mention the min height for the rides, but not the min age. Hence, we made some in vain walks to the rides to find out that the child has met the height limit but not then age limit. This could be made clearer.",3.0
1940,Loved it ,"So much fun for kids, many of the rides are for kids 4 and up and at least 100cm, if you don't have that at least there are some games and things little ones can do, our kids loved the Star Wars as a top choice and the driving school, they enjoyed it! We arrived at 10 am which is the opening hour and we didn't encounter long lines, it is sunny so you should have some type of gear for the sun, sunscreen, hats etc, and we left when they closed which is at 6/7 pm, and we are not in to rides so imagine, there is a water park which we didn't go to so I guess that's an additional day, we had breakfast and lunch over there, the doughnuts at the cafe at entrance are amazing!!! And the food is very good, we are at a chicken parlour that had an amazing chicken and I don't eat chicken that much so it was really good, also I loved the store for Legos at the end, you can buy any type of Lego by weight and the selection is huuuuge so I made some tailor made boxes (they sell Lego boxes that look like Legos) for each of my kids with things and colors to make transformers and cars, I haven't found that selection anywhere, there is a playroom to make cars and race and my 2 and 4 year old girl and boy loved it! So if you have the chance and your kids enjoy Legos go ",5.0

1943,Better than I expected,"This place is enjoyable or not, I supposed it depends on your expectation. I have heard primary school students said it's boring. I've heard parents said it's great! (mostly with young kids). I'm an 30+yrs old adult. I enjoyed my visit. I had ""fun"" playing the not-scary-at-all-to-most-people roller coaster (it's scary to me still). I had fun playing the games which you need to pay for and try to win a prize. I had fun taking photos at the mini world. I thoroughly enjoyed the 4d movie. Its area is bigger than I thought. My only complaint is the car park... is very..to put it simply..""lousy"". Legoland has opened for so long. I'd thought there'd be a proper car park with proper tar road... Other than that, it was a nice visit for me and my friend. We spent half a day there.",5.0
1944,"Not that worth for the cost, still USS is much better.","the rides are not worth, it may good for kids who love lego. the minimum height is 80CM or 3year whichever is lower. the food inside is not bad on King's grill, but cost wise come out from LEGOLAND and eat there, not may options outside ( you have like secret receipe, johor kitchen, old town white coffee and other 2 local Chinese restaurant)the cos is 50% cheaper than inside. The lock point here is if you want to come out LEGOLAND and go in make sure you have combo pass to enter any time. If you buy one day pass you have no choice once you come out cant go in back.",3.0
1945,Disappointed,"If not about Lego theme, his themepark is more likely to be a chinese themepark. So many chinese tourist which make me wonder I am in Malaysia or China.The park open 10 am. Don't come too early maybe 9:30 or 9:45 is early enough. My driver took me from Singapore and arrive here at 8:00 am. They said there are many restaurant and photo taking opportunity. However all of the restaurant open at 10 am as well and to take picture around here 10-15 min is more than enough.The ride and show is pretty ok if your kid like lego very much. If not it is not worth trveling here.I'll not be back again.",2.0
1946,Theme Park with a mission,"Sitting on a rather huge plot of land within Nusajaya.A wide welcoming entrance into the mystical land of lego figures. Remember to get a ride card for the kids to get stamps once they had the rides. These give the kids a sense of mission.Personally, loves to visit ALL parks in a clockwise direction. Couple of roller coaster type rides namely technic, dragon apprentice and The Dragon.It will always be good to have a poncho along for the totally WET adventure ride.The Egypt zone is a laser shooting miner ride.Driving School and Boating School is quite interesting for the children.The mini world is not as majestic as those they had elsewhere...but its fantastic enough to have landmarks brick up with lego blocks.",4.0
1947,Good place for family,"Family with young children will definitely love this place. Full of entertainment, and the rides are interesting.

1948,Good for young kids,"We went on the National Day holiday which was not crowded at all! One thing to note is that if you are purchasing the online tickets, do bring along your ID with you as they need to verify that you are the rightful owners of the tickets. We spent about 5hours there, doing most of the rides. But if you want to do every single ride and watch every show, think you will need a allocate a full day. My 10 year old enjoyed herself whereas my 2 year old could only go on 2 rides so she was quite bored. But on the whole, it was a fun trip, much better than Universal Studios Singapore.

Umbrella, sun screen, insect repellent (lots of mosquitoes), poncho / raincoat, a ton of water and lots of snacks for hungry kids. Legoland plastic poncho sells for RM12, if I'm not mistaken, and don't forget a lot of rides are closed on rainy days. Those with young kids are advised to bring a stroller because rental of stroller is not free. Food is very expensive by Malaysian standard inside as well as at the Medini Mall adjacent to the theme park.  Be prepared to pay more than RM10 to RM20 for a simple meal, per person.

1965,Horrible customer service and management of a famous theme park,"I was here on 4 Apr 2015. Travelled here for 1h via bus from JB Sentral. Upon reaching at 1pm, we were told by 1 of the employees at the bus park that the theme park was closed due to contaminated water supply. He was not even holding any loudhailer, nor microphone, we were the only 2 persons who saw him waving and said the park was closed.He asked us to come back another day, or extend our ticket for 1 year by queueing up to endorse. I argued that nobody told us that when we boarded the bus (which is actually a special bus that goes to Legoland from JB Sentral). He told us that they announced it on their Facebook, and told us to call to check the next time we come. (PS: I checked their Facebook after that, there were no announcement at all!)We approached the park's entrance, which was some 5 min distance away from the park. We saw the long queue for the endorsement of the tickets, and reckoned it will take us another 1h to queue, and decided to turn back.Upon coming back to Singapore, we sent an email to them on 7 Apr to ask for extension of the tickets and even attached the picture of the tickets. They did not reply until we sent another chase email on 1 May. Afterwhich, the Guest Service Liaison explained the situation, and told us that the park was actually reopened at 2:30pm, and they even extended the park opening to 8pm (which is only an extra 1h).They ended the email with ""We are pleased to inform you that both your tickets are valid until 18th June 2015"" which we obviously already knew. She clearing did not read our email properly as she was not answering our request at all.We sent a reply to them again, asking for extension of the tickets, and their exact reply was:We are able to revalidate the tickets (6months) providing you are agreeable to top-up the 6% GST per ticket.Below is the process;1 ‚Äì We will raise the Revalidation Form once we received the original tickets2 ‚Äì Approval from management3 ‚Äì Our Finance Department will send you the invoice (6% GST per tickets from the purchase rates)4 ‚Äì Payment made by you5 ‚Äì Ticket will be printed6 ‚Äì Ticket will be pass / courier to youAll these troubles, just because they wanted another 6% GST for our 2 tickets which was RM10.80 X 2 = RM21.60!In the end, we just decided to use our ticket and went into JB again in May 2015. I called up the hotline just before boarding the bus to Legoland, just to be sure that there are no water supplies issues this time. The operator on the other end told us that they were not told of any water supply issues, I insisted that she ask before confirming with us, which she did. The staff are clearly not trained for such situations.The visit was alright, mostly kids rides. Really amazed with the miniland though.

1971,worth a visit,"We did enjoy ourselves, but were a little disappointed that it is not cared for that well, my grandson loved it, he's 6, it is worth the visit but on the day we went they kept shutting rides so was hard to get round them all, nothing to rave about  but it is worth visiting",3.0
1972,good for the kids,"NZ$145 for seniors.  Could spent all day here with children.  Limited appeal.  Animals life size in Lego. Asian tourist sites in Lego.  Plenty of food, drinks available.  Expensive day out.  Combined pass gives entry to water world.  Once was enough.  Would not go again at that price.",4.0
1973,Has improved but dissapointing food choices,"Have been a regular visitor since the park opened, but I am surprised why the resort and the park is so punishing on Vegetarians . Theres hardly any vegetarian food available and this despite me visiting for the past three years. The giant fans and increased greenary has made the visits more pleasant.The legoland hotel is a good ione time experience. But the service standards in the hotel is quite bad. I checked into a family room and the Bathroom Sink would not drain of water and remained unattended despite complaints. Thats sad.Its got a small pool but overall good for kids to experience it",3.0

There is also a restaurant in the theme parks. Toilets are quite clean. There are plenty rides to go on for free so try to get on everything if you can! (Joking) If you are coming from Singapore and you are not Singapore citizen/PR or Malaysian it might take a long time to go pass the custom. So plan your trip well before you go. You can stay in a local hotel or in LEGOLAND hotel if you don't mind the cost, them go to the parks as soon as they open for the day.",5.0
1976,worth the visit,we were told on booking the tickets that it was a good place for kids and not so much adults...(my 21 year old daughter and i went on this trip) but we decided to go along anyway and were quite delighted we did as we had so much fun and thoroughly enjoyed all that the place had to offer even at our age...specially liked the mini cities! would definitely go again!,5.0

1980,So much fun,My husband and I were staying in KL yesterday while on holiday and we decided to fly to Legoland for the day which was so easy to do and if you fly Air Asia it is super cheap.It is hard to believe how cheap this place is as it is such an awesome and high quality theme park.The actual Lego displays are phenomenal and the rides are really fun to. We went on a Monday and there were hardly any lines at all.This park caters for adults and children and even if you were not into Lego you would find it hard not to enjoy yourself.Yes it was very hot here but the park does their best to make it bearable by having lots of air conditioned options to break up the day and there are lots of fans around.This place has very clean toilets and I was surprised at how cheap the food was here considering they don't allow pass outs.If you are staying in KL I definitely recommend you go here for a lot of fun.,5.0

1983,Kids love it!,"A great place to visit for a day of fun, start in the morning with the main theme park. Note that some rides are really for little kids only but there was enough to keep my two teenage kids entertained. Afternoon was spent in the water park, and the kids loved it! But please bring your own towels; the rented towels were so expensive we felt ripped off. The towels were the only negative point of the whole experience. ",4.0
1984,Fun theme park for kids ,"Overall was a satisfy trip. Been to the wet and dry parks. Need to pay more attention to the maintenence such as the 4D Studios, some of cushioning has been detached from the seats and corrosion on the metallic parts.Would visit again when the new attraction is opened in Nov 2016.",4.0
1985,Awesome day ,"We went on a Monday in July. The weather was perfect, but hot when there was no cloud cover, and the park was not very busy. We rarely had to line up and wait for any rides. There was some limits on my 2 year old but we said he was 3 and was able to get onto most rides he wanted. My 6 year old had the best time ever, the roller coasters were the high lights for her. The park it self was better than expected, some things were a bit old, but not too bad. Plenty for the kids to do. We were finished by abt 2pm having arrived at 10am. Helped not having to wait in lines.Food was average but a nice relief from the humid heat. Heaps of was to spend extra money on show stalls or picture, but the staff were not annoying. Good solid day of fun for the kids.  ",4.0
1986,A PARADISE TO LITTLE TODDLERS,"If you want your toddlers to have the greatest time of their early lives, bring them here.

After all, the happiness you'll see in the eyes of your children is priceless. ",5.0
1987,Great Day,"The day we went was very quiet, so no waiting for rides. A great mixture of rides.

A great time was had by young and older ones. ",4.0

1989,Everything is Awesome,We had the 2 day combo pass and stayed at the Legoland Hotel. Our children are 5 & 9 and loved every minute of it. Highly recommend.,5.0
1990,For the Big Kids!!,I went with a friend as adults. We loved it. It is a park for kids but we went on a rainy day so the park was really quiet. We didn't have to line up for very long and we could go on rides over and over again. We got the 2 day pass so that meant to we go from the water park to the park and back again. If you want to make the most of it a 2 day pass is good because u can go to both parks. We also bought the tixs online so it was cheaper. Lock your things up in a locker so you can roam freely. You can't predict the weather but its pretty bad if its a hot day because there is hardly any shade. If its overcast and wet then its great because u get wet anyway (at the water park),4.0
1991,Terrific destination if you and your family members are LEGO fans,"As the title of this review says, it is quite important that you are going because you are a loyal fan of the brand. Otherwise you may feel a bit disappointed with what the theme park offers. It does not offer anything particularly special compared to other theme parks, except everything if LEGO themed. On the other hand, if LEGO is the family's hobby then you all will have a great time.Few disappointments we had was several attractions were closed for maintenance, which was not informed on the dedicated web page they have. The other thing is, there are very few attractions for toddlers aged 4 and younger.",4.0
1992,Average experience,"Visited dry park only. 01 day enough for dry park.Obviously place for young children, not much for adults.",3.0
1993,Kids had a great time,"We spent half a day at the water park. One of their water features was under renovation. The second day we spent a whole day at the theme park which opens at 10am and closes at 6pm. Buy a plastic rain coat or a bring a change of clothes if you want to go on the dinosaur island wet ride. You will be soaked right through. Your kids need to meet a height requirement to go on the rides, and some rides require height and age (6 years old) requirements. I would say bring your kids here when they are 6 years old and are tall enough to go on all the rides 120cm tall.",4.0
1994,Fun but EXTREMELY HOT TEMPERATURE !,"Legoland in Malaysia is just a niche market attraction because it is rather small in size for theme park because I have been to the best theme park in the world which are Disneyland in Japan, Los Angeles and Florida. Legoland is the size of Universal in Singapore (again another downgrade in size as compared to the original Universal in LA). So if you have been to Disney, don't bother to go Legoland unless you are in a tight budget and time. Nothing wrong with Legoland Malaysia but I just felt downgraded having been to Disney. Again if you have never been to Disney then Legoland is ok. The attraction quite ok especially since they added Star Wars (again niche market material). However the sunny weather was extremely hot to the point you need to protect babys and young ones (or even elderly). May I go again ?  P r o b a b l yDo I look forward to it ? Maybe not",4.0

1996,mediocre park.. customer service terrible we got robbed..literally,"ok... so how do i begin, we were in legoland for 3 days, we were staying at the hotel... on the first day at the park my husbands wallet got stolen from my bag, my husband spent the entire day at guest services and then went to the police station in the evening to report it, and although not the staffs fault, the way it was handeled was wrong, he was there for 5 hours in which we were told that all department heads were informed and even the cleaning people to check the rubbish bins.. however.. THREE hours later i went and stopped by all of the rides again and the staff operating it had no idea PLUS i stopped a few garbage men to check the rubbish and they had no clue about a missing wallet.. so that left a very bitter taste .. on top of that nothing was offered as compensation, again not the parks fault but they were aware of the situation had sat all day with my husband AND then lied to us about notifying the relevant people, all they could say was sorry.. at least give the kids a voucher for the store.. free lunch anything to show they have an interest or care at what happens to their visitors.. the park itself is ok.. nothing wow.. its small it seems dated and there really isn't much to do you can EASILY finish it in a day. the only person who tried to help and showed some concern was Shukry, even the next day he said nothing had turned up.. and although he was the most helpful it still wasnt on par of what you would expect from a proper establishment.

1997,Absolutely fantastic!,"I totally rated Legoland & the Water Park next door. My 3 kids loved it, heaps of different activities for kids & adults. Nice to have so many different themed areas. Heaps of fun but stay in the hotel to get early entry & make the most of both parks. ",5.0

1999,"Great Fun, but Overpriced","I visited both the wet park and the dry park during the weekday. What I like was that it wasn't crowded, so you can slide/ride as many times as you like. The overall scenery is wonderful, although the rides are average.It'll be fun for families and friends. Although I do think the tickets are on the pricier side.",5.0
2000,Could've been better! ,"We are now annual pass holder of Legoland. having lived in Japan the last 3 years, the legoland is no where what I expected it to be. Nobody cares about the well being of the place, broken Legos- where the monuments are, some attractions not working and leaves scattered everywhere. The staff of legoland are not helpful. They have no good customer service attitude, if your child is stuck in a game, they just ignore him/her instead of helping them. Talking loudly to each other and ignoring the customers are what they are best at. The games in legoland are like a circus game that comes to town, nothing really exciting. Food is pricy, but if you decide to have lunch you can always eat out at mall of medini.I can't wait for Legoland in Japan to open, I'm sure it's amazing and the staff care about what they do. ",3.0
2001,Play with kiddos aged 6-7 years,"I was here last June 2016, during fasting period and weekday. Enjoyed the place with my 2 kids aged 6 and 7 years.

Money wise.",3.0
2002,Had a wonderful time,"We visited legoland with our three kids (12, 9, 6) on a week day. It was mostly empty and we were lucky the weather was AMAZING. It's very clean and the restaurants are nice. We had a wonderful time. ",5.0
2003,Excellent fun for all ages!,"If you want to take advantage of all rides, check the height restrictions.  My child was 3 and under 100cm and could not go on many of the rides!  In July the queue time was less than 5 mins every time!  Excellent park, lots to keep you going!",5.0
2004,Great for young kids 6 and under,Nice little theme park suited to smaller kids.Take a rain poncho - torrential rain for an hour or so each day we were there.Need 2 full days to visit both the park and the water park and don all of the rides at least once.,4.0
2005,Great Place for Kids. They love it!,"A great place for kids if you and kids are fan of Lego. Located not far from crossway 2 into Singapore at Iskandar, it is a place to visit. The theme park is fun and next to it are the water theme park and Lego themed hotel. Mind you the rooms certainly has lego themed in it but it is extremely expensive to stay during the holiday period.

2006,the theme park is so cool!!,"I travel with my family, two daughters, 5 and 7 years old. So happy can visit this place. My advise is don't arrange your trip only 1 day if you want to visit theme park and water park. You should separate in two days, since the park is so big. And don't forget to bring your umbrella. The rest is very good place to visit! Strongly recommended for family. ",4.0

2008,I feel Regret to spend my holiday here,"If you earn Malaysia Ringgit, I will tell you don't go, the price you pay doesn't bring you the value; if you are youngsters who plan to go with your friends, I will tell you choose other place, it is more likely for family with kids; If you bring your kids over there, your kids will like it but not you! I bought a promotion ticket at the price of RM135, and I expect that I will spend my whole day inside Theme Park. I even worried that I do not have enough time to play all the games there, and thus I went there in early morning. However, I was disappointed! The games, the facilities are designed more to kids. Not only this, the theme park is very small and the facilities are very limited. I am wondering is this consider as international Theme Park? They should at least set up more games that suit for adult.  In fact, I feel bored inside the Theme Park. I end up spend half day inside and leave there for other entertainment!",1.0
2009,"Price Up, Same Old","I was here in May 2015, just revisited again June 2016. Quality and rides still the same, the only changes are (1) Price went up for both Food + Ticket, perhaps 15%.   (2) New NinjaGo show Realm of Shadows.   The NinjaGo show was a major disappointment. Large NinjaGo characters were all manually hold up and controlled by the puppet masters. Example. Ninja Kai was just a large 5 foot puppet, and there are 2 puppet masters or performers in black ninja suit standing right behind Kai, move/manipulate Kai's hands, legs, neck, and mouth. So on a stage with 2 Ninja characters + 1 Dragon, you would see many more men-in-black running around busy moving these 3 puppets!! What a Joke!! Cheap production. The other bad experience was the Lego Car Race Track, where kids build the lego cars and race down the track. One of the race track was broken but the staff seem oblivious to it. Still, the theme park is a fun place for the young. Especially if you live in the adjacent  lego hotel.Remember to bring your own ponchos for the ride on Dino Island as it gets very wet. But the Dino Island ride is boring. Just a steep stair up, 10-seconds story telling, then straight plunge into water. During my stay, Malaysia school holiday was over but Singapore holiday is still on. So there is some que though nothing significant. Most rides are without que.",4.0
2010,Water park the surprise highlight - but be aware of closures if thunderstorms hit,"We had a two day pass to the parks purchased with our Legoland Hotel accommodation - Legoland ""proper"" and the Legoland water park next door.  The pass gave as many entries and exits as we wanted to each park for the two days.We got a bit lucky with the weather - first day we headed to Legoland proper thinking we might go to the waterpark later in the day.  A thunderstorm hit late morning closing the water park and some of the rides but meant we got to do some the kids liked multiple times. Weather cleared and the place was pretty empty for the afternoon so lots of rides with little queues.The second day was very nice weather and we headed to the water park - initially just for the morning but we all had so much fun we stayed most of the day.  Watch the sun though... We foolishly thought it wouldn't we bad compared to NZ sun and got badly sunburned.  Back to the park for the late afternoon and two tired kids after two full on days.We've been to Windsor Legoland previously - this one is probably on a par.  Much less people.",4.0

2015,"Kids loved it, but overall average","This was a long overdue trip, though since Johor is far for many Malaysians, the park seems to be more obviously targeting Singaporians.  Our kids had a great time (ages 12, 10, 8), though our baby (1 yr) didn't have much to do in the park.  As its always rainy season in Johor, we thought there should be more indoor activities and cover in the outdoor areas.  There were some, but there is a restriction on bringing strollers in any of the shops or indoor buildings.  This is a problem when its rainy outside (and the stroller parking area provides a very small covered section), or if your baby is sleeping.  I can understand the rule during busy seasons, but this was not peak season for the park and there was plenty of indoor space.  The height restrictions prevented an adult from holding the baby on the most basic of little kids rides (the tiny train in the duplo area).  As for the other rides, with a few exceptions, most are just nicer looking versions of any basic carnival that you can find anywhere.  The few exceptions, like the car driving area, gave a bit more freedom to the kids that you would find elsewhere.Most people complain about the food, and you will find it referred to on blogs as ""insane"" prices.  Yes the prices are slightly high, but most meals seem to include drinks and desert.  Pricewise, its not so bad when you compare it to outside, just slightly higher.  In terms of quality, it is nothing special.  The pizza place had good food in all categories, except for the pizza itself.  Since they have very few varieties, you would think it would be easier (and faster) if they just sold by the slice instead of having you wait so long for it to cook.  The portion sizes are good though, so you definitely won't be hungry.Unfortunately, we didn't get to spend more than an hour in the water park.  We started it early in the day when the park was announcing it would be a nice sunny day.  1 hour later the thunder came causing everything to shut down.  Everything, including the little boat racing track and other mini activities.  Since it wasn't looking like it would clear up anytime soon, we left the park just in time for a few hours of heavy rain.  Like the water park, a lot will shut down at any hint of lightning in the dry park.  Only a few rides will be open, which *oddly* included the uncovered boat ride in the techno park.  So be ready to sign up for some indoor activies like mindstorms.For the good points of the park, miniland was very impressive.  The focus is the asian region, and they did a great job at depicting many countries and famous landmarks.  The other brick sculptures throughout the park were also very nice to see.",3.0
2016,Wonderful Experience!,"One of the highlights of my stay in JB Malaysia is the stunning LEGOLAND.  This is for young and Adults alike! Try it, each of us has been part of Lego  once in our life....this is the best way to see it in majestic samples in reality....",5.0
2017,A Lego fan must-do!,"Legoland Malaysia has 2 parks - the theme park and the water park. It will be good to spend a day in each to fully enjoy them as both have a lot to offer. My 8-year old daughter had lots of fun in the theme park as the rides were mostly for young kids. There are driving and boating schools, small roller coasters and lost of other kiddie rides. Lego fans would definitely love the robotics and other creativity classes available at the park. The mini land was unbelievable and I can just imagine the time and effort to create them. There were also some game booths all over the place that you pay separately to play and earn prizes. The food, however, leaves more to be desired and selection was quite few per resto. There are several restaurants scattered all over the place though so you may want to plan ahead where and what you want to eat. The water park slides were fantastic and my daughter and I could have gone through all of them over and over again. It can be tiring going up the stairs and sometimes having to bring the big water tubes but it is all worth it. All in all, Legoland Malaysia is a fun enjoyable place to kids, kids-at-heart and Lego fans. ",4.0
2018,Fun for Kids not to miss.....,We visited on Saturday but there is not much crowd. All rides are well planned and designed for kids.

We stayed at the hotel so had priority entry 30 minutes prior to the gates opening, this enabled us to get around the park and take many rides before lots of people arrived.  The kids got to go on lots of rides, not once but many times--something we couldnt do without a hour or so wait when we were in Europe Legoland.  The park is a must for young and old.  We all went on many rides and really enjoyed the park to its full.  ",5.0

We went on the Dragon 3 times in a row as no one was in line and eventually had to ask them to stop so we could get off. We will definitely go back in the future, the water park is great and we spent hours there in the afternoons cooling off and escaping the heat. These guys have the best Star Wars Lego exhibit and the mini city with all the buildings is amazing. Only issue was with the Lego driving centre, kids had to watch an educational video before getting in the cars and driving. Kids just want to have fun, break the road rules and crash into each other.

2026,Meh,"Overall, compared to Legoland in Carlsbad which I would give 4 stars, I am not impressed.  We have been members at the California location for many random years and have always been happy but I can't say the same for Malaysia after a day in this park.  The best things about this location include cleanliness and the impressive structures in Miniland.  While Miniland is not as vast as in CA, the structures are more complex, thoughtful and flat out amazing.  Of note, there is no Star Wars section in the Miniland here.  On the downside, customer service and food are incredibly bad.  The food throughout the park is literally some of the worst food I've had since public school lunch decades ago.  It makes IKEA food look and taste gourmet.  Additionally, while there are signs in the restaurants stating they care about food allergies, the signs are crap.  I asked three people in the restaurant if my shwarma wrap was dairy free, including the manager and it was NOT dairy free as confirmed by a mild allergic response.  AWESOME.  Separately, the customer service had me thinking Malaysia was previously a communist country as the customer service parallels Eastern Europe.  I do have to say my kids are having fun.  That being said, Legoland corporate will certainly be getting a letter from me when I get home. ",2.0
2027,Lovely place not to be missed in Johor ,"Amazing Lego structures everywhere, even the trash bins or inside the bush.

2029,This was a lot of fun,"We traveled to Lego Land from Singapore which was a mission changing busses etc. at the border but once we go there it was fun and cheap. I won't go into detail on every ride/slide/exhibition but being hot and sticky we spent most of the tim e in the water, the lazy river with foam blocks are fun and a good way to keep cool. we had a look around at the exhibitions but the water land was the best. All up 4 hours was enough to do and see everything and the gift shop was reasonably priced. The kids 8&6 still talk about how much they enjoyed it.Unlike most theme parks it was more suited to their age groups with them being able to go on all of the rides rather than missing out on the big kid ones.",4.0
2030,Value for money and time,"Its a dream come true to my kids. I brought them here on a Friday morning and surprise me there is just a bunch of people. I think its the best time if you want to maximise your rides and play without have to queue. My kids and i had a great time playing the roller-coaster about 3 times without have to walk out from the seats. Almost every rides / games we don't have to queue.

My suggestion - combined ticket to water park is great but we spent too long in Legoland and only had an hour in the water park and as we arrived all of the water rides were closing although the gate said they were open until later. Leave yourself enough time to make the most of both! Too good to miss out on the fun. ,5.0
2032,if you love lego you will love legoland,LEGOLAND is amazing my grand kids and their parents just loved our time there. we went on a week day so it wasn't to crowded so it was easy to walk around and enjoy all the lego towns etc. we stayed at LEGOLAND hotel which is just outside the gates.we spent the whole day there then did the waterpark the next day.food and drinks are a reasonable price.,5.0
2033,Good for young kids,"It's a very spacious park, also very new. Not much shelter to protect you form the sun. Wear very light clothes, hats and sun block. The cafe at the entrance is good, with choices of sandwiches, doughnuts, salads. Most of the attractions are for young children, but there are roller coasters, 4D cinema and a Lego city. A bit for everyone. If you are staying in Singapore, think twice because it's not that amazing and the will take like an hour to reach by car, 2 hours to reach by public bus, you need to alight at the immigration and wait for another bus, maybe even take the MRT in Singapore to reach your hotel. Too troublesome, not worth, when you have Universal Studios in Singapore (much better by far). If you take the tourism bus, you probably will have to stay the whole day, which is not a good idea as you can cover the park in about 4 hours. Don't plan the whole day there, unless you want to try the water park.",3.0
2034,Awesome fun especially for the kids...,One day is not enough to explore the whole place (theme park & wet park).. Get ready for day under the sun with lots of water (for drinking) and sunscreen lotion...its definitely a place for kids of all ages and adults who enjoy sun and filled with zest. But overall experience is pure fun..,4.0
2035,Great for big kids too,"Legoland Malaysia is not just for small kids - please dont be fooled by the revies. Its great for all ages. THe models of Asian monuments are phenomenal, particulary the working airport and shipyard. There are rides for all ages including some rollercoasters and a great log flume style ride. We are a couple in our twenties and while yes a few rides are not suitable for us, or we were simply too big, there was enough to fill a full day. We were the first people to arrive and among the last to leave. There are also 4D movies and building activites. The waterpark is small but a good add on at the end of the day with faster rides and a relaxing tube around lagoon. A great day, only downside is there is no public transport directly there, but thats OK.",5.0
2036,Theme park for children ,"Visit this theme park during our Ied fitri holiday in JB. If you have kids up to 12 years this is the perfect place to spend. The park offers many attraction and suitable for all family member. Dont forger to ride up the lego technic which the car can be ride for 4 persons and feel the sensation. Although the theme park not so huge but have complete facilities and restaurant as well. If you stay in the city centre, there are bus from causewaylink from JB central/Larkin (LM1) which can take you to this park at about RM.4.5 for 30 minutes. ",3.0
2037,"Fantastic for Kids, worth to be there for Kids","Approx. 45 min drive by car from Johor Bahru City and Taxi charge approx. MYR 100 with toll tax. Take big water bottle before entering to Lego Land (outside big store available at reasonable rate). Keep towel and extra dress or costume if you want to enjoy water park, water slide and water sports. You will not be allowed to take edible inside which you need to buy inside the park and plenty of non-veg options are available. For vegetarian, options are limited to Pizza, Bread and sandwich, ice-cream only. Need to walk a lot inside keep sunglasses, wear walking shoe and light clothes and hat (hot and sunny).",4.0
2038,"Terrific, well priced theme park for young kinds","We had a great time at Legoland with our boys, 5 and 7. This is a great place for young children and the park is larger than we were expecting. It was incredibly hot though so plan to cool off in one of the indoor areas. We spent 45 minutes building Lego cars and racing them down ramps. Also fun were the roller coasters, driving session, Star Wars displays, water splash and horsie ride. The staff were very friendly and polite. I see good customer service training at work here. Plenty to do in one day and for a reasonable price, particularly when compared to theme park prices in Australia. ",5.0
2039,A Must Visit Place,"With only 1.5-2 hours drive from Singapore, Legoland Malaysia is a place that you must visit, especially if you have young children. The rides are kids friendly and of course with lego theme. Amazing place and fun but the hot weather will make you drink a lot more, hats and sunglasses are a must, bring umbrella if you have to. Recommend to go here. However, the tickets are not for multiple entry, so once you're in, stay inside.",4.0
2040,FUN!,"This theme park is suitable to those young ages. Because there were rides that are specifically built for kids, but it's good for any age. I like the Project X and Dragon something hahahahaha.

2041,Perfect theme park day,"We came on father's day weekend, and surprisingly there was no crowd.  The gloomy skies threatened to pour but all we had was sporadic drips.  Weather was relatively comfortable.We were able to try as many rides as we wanted, booked a Lego robotics session, watched a few rounds of the Lego movies.The park is a little more complete now compared to when it first opened.  The Star Wars exhibit is quite nice, too bad we missed the May specials.  Ninjago land will be coming online later this year.  We might just get the Annual Pass next year.",4.0

2043,Legoland Water Park,"I have to say I was really disappointed with the Legoland Water Park.On the day we arrived, many of the single person slides were closed due to maintanance which meant that the lines for the water slides needing either a mat or a tube were incredible long.  I waited closed to 30 minutes to get a tube for one slide ride.My biggest frustration was that despite the slides being closed for maintanance, I did not see one staff member working on these slides.  If you are going to close the slides for maintanance, then common sense would indicate that you need more tubes to cater the the patrons.  My suggestion is to give the water park a miss.",1.0
2044,Great place,Stayed at Legoland Hotel with my wife and three children (age 9 - 4). They absolutely loved it.  The hotel room (Kingdom Rm) was well equipt with a queen bed in one room and a bunk with trundle bed in the other. The kids had a puzzle to find the combination to the safe with Lego Toys the prize. The Legoland them parks were great and perfect for our kids ages. They are right next to each other (dry park and water park) and also right next to the hotel so you can easily go between the three if you need to without wasting too much time.I would highly recommend this hotel and theme park as it was not too busy like some of the other ones you go to. We did not waste hours lining up for rides. ,4.0
2045,A truly family holiday destination,"If you really want to enjoy Legoland Malaysia, consider staying a night here so that you can enjoy both the theme park and water park. Your kids will definitely love it. By the way, prepare sunblock and umbrellas because it can be ultra hot during the day.",5.0
2046,"Lego crazy, fun day out for everyone!","The theme park is not huge, however in saying that, we were a family with 2 children (6&10) and we still spent a whole day. You can get in a bit earlier if you're staying at the resort (highly recommended), it may seem a bit of a ghost town of a theme park, but the upside is that there are minimal queues for the rides and the shows. Prices for Lego were quite reasonable (compared to Aust stores), food options were a but limited, but pricing reasonable also. The Ninjago show was great (and the A/C was very welcomed) - there is a new Ninjago attraction which will open at the end of this year. Overall, was a good place to spend a day with the family.",4.0
2047,Family visit to Legoland,Great day had by children in hot conditions.  Rides are mostly for 7-14 year olds. Most of souvenirs are Lego only.  No character based t shirts for purchase. If have young family this would be a good place to visit.  We were also luck as it was a quiet day.  Allow time to get through border if staying in Singapore. 6 hours is sufficient to get around park.,4.0
2048,A must go for theme park lover but do bear with the tropics heat,"Went to the park with 2 kids (4yo+2yo).. Older kids will enjoy it more but we still had a lot of fun. They have a leaflet listing down    To do list for kids 2yo and below and I found it very handy. Get a stroller or rent one at the right hand side store once u enter from the main entrance it cost myr60 for double and myr40 for single. It is very useful to us, don't have to worry of getting tired carrying kids and can shed them from the sun. We had lunch at pizza mania price wise is reasonable, if you are not a big eater a kid meal is good enough. 4D show have different titles at the intervals of 30mins for each session. Overall most of the queue are not more than 15min wait.. I love short queue! Even though it is a sweaty day but we had lotsa fun, my son said ""mommy, I'm very happy today!"". ",4.0

From the minute you walk into reception there is Lego to play with.We stayed 3 nights and to be honest we could have stayed longer to Explore Malaysia more.We got a 2 day pass for Legoland and the water park which was also fab as we could revisit our favorite rides and experiences twice.  Everything (hotel/Legoland/water park) is a short stroll and multi entry thru the day to the parks so we went back to the hotel during the day.The rooms in the hotel are spacious - ask for a top floor so you experience the lifts for longer.  Disco music and flashing lights, so much fun for kids (and adults alike).The buffet breakfast has a huge selection of foods.Small shopping mall 2 min away for food/supplies/money changer.Staff were friendly and pleasant.EVERYTHING WAS AWESOME !!",5.0
2054,A lovely outdoor themepark,I visited this theme park this mid year holiday and it's very nice place to go with your kids especially below 15 y.o it's very recommend. Kids are in loved with this place.But mommy very tired and 'being robbed' to buy so many lego.But it's okay some of their lego couldn't be found at the store. All the Facilities are good and very kids friendly Minus : it very hot here. So you must avoid to come in the noon time. ,4.0
2055,"Super fun for young kids, Super HOT, Need more trees and service upgrade","I was there with my kids, 5 and 7 yo, and they think it is soooo awesome. This is their first experience with themepark.  This themepark is really great for kids that age. They enjoy the rollercoster, the driving lesson and driving license ( Why do we have to pay extra for the driving license??), all the lego figures (the wolf and extra tall giraffe are the best), the 4D movie and of course the water park (slides and wave pool). They are already planning to come back.As for my self (an adult), i think the service could be and should be better, especially if compared with the service and attitude of Disneyland. It seems that the staff are not really happy / enjoy it to be there, they are not really keen to answer questions, and smiles were rarely seen in their faces.And the other thing is this park (both theme park and water park) definitely need MORE TREES. it was too hot and super hot. P.s. bring change of clothes if you want to play the rides that involve water. They are fun but wet. and you have to pay to use the body drier (Really Legoland?? I think it would be awesome if you let the guest use the body drier for free)",4.0

My kids (aged 4, 7 and 9) loved the area where they could build and then race their constructions. They loved the ninjago show and the 4d movies. Staff were friendly and helpful. Food was relatively well priced and good options were provided. We will definitely be back!",5.0
2058,Great fun but expensive experience,This is a great day out with a family of young children. If you're coming from Singapore it would be well worth getting a private car company to drive you as the border crossing can be really slow. There is also a Waterpark connected to LEGOLAND which you REALLY need after a hot day at the park. So really not that possible to do in a day trip from Singapore. Everything inside the park is as to be expected. I was pleasantly surprised at the amount of activities there were for young children under 5 too. There was a great variation of outdoor activities like roller coasters mixed with indoor activities to cool down like the 4D movie experience which our whole family loved. Major disappointment was the food which was just terrible. Try and bring as much of your own food as you can. ,4.0

Suggest to buy tickets online which is hassale free. Suggest to go for family package.When we went there, it was raining in first 2 hours and then weather was naturally pleasent. Transporation is not an issue and lot of metered taxies were available. With the help of lego they created dynamic models of historical buildings like great wall of china, mosques, boats etc. You may take lot of pictures. Overall highly recommended.",4.0
2061,Good day out with the family,"We visited Legoland as a family on 1st July, there were 4 adults and 2 children aged 10 & 12 in our group. It was a great day with hardly any crowds which was a bonus. We didn't have to line up for any rides and the kids even stayed on a couple of rides for multiple turns without getting off which they loved. The park has plenty of things to see and do for all ages. My two children were a little bit old for the Lego 'City' section which included driver training and an emergency services experience for the littlies. My kids particularly enjoyed the Technic, Star Wars and Kingdoms sections which kept them well entertained with rides and interactive experiences.The 4D movies were OK, however the seats didn't move and there wasn't much to really consider the experience 4D, however we enjoyed it all the same. Food options were relatively good for the majority of us, however the 2 'dairy free' vegetarians were unable to be catered for so if you have dietary requirements be prepared for this. The shops were well stocked and had lots of great things available for purchase. Prices were reasonably good, however don't expect any heavily discounted Lego or you will be disappointed. Staff in the stores were lovely towards the children and very friendly. Only let down with the stores was that the 'build your own mini figure' station wasn't particularly well stocked which meant children were going up to the counter constantly along for pieces that they were after. The reason I am giving the park a 4 is based purely on location though. We took the day trip over from Singapore to Malaysia which we were told was around a 50 minute drive. This would have been correct, however no one informed us of the delays that occur at customs! It was bad in both directions however particularly bad on the return getting through Singapore immigration. We, along with hundreds if not thousands of others were lined up for 3 hours waiting for the 4 customs officers to process people through. In my opinion this just isn't good enough, particularly when both countries are trying to promote Legoland as a great tourist experience. Whilst this isn't the fault of Legoland itself, something really should be done about this. Departing the park at 6:15pm and not arriving back to our hotel in Singapore until after 11:00pm with 2 children really put a negative feeling into an otherwise great day. Both kids have said to me 'never again'.",4.0
2062,Semi-awesome day,"I went recently with young children (4y and 14m) and the theme park is a lot of fun. It is obviously aimed to 3 maybe 4yr age group but there are rides for younger children that must be accompanied by an adult. There are so many fun things to do and my 4 yr old had a blast exploring all the different activities and rides he had a great day. The only complaint I have is that there is not enough of undercover shaded areas or fans as it gets really really hot. If your kids are from a colder climate bring at least 3L of bottled water, hats and sunscreen and even strollers for them to sit while getting around. There are strollers there to rent but are plastic and I imagine would get sweaty and hot for the children? I had my own luckily, but there was no where to keep cool and we ended up parking my youngest in the cafe so he could sleep comfortably. All the retail shops request to leave strollers outside because I am assuming they do not want a whole truckload of people loitering for the cool air while theirs children sleep! Other than that be well prepared as it is a big day. We came by bus and it really was a horrible experience passing through immigration, especially Singapore. All up it was three hours there and three hours back. The longest was Singapore with up to an hour and a half wait. Be warned with young children as it can turn into a living nightmare. I would recommend staying the night there and enjoying the park. The hotel looked cute and there are upgrades for the water park which we didn't do and maybe should of. If it wasn't for the nightmare of immigration I would of enjoyed it a lot more. ",4.0
2063,Has its good and bads,"There are better parks out there but if your a lego fan i guess its good.the rides are not that exciting,splash was good cause i got soaked and cooled down as its hot.rides seem to close without warning even if you qued for an hour due to weather conditions.my highlight was the star wars exhibition.we had a 2 day pass and alternated between the water park next door to cool off.We walked the park in 5 hrs.TIP.best to go on the arvo as the crowds have dropped off as all the kids are exhausted less waiting time for rides.",3.0

Register you room number at the restaurant, let the kids play for a couple of minutes & before you know it a table will be available. The buffets, both breakfast & dinner are massive & very comprehensive covering a wide variety of cuisines. Dishes are promptly restocked. Rooms were  exactly as promised on hotel website, comfortable & clean with lots of special touches for the children. Staff everywhere in the hotel where very friendly & helpful.Senior discounts available at restaurants & park.",5.0
2065,Good For Younger Children,LEGOLAND is a well laid out park with a good range of ride. We would highly recommend this for younger children but is likely a little tame for teenagers and older. Our 10yo Lego fan thoroughly enjoyed himself. The park was only lightly patronized during our mid week visit so there were negligible queues with repeat access to the rides easily achieved.Don't expect cheap Lego though as it can be bought as cheap in the shops although there were some items that were exclusive to the park or of limited edition.The big negative for the day was the trip to and from Singapore. We travelled by bus which is a 55min journey. This grew to two hours exiting Singapore and blew out to three hours on the return leg. The cause was the queues and delays being processed through Singapore customs. This detracted from the day markedly.,4.0
2066,Fun...interesting hotel ,"We are staying and 3 types of room within 3 nights. And happily and very humble staff provides me 2 nights with upgrade to premium room. They have such a mechanism to provide convenience for the guests to move all the lugage into the new room. So every morning ..we just need to pack and call the receptionist, concierge will help to move all the lugage. Rooms are very fun...kids love it so much. The lego in the room that they provide help kids play silently.. it's really fun. The treasure hunt also make the kids collaborate as a team...help the teamwork. Breakfast area quite crowded. Food ok. Vary of food also ok. Sometimes they have waiter brings pancake with marshmallow, my kids love it.Lobby area are heaven on earth for the kids. They have plenty of lego pool for playing....kids love it.",5.0
2067,Ideal for 5-8 year olds,"Having been to Legoland in Orlando, our expectations were high. Most of the rides were closed at the start due to lightning, and the staff tried to move our children on to other rides when they were happy to wait patiently outside the door. When I asked what rides we should do given that everything was closed, the staff member basically asked us to go away. Thankfully a more helpful (and senior) person overruled him and suggested that the kids wait inside until the ride reopened. The place was clean and very well laid out. Mini land is glorious, with a focus on Asian buildings and you could easily spend a few hours marveling at the models. The rides are mostly geared towards the younger child - my tween did some of the roller coaster rides but Legoland was much more of a hit with the 8 year old. Food options are limited for vegetarians. The Lego in the shops are also more expensive than my usual shop (or the Lego shop online) - so buy a souvenir or two but Lego itself is not any cheaper here. We were lucky that it was a cool morning so we got a lot done when it wasn't too hot - but with limited shade, it's easy for children to overheat and get sunburnt. ",4.0
2068,"Superb family fun, but little shade","If you are acclimatised to Malaysia then be prepared for a great family day out!  The dry side has about 80% of the rides found in Windsor, but there is also a wet park with a good number of slides and a big wave pool to cool off in. During Ramadan queues were fine, but I'd imagine during school holidays this will be different. There are some air-con places in the theatres and as the trees grow there will be more shade.

2077,Bring Plenty of Water and Sun block,Visited the park in April 2016 with young children. Family and Friends group. The kids was excited and have a very good time with the various rides and hands on experiences. There's plenty to do. The park is vast and most areas are not shaded. That's the downside. The heat is amazing. This is a problem for themeparks all across South East Asia. My advise is to pack plenty of water and stay hydrated. Rub as much sun block as possible.  ,3.0
2078,Good for young children and ok for elderly,I took a taxi meter from Jahor city to the logo land. It took 30 mins and costed 50 RM.

2079,Great but less indoor attraction,"We are annual pass holders and hence we have been there more than once. The kids said they are enjoying their stay there but i can hardly see which are the attractions that they really enjoyed. I am not suggesting that the attractions are not fun but my girls aged 4 and 6 might not be able to play all the rides due to age and height limit. Esp for the younger girl, she cant play a lot of rides and when we were there, it is either she cannot play or she scare of dark and dont dare to go inside or  she finds the rides scary. But she still told me she enjoyed legoland and wanted to go back again. Her favourite are driving the car  and the horse riding (i think it is called royal joust). For my elder girl, she can play more rides but she is also afraid of height and challenging rides. She still refuse to play the roller coaster no matter how hard I tried. Eventually she went for dragon appentice after much peer pressure but she did not like it. I think she prefer water park more and more willing to do the attractions there.Overall, it is still good (my kids said they enjoyed it) and in my opinion, it is best situable for kids who are more willing to take challenges and love those rides.",4.0
2080,A Fun Filled visit,"During the recent June holidays, we went to LEGOLAND twice.

2081,Best holiday ever!,Legoland was the highlight of our holiday! We all loved legoland and the kids (5& 2) had a ball!

2088,Not a very big park for kids!! ,"Went with my 3 years old on a tuesday morning when there weren't many vistors. Sometimes it's hard to say if it's good since you don't have to queue for any rides, but it seems a little less fun when there are not many kids screaming/ laughing ard. Nice staff, clean environment, even have lego blocks area for kids in the queueing area. Tickets not expensive, park is not very big. Some of the facilities were under maintenance which was a disappointment. If you don't mind having your kids spending  hour on lego blocks or running ard in the playing areas then its not so bad at all. Lots of shaded sitting area. Food and drinks not expensive. Love the ""photo printed on lego blocks"" (cost RM220). Anyway, I enjoyed it since my son liked it and we had 2 times on most of the rides without 'queueing'^^",4.0
2089,Dont park at hotel carpark,Hotel carpark charge RM50 per entry. Even toddler need to buy ticket at water park. Locker rental RM40 per day. Basically everything are money here. Overall is ok. ,3.0
2090,Enjoyable rides and 3D movies,My pre-schooler son enjoyed the 3D movies after his little frightening experience during a live performance as the theater was darkened suddenly for its effect when he was younger. He enjoyed the junior version of roller-coaster ride as what he saw over the TV advertisement. He was proud to tell our neighbors that he was on the roller- coaster.It is good exploring ground for younger children.,4.0

2092,"Lego very good,but surrounds need improving","After spending an hour at the Singapore border it was only a short 30 min bus drive to LEGOLAND. The saving grace for our family was seeing the STARWARS lego sets and characters from the first 6 movies. The remainder of the displays were very life like and it is a credit to the builders for there patience in constructing the city scapes.The two main roller coaster rides were a little bit disappointing, but the main issue with the whole site is the lack of large shade areas similar to those at Universal Studios in Singapore or Warner Bros on the Gold Coast. The food outets could also improve only in the number of sites. Its on of those places that once you've been you won't need to go back",3.0
2093,Less sunny as trees have grown. Still fun for the kids!,We visited 2 years back and glad to be back as trees have grown! More sheltered places. Rides are still good for the kids. Best for 3 years and above. ,4.0
2094,Amazing park with some shortcomings,"A nice big place for a nice family day out.Plenty of rides and attractions, perfect for kids of all ages, even adults should be able to enjoy.Plenty of stalls to stay out of the heat occasionally.The only bad point is that the car park is very far from the entrance and parking is not sheltered.",4.0
2095,More for children.,"I went with a group of friends (we're all about 21-23) to Legoland as a day trip during the off-peak period so as to avoid the crowds. It is a little bit on the disappointing side for us half-adults (haha) as there aren't any rides that are more exhilarating. It was more of a child's kind of haven. On a side note, please do not ever eat the pasta in the cafe. It is absolutely horrifying, almost like noodles slow-boiled in lukewarm water. Yeuch.",3.0
2096,A bit disappointing.,"Few staffs, long guests queau, crowded. However, we tried to just enjoy oursleves! My nieces had fun in the rides but the boys expected for more exciting and thrilling rides. ",3.0
2097,Full of fun,"Came here on weekday and it was deserted. The rides were fun, especially roller coasters and aquazone wave racers. The build  & test area was very interesting, I wish I can have more time to play there.

2098,Family fun trip,"We were going there with family. This theme park is more suitable for children since there are many attraction for kids instead of for adult. During ramadhan month, there was no queue at all. Every attraction only need about 5 minute for waiting. The grill restaurant is good and value for money. ",5.0
2099,"2nd time, Very Good","Went on Saturday weekend, 2nd visit. Few improvements I have noticed. In open area where miniature legos are built, they have some sort of sprinklers to keep the place cool. A train ride has been started which is good. Mapis clear and various sections are designed to keep you busy for whole day. Since queue were short so we enjoyed some rides twice.Staff is generally helpful and polite, food was ok.",4.0
2100,Great mini version of California,We had the luxury of visiting LL in California in summer 2013 which was a great experience for a then 4yr old. Now based in SG we have visited LL MY 3 times this time we stayed at the hotel and visited one park each day. This made it an all encompassing LL experience which matched the experience in California. Without crowds it is easy to get around the 2 parks in one day. By staying over we got to enjoy multiple sessions on each ride. Thx LL MY!Don't do the drive from SG on a bank holiday weekend.  6hrs V's 1hr,4.0
2101,Perfect Spot for Family Trip,"1. Recommend to purchase online ticket for cheaper price 2. Go for both Water and Theme Park (combo) - If you did, choose the Water Park first (just in case if its raining cos they will close the park) then enjoy the rest of the day in the Theme Park3. Prepared to book 2 lockers both in Water Park and Theme Park that respectively costs RM40/each for medium size lockers 4. Sun screen for the kids are essentials not only because of the walking from one spot to another, but also you tend to be exposed to the sun during most the activities.5. Lots of nearest hotels that costs cheaper than the Legoland Hotel. Just choose the one suits you and your family6. City center will take about 20mins driving to the Legoland if you choose to stay in the downtown hotel.7. Lots of restaurants and food pit stop within the Park so no worries on food supplies",5.0
2102,Prefer Genting rides over Legoland,"Not many options for someone who prefer more adventurous rides, very crowded on weekends. Longer waiting time for each ride. There are artifacts using lego bricks, this is existing for kids not for adults. Yes for kids sake you can visit once.",4.0
2103,There is something for everyone,My second time at Legoland. Everyone of my family has a different need and yet all of us could enjoy our time to our fullest. ,5.0

We are a bit late at 9am and saw a very very very long queue, decided to drop the idea of having breakfast there.Strongly suggest the management to look into the queuing analysis and work method of their staff.Will not return unless improvement seen from public feed back.",1.0
2105,Great for the kids,"If you have kids you need to come to this place. It is a fair drive and a full day but worth it. Our kids still cant stop talking about it and loved the rides and attractions. As I mentioned it is a fair bus travel and customs / immigration can take a while, we were unlucky and it took us over an hour to cross the boarder. From the outside the place looks run down with few cars in the overgrown carpark but inside the facilities are well looked after and offer both dry and wet rides. They accept both Malaysian and Singapore currency but only provide chance in local currency. The queues to the rides were short on the day we went which allowed for the kids to do the rides multiple times‚Ä¶ oh yeah don‚Äôt forget to do the 4D experience",4.0

First day, we planned to explore dry park and second day we planned to get wet at wet park.We had so much fun ride all roller coasters, play games and lots of pictures taken at each theme at dry park.Ensure you wear sport shoes or walking shoes. Don't forget to apply sun block with higher SPF.Second day at wet park, a part from swimming suit, ensure you are wearing jersey material, so that you are able to play at all wet theme.I will visit again and again and worth value for your money to buy open ticket. You are able to enter at both park unlimited time until you collapse due to tiredness.",5.0

2109,"Fun Day, Very Happy.","We visited on a day threatening rain, so we only got the theme park pass on recommendation of staff, not the water park also. It did clear up but we had more than enough to do on the Theme park side.I agree with many reviewers that this is a younger person targeted park - the rides were good for young ones, the Dragon ride was a good roller coaster on the more extreme end (but still very tame) my 7 year old who is scared of these things worked her way onto it happily.We were there on a Monday that was - thankfully - dead quiet. We never waited for any ride and most rides we were allowed to stay on or move to the back for second time around which was really good.We loved it. We'll be back!",5.0
2110,"Wonderful fun, something for everyone","We had a great time at Legoland. As well as great rides there are amazing figurines and mini-cities made from Lego -  so many very clever things.

2117,Great holiday kids,Just went with family members. Location easy to find. Open at 10am and cloe at 7PM and not much crowd during fasting month. All the activity at drypark super. But food too expensive look expect more tourist from out of country. For my opinion we can try once for exposure.,3.0
2118,Legoland Revisited,Annual pass holders since 2012 but back only a few times because of the hassle of getting there. This time we chose to stay the night at the hotel and get up early in the morning. Surprised that there wasn't much crowd on Tuesday and Wednesday. Almost no queues for the rides. I suppose it's a good time to visit.,5.0
2119,Good times,"Just when i thought i had outgrown theme parks, Legoland sure brought back the kid in me. It was very well organised. The park was clean and well maintained. Everything in working order. Although entrance fee is more expensive than Sunway Lagoon, tubes are given out free.",4.0
2120,Family trip,Was a heavy rain day but we did enjoyed ourselves after the rain stopped. Only get to play certain rides as my son is either too young or cannot reach the minimum height. Will advise to bring cap and own water as well as poncho. :)Do try out the 4D motion movie. My FIL who is 60 plus enjoyed it too.,3.0
2121,Family Fun,The GOOD- Project X - roller coaster ride with a good mixture of challenge and fun; not too intense for small kids- Driving School - good experience for kids to read road signs and drive on their own- Dino Island - my kids enjoyed the splash and excitementOther feedback:- Lost Kingdom - the laser gun in the ride I took is not working - Star Wars exhibition - impressive artwork and display of Star Wars locations or battle; gets boring after going through aisles and aisles of displaysOverall I would say going to Legoland is an experience but the size of theme park and the attractions it has are comparatively fewer to other theme parks.  The Water Park beside it offers extended fun for the family once they have gone thru the attractions in Legoland.,4.0
2122,"""Mummy, can we go again to Legoland again?""","These are the words ringing from my 5-year old girl. We bought the 2-day combo ticket (on promo by Legoland Hotel) and we spent first day at the theme park followed by the water park the next day. Friday at theme park was not crowded, reasonable queue time (mostly less than 15 mins). As my kid is abt 110cm, most rides were suitable. Lego Shop was big and worth the shop. Water park was truly enjoyable with most rides suitable for my kid.",5.0

2125,Legoland with Family,"Legoland was fun during our 1st time visit, but now that our kids are in higher primary, it seems like they are alittle out of place and didnt enjoy that much. (other than the project x ride, dragon roller coaster)Waterpark is fun though but to bring the dinhgy up for the water slide can be tiring if you are climbing up. And remember to bring sunblock as you can easily get sunburn even it rains. During our visit it rains sporadically and after back to Hotel my hubby whole body & face was red (sunburn)",3.0
2126,"Very well run, low capacity","This park is a dream. It has tons of rides, both on the theme park side and the waterpark side. Both were at low capacity when we visited, so we got to ride everything several times. Sadly, the waterpark had many rides that were out of service. The on-site food and drink were outstanding, at very low prices.",5.0
2127,Kids Favorite!,"Everything is awesome!  This is the 2nd time we visited Legoland Malaysia.  This time around it was not crowded.  There were no long lines.  The kids loved everything including the roller coaster!  They had new attractions and are still building new ones.  The comfort rooms are also clean and spacious.  I had no difficulty changing my baby's diaper.  They even have a sink for kids!  However, it can get a bit hot on a very sunny day, so bring some umbrella's or caps.  There's a stroller and wheelchair for rent for a minimal fee.  For families with kids, I suggest you rent as it's extremely convenient.  The food choices are not that enticing for kids but good enough for adults.  Also, there's not much price difference with buying Lego toys inside the park and back home in the Philippines.  Overall, it's a must visit for families with kids and for those who are kids at heart!",4.0
2128,Kids Favorite Hangout,We took the plunge of getting the Premium Annual Pass late last year. It was an investment well worth it. My kids love both the parks and having the premium annual pass allows us the flexibility. The park is well maintained and the attractions are always fresh. The staffs are very well trained and courteous. ,4.0

2130,Great Theme Park!,Queues for rides did not take too long and most rides were enjoyable. It can get a bit too hot on a sunny day due to the limited shade. Have been there twice and will go back again when there are new rides added.,4.0
2131,The best 2 Days in my Kids Life,You need to visit for one full day for theme park and another full day for water park. There are plenty of good restaurants and places to rest after long walk. Try to avoid weekend as much as possible and try to go early to avoid crowding. Wear a comfortable shoes and light cloths for high temperature.,5.0
2132,"Great, fun place ",Had a wonderful time at both the theme parks. The waterpark is a great place for people of all ages. There's an attraction to suit anyone's thrill level. The Legoland theme park is a great place to enjoy some fun rides. The displays are really interesting and awesome. ,5.0
2133,Fun day out,My family of five visited Legoland and had an absolute blast. We took a private car from Singapore that only took just over an hour door to door. The park is suited for kids aged 2-13 and they basically call that out on most of the attractions. We have been to most of the parks in Singapore and so this was a natural next adventure. The comparison to Universal studios is only really relevant if you've got teenagers as little kids would have equally as much fun at Legoland. The biggest difference was the price of the food and beverage. Malaysia is just so much cheaper than Singapore!,5.0
2134,Great day out,"We went in an off-peak time with our 9 year old daughter and had a great day. There is a mix or rides and cool lego construction activities and displays. A highlight for us was the Lego Mindstorm activity where you program robots to do tasks. We took the VIP option given it was our daughters birthday, given how quiet the park was on the weekday we went it probably was not worth it but the staff gave us extra attention and we got to have our family added to one of the country displays permanently which was cool. The food was very good at the park (Asian & European), we also sampled the food at the nearby Lego hotel which was also excellent. We were staying in Singapore and took a Malaysian taxi from in Singapore straight to the park which made things easier.",5.0

2136,Good place to visit on weekend but don't expect too much,"I visited Legoland with my family in October. The theme park is simple and can be fun for kids. But I don't recommend for adult or teenage, especially when it's very close to Sentosa - home of the Universal Studio.  Better spend time in the Universal Studio. The place is not well managed. The amusement equipment is in good condition, looks very safe. Just not fascinating enough to be enjoy for adult.",3.0

The rides are Lego themed as well. Lego and Star Wars fans will have a double blast. It was just right that my family bought the 2 day multiple entry tickets with overnight hotel stay. One day would not have been enough.

No long lines for rides.",4.0

2144,Good weekend retreat for kids,"We were lucky that the crowd and weather were both in our favor for this trip. Overcast skies and slight drizzles meant that we did not have to subjected to the intense heat and humidity famous for the region. Queues were also acceptable considering that it was the school hols for SG. I'm guessing most people headed further for the month long holiday. We upgraded our day combo pass to premium annual pass by the end of the day coz our kids had so much fun and we definitely want to come back a couple more times in the next 12 months. Our youngest couldn't really go on a couple of the rides though due to the age/height restrictions but there are still plenty of things for him to do,",4.0
2145,My Family 1st Visit,"Decided to bring my family to experience the Water Park and Legoland on 2 days after putting it off for quite sometime. Very happy to find the Personnel very friendly and welcoming. It will be very unfair to compare Legoland with other theme parks found in Asia and US. By itself, the park should be able to entertain visitors with its Water Slides and Rides. You should be able to complete the 2 parks within a day if you start at opening time and also if weather permits.",4.0
2146,Great place to enjoy ,"This place is totally worth it.we were here with 3 kids.we bought theme park tickets only.the place is very big and make sure you wear a comfortable shoes and backpacks coz easier to move around.for one day trip,I recommend buying theme park tickets only.we didn't have enough time to enjoy all rides.this place is big!",5.0

2152,Great for kids,"My kids absolutely loved it though i very much prefer USS. Weather was good so we managed to enjoy the whole park the first 2 days. Rides are very much catered to the little ones but that's okay as my kids were very happy.Ninjago puppet show was very unique and entertaining. Lego movie was so-so, the racer one is much better. Not as exciting as Shrek in USS but it is a great experience in itself.Water park was also great and the kids enjoyed their time there. We had to cut the day short as it was raining otherwise we would probably have spent the whole day there.Overall...everything is awesome!!",4.0
2153,Give this place a skip if not a LEGO fan,"Our family went there on a weekday during school holidays season in Malaysia and Singapore. We were expecting a big crowd but seems a little quiet than expected. The queue line was not long and manageable. This Legoland is very small but still need at less 6-8 hours to enjoy the park.However, do be prepared for the high humidity there as most of the attractions are outdoor. We were sweating like crazy.The best game inside the park was the Lego Race Car building where kids need to use their creativity to build the fastest race car. I liked it when the staff came out to challenge the kids with her Lego car. Most of the kids enjoyed this and this make them more determined to build their car faster. Legoland should think of more game/activities which challenge kids in using their LEGO building skills, probably to reward them if they won. We were disappointed with the condition of the park, many equipment broke down such as the remote control boat, race car track (left 1 unit functioning).Certain games need to pay additional before they can play and this is a let down. The games offered was not even related to LEGO at all which is quite weird.Otherwise, great place to visit if you are a big Lego fan and give this a skip if you are not into Lego.",3.0
2154,Improvements after grand Opening,"Revisit Legoland on 30/5/2016 due to my son is a Big Lego fan. This time we stayed in Legoland resort which is the happiest moment in his life.

2158,Finally made it to Legoland - less than expected,"While on a trip to Singapore we booked in through WTS Travel a day expedition to Legoland Malaysia as i unfortunately missed out on seeing Legoland in America some time ago!The bus expedition is quite lengthy at the immigration departure point of Singapore, this took about an hour of just waiting there - the entry point of Malaysia was quite hassle free. The bus trip back is all dependent on time we took the 8:30 bus there and the 17:00 back, we had an hour to wait until our 17:00 departure as we'd completed the park in 5 hours and thats with a lengthy break in the restaurant (for the a/c).The park is not overly large, there is an entire middle section under construction due to be Ninjago later in 2016 - however the other themed zones are well done, however it is very catered to children and not so much adults that are letting their inner child out. There is quite a few stores, that sell different things, no real exclusive Legoland items though, but all in all was a good experience just to see the amount of Lego bricks that are just everywhere! A few attractions were either broken/under repair on the day like Boating School, remote controlled boatsMost of all be prepared for the humidity - the sweat will just leak into your eyes and blind you - but the food is overly cheap, and they convert it to SGD if you wish!",3.0
2159,My son loved it!,Very good mix of rides and interactive activities.  Need more shaded areas for the scorching hot weather.  Need to clean the lego statues as they are getting dusty.  Overall a great visit!,4.0
2160,World Class!,"We got the 2-day combo tickets & even then we thought it was not enough! The park is sooo huge, we could barely cover all the attractions! There's really something for everyone! And a lot of seating areas for when you need to take a break. Also, not to worry if your younger children don't meet the height requirement for certain rides (they are very strict about this, which is a good thing!), there will be Lego for them to play with while waiting for their older siblings! We were lucky that when we came, there was a Star Wars parade going on. Apparently, every month there's something different happening so if you live nearby, should really consider getting the annual pass!",5.0
2161,A Beautifully Decorated Fun Park,"Finally get there after eyeing for some time! It's a great experience especially for our young child.The access from the main road to the entrance was not really stroller friendly, as there're no elevator within the complex.Right in front of the entrance we can hire locker... the small one costs 20 RM but it fits my 45 L backpack, and last for 24 H (if you want to keep it). And it seems they're renting strollers for those who didn't bring one.Toilets were...terrible as there're no water hose let alone jet washer and not really clean as they claim.Also photo shoot was a rip off as they charge ridiculously 60 RM for each piece. We didn't take any of that.Having said that, all rides were really fun. I reckon it will take about 6-7 hours to make a full round, including meals, shows, etc.We're lucky the queue was not long, so we can get into the rides real quick. It's also extremely hot down there, but plenty of drink stalls to buy. My suggestion is to drink a lot of mineral water instead of soda.All in all Legoland Malaysia is sure a fun park.

2162,Great fun,"Legoland Malaysia is a very nice theme park, most attractions are well tailored for kids of all ages. Some attractions and displays are a bit old and shabby, but maintenance seems to be ongoing. When we visited, a number of attractions were shut so it may be worth calling beforehand to check. Overall great fun !",4.0
2163,Kids love this place,Check-in the hotel so you can go to both waterpark and theme park. You can almost leave your kids to run around the place. You might need to bring water since it can get really hot. It might be better to bring kids around 4 years old and up since the rides usually has an age and height limit.,4.0
2164,Heaven created for children,"Last May 2016 marked my second visit to Legoland MY with my spouse and 3 years old daughter..The park is clean, staff is friendly, and there are varieties of legos to be shopped n bring back home :)We stayed at the park from 10am till 5pm..Things not to be missed:1. the welcome dance by the staff and crew n also lego mascot2. ninjago 4d show at lego city stage (show start at 1030-11am)there are 2 prayer rooms located at the entrance and at theLand of Adventure.. less crowded at the Land of Adventure..to enjoy MOST of the rides, the acceptable heights is 120cm but small children have numbers of option too..My daughter love Legoland and enjoying her time but a but a bit crancky during nap time so we need to take 5, and sit in one of the aircond restaurant enjoying the pizza..There will be new attraction in Legoland this becoming Dec 2016.. insha Allah.. They said that there will b a Ninjago section that currently under renovation..oh yes, during our visit, boating school was closed for maintenance.. :(",5.0
2165,Theme park for the young,We were lucky as there were not much crowd and the queue move quickly. We went there for the starwars theme but was kinda disappointed that there were not much figuring to buy.Kids enjoyed their ride and went home happy! ,3.0
2166,"Nice place, less queue, best for children","I did enjoy the rides, although they are not much on the extremes so as to cater children I guess. It was a weekend but the queue was manageable. The children loved that there's always a bunch of legos to play with in every place.",5.0
2167,Summer getaway,"Stayed in the hotel with my sister and her children. The hotel was amazing, and it made the experience of going to the theme park even better. We stayed in the pirate themed room, and there was a mini treasure hunt which I really enjoyed, especially with the children.I'm an adult and I probably had just as much fun as the kids (who are all below the age of 10), if not more than them! The rides are amazing, especially the water slides.My trip for summer 2016 to come back is already planned, and I honestly can't wait. Though they're building a Legoland park in Dubai, they're not building the hotel along with it, which I feel is a terrible mistake and is taking half the experience away from it.",5.0
2168,Nice place,Great place for families. Not a big fan of Lego but the water park is worth to try. Would suggest to play the water park first before going to theme park because it'll be closed after rain comes. ,4.0
2169,One time visit,"We visited legoland alongwith my 2.5yr old.kid. he enjoyed most of the rides. We had gone only for the theme.park as my son had cold so skipped the waterpark. If u book.tickets 7days in.advance then you can avail upto 20% discount which is a good deal. Not many rides for the adults though except 1-2 roller coasters. Most of the rides have a height limit of 90cm or 120cms so.if your.kid is less than 90cms then not many rides.for the kid. Good to see the imagination.in viewing characters like dinasaurs, starwars and other animals made if lego blocks. Also one can see some.of the countrys attraction like the taj mahal of india , ankor temple from cambodia made.of.lego blocks. I am myself not a big fan of.lego so would suggest this attraction as a one time visit. One can fing vegetarion burger.option at one.of the food joints near the dino ride in legoland.",4.0

2177,Great rides and attractions for family with kids up to 12 years,Legoland Malaysia is a great 1-day excursion from Singapore with kids between 2-12 years old. Book your tickets online 7 days in advance to get 20% discount or more.How to get there: best by organised bus transfer (20SGD return). The organisation ensures efficient border crossing and you have no hassle with finding the right connection bus or taxi driver waiting 1 day at Legoland.,4.0
2178,kids loved it despite the heat,"Kids loved the activities despite the heat. Maybe they could add more rides because. They can install mists along pathways where it's not really shaded to combat the heat.Glad to see more restaurants inside (although I think they're too many compared to our Aug 2015 trip). Anyway, we're looking forward to the NinjaGo theme rides that will open this Nov 2016.The water park is also a fun place for kids and adults.",4.0
2179,Sweating Hot,Lack of shades/shelters to block the heat along the pathway for the people. Legos are beautifully crafted. My family & I love it very much. The place still needs improvement to have more things to show. Overall it's okay.,3.0
2180,Great place for kids!,"It is a very nice theme park to spend time with your kids. The only concern is that it is really hot. Hoping they could provide more shelter in the future. There are a lot of rides for kids of all ages though there are height limits to be followed. My son was not able to ride all due to height limitation. There are restaurants and snack stores inside to purchase your food. Also, Lego stores are all over so get ready to purchase more and more. After spending time in the theme park, you may transfer to the water park (for a different ticket) to cool down. All in all, this is a very nice place to spend 1 day. It is our 3rd time here and for sure we will be back again.",5.0
2181,Lovely place must visit,"This was our second time to go to Legoland in 6 months last time we could not finish the whole park so we took the other direction to finish first what we couldn't visit first time , it was fun my daughters love it even when it was raining with lightning . actually you can not finish the whole park in one day so you need 2 days for the park and maybe you can add the waterpark too. we will go there again when we are in JB.",4.0

2184,Rain but not washed out!!,"My 2 kids, an adult & a 10 year old started the morning with the Water Park but barely a ride later, we were told that water rides were suspended due to lightning & rain!! Oh oh....and the exciting rides are in the rain!! So we decided to go to the theme park where there were indoor rides ( though the fun adrenaline charged ones are in the rain, so no rides!!) and saw the Star Wars exhibition and also the 4D movie, Chimar  and  checked out the park in the rain! (We planned to go to the theme park the day after) By noon, we saw the fast rides were being tested and by 12.30pm, the rides in both parks were operational! We returned to the Water Park to continue where the kids left earlier and the rain continued but no lightning . So the waterpark  with the rain was twice the fun!!! Staying at the Legoland Hotel nearby was convenient as we could nip in and out of Legoland to dry up & returned ....! We have been to Legoland twice before ( on hot days with huge crowds!!)and we felt fortunate this time that we we able to experience it in the rain and the crowds kept away...!!",4.0
2185,Kids dream come true,"We did enjoy our visit here particularly as it was not busy so there were no line ups!  We loved that we could all go on the rides although our tall 4 year old had to go with an adult on some our 6 year old could do alone. The park is clean and pretty affordable for a branded type experience.We liked that park entry meant access to all the rides with no extra fees (apart from buying photos of yourself in the rides).We loved dino island and did it several times. ... because it was so quiet, we just went round and round! The star wars exhibit was truly wonderful and we went back twice. I really liked mini land as well as the build and test centre.  Personally i would have liked more guided building workshops or presentations for the 5+ age group over rides.The playgrounds were amazing and our pair loved the kingdom fort. 2 full days was more than enough. In fact one day would have suited me.  If it was very busy i don't think i would have thought it worth it. ",4.0
2186,No queues and helpful staff,Whilst the place is undergoing some rebuilding work which will only enhance the experience of visitors (in my opinion).  Can recommend the food at the grill bar - delicious!  Definitely worth visiting even from our hotel in Singapore.  Great fun on all the rides.  We were lucky there were no queues on the weekday we went on.  Don't have to pay for lockers like you did at Universal Studios in Singapore.  This venue is suitable for families and adults without!,5.0
2187,So hot...,"We went early- as they opened, and it was already so unbearably hot.The displays are amazing, and very detailed, but as it's out in full sun, I rushed through it.I didn't go on any rides- not my thing.The park seemed very empty.  Possibly because it was mid week?The lego shop was cool - but the prices were equivalent to Australia.One cool thing is, the employees have lego men on their name tags, that you can swap if you bring a lego man... but there was one employee who made a rude comment about it/me as I walked away, which unfortunately my malaysian partner understood, which put a dampner on the day.We left after a couple of hours, as the heat was beyond tolerable, and there is not enough shade.

2188,Meant for kids,This place is meant for those who wish to go back to their childhood days. Seems more appropriate for children.,3.0
2189,Excellent Day Out ,"Having been to legoland in the UK a number of years ago I was excited to take my young child with our family for a day trip to legoland. The ticket prices are very reasonable and there is 2 parks but I suspect you would want 2 days to go to the water park and the theme park as it is a very large park.The water park looks magnificent and certainly would be cooling in the hot and humid Malay climate, we didn't go yet so can't comment further.The main park has a wide range of activities for our 2 year old and plenty for kids up to probably 12 so we can go back and try more things next time.I love it how the rides are kids safe they can ride boats and cars themselves without worry, the staff are very friendly and helpful all the way through the park.A couple of roller coasters and water slide for slightly older or braver kids (which I enjoyed too)The classic lego displays of the regional landmarks is superb with very accurate details,  like Singapore  which I am more familiar with.To top it off the Star Wars exhibit which is temporary was very good and a real treat to go at the time this was on show; these displays were 5 star.",4.0
2190,Excellent family day out!!!,"Took the Wts bus from Singapore with wife, and 2 kids...4 year and one year old.Wts bus and service was very good. No problems going but delayed at Singapore customs on way home.Booked park and water park tickets ...would highly recommend as we enjoyed cooling off in the waterpark mid afternoon.Lots and lots to do. All staff at the park were very friendly and helpful.Food in cafeteria was fine and good value.Enjoyed the ninjango play, plus it was an air conditioned theatre!4 year old was just over 100cm and this was important as it opened more rides.As people have said, it is hot, so take all the necessary precautions, cream, hats, water etc!Park was very quiet which was great so no queues. We went on a Thursday though I understand it gets busier in weekend.Great day out, would go again!",5.0
2191,Nice but pricey,"Have been to this place once. Lot's of interesting miniatures are made with Legos. Really enjoyed it. However, the weather was too hot and the water park was not complete yet. Interestingly, they charged for it and never informed us. Enjoyed my first ever 4D experience. That was the best thing to do there. I saw 2 times with 2 different movies.. Overall, once in a lifetime is okay. But, not worth a second visit and spend a huge amount of money....",3.0
2192,"If you have boys, they will enjoy the technic workshop and younger kids enjoy the ride","Why go to Malaysia while in Singapore? Because it‚Äôs one hour and a half ride to Malaysia and it takes about 15-20 minutes to pass both the immigrations.  You will need a Malaysian visa for this, but you can get one on arrival. The Legoland Malaysia is located in Johar Bahru. There is nothing to do in Johar Bahru except Legoland and the Premium Outlet Mall so go there while you are in Singapore. It takes the whole day to cover Legoland. I recommend the technic workshop as the best thing to keep little minds interested, it was my favourite thing to do.  The dragon roller coaster is the best ride over there. The miniatures of cities and world famous monuments were really lovely to see.There is a  Premium Outlet Mall good half an hour drive away. The premium outlet mall has brands like Prada, Gucci, Michael Kors, Coach etc at 50% discount and more. These are genuine products and you can get a good deal.",4.0
2193,water park is your answer to the tropical heat,"There are 2 parts to this attraction. Legoland itself, and the water park. Since we intended to spend half a day there only, we went for the water park. For obvious reasons, because we're trying to escape the heat wave.Only 2 slides were down for maintenance so the rest were quite fun. Logistics wise, it could be improved by supplying more floats so the people waiting at the bottom of the slide will be happier. Good thing is how the collection point for slides are at the same spot so you don't get lost or miss out any rides.There are areas for adults and kids, so if you're going as a couple without children, you can skip the safari and playground and head straight for the build-a-raft river. It's really a lazy river with floats and life jackets for you to enjoy the circular journey around the park. The one thing that is fun is that you can pick up foam blocks and really build a raft with the Lego pieces, as I've seen some children do.They're literally living like royalty in their Lego thrones floating along the river.Great place to escape from the heat. Waiting time is reasonable even during a long weekend holiday. ",4.0
2194,Hot!,"Went on the easter holiday so the place was packed (according to the people that worked there) ..we got the vip tour which cost around US$600 or 700 more ontop of the park entrance fee for 3 adults and 2 kids. Overall, i personally think its was worth it as our whole family got to make a lego family  to place anywhere in the park to display, which was different from the other vip tours in Disneyland and universal studios. It also included lunch, tour and unlimited fast pass to all the rides (no queuing, you just go to the exit of the rides and flash the card they give you) The 4D shows were good and definately more appropriate for my 6 yr old compared to universal studios. Kids got to go on all the rides and some rides like the sailing school and driving school, they went on 3 times. Overall an enjoyable stay and would consider going again, but definately will not stay in the hotel again! Also, remember to wear a hat if possible as sometimes keeping hydrated is just not enough! Our nanny got heatstroke playing on the rides and spent 2 hours in the hospital on an IV drip.",4.0

2197,Probably more for younger children,"We went to Legoland for a Day trip from Singapore.  And I would not suggest that it is worth it, unless you are really into Lego.Our kids are 9 and 8 and they found the rides more suited to younger people.  After doing all the rides at Universal Studios, the rollercoasters at Legoland are average.  Don't get me wrong, the rides are OK, but it does not take long to have done all the rides a couple of times, and then you still have half the day to fill in.The highlight of the day for our kids was the big lego store.  That was impressive!One aspect that was most striking for us was the lack of people in the park.  It was the quietest theme we have ever been too.  When the bus pulled up, there were 2 cars in this massive car park.Due to the lack of other customers, the service we received during our visit was brilliant.  They were only to accommodating to assist with any request.  If thinking about taking the tour from Singapore, bear in mind that you have four border crosses to make.  To their credit, the border services going in and out of Malaysia were brilliant.  Singapore, less so.  Nearly 90 minutes for our bus to get back into Singapore.  Mainly due to an old security guard that could not organise a **** up in a brewery and an over officious border officer who took ages on each passport and even wanted the kids fingerprinted.  His crap service did put a dampener on the day for us.That said, the effort to get their and back is probably not worth it given the themepark.  But I would also say, that we did not go into the Waterpark.  Maybe that would make the experience better?",3.0

2199,Very impressed with the lifeguards,"I'm an annual pass holder and often go to Legoland (or LL as we call it at home for fear of the little ones hearing it). This is my umpteenth visit. On many previous visits to the water park I often wonder if these lifeguards were actually of any use. Coz u know, we never see them in action and some of them seem rather portly and dont seem very capable of saving lives. However on this visit to the water park some time last month on a friday evening (wavepool is open til 9pm) I saw 1st hand the lifeguards at work. And boy was I impressed! I didnt even know a kid not too far from me (about 10 ft away?) was in need of assistance when suddenly i heard a commotion / splash from the back of me. I turned and saw the lifeguard already with the struggling kid. This portly chap sprung to action faster than china tourists at a buffet!!! Shortly after another kid had a problem... his nose was bleeding... within 5 minutes I saw an in house paramedic type person looking for the kid. Kudos for the quick response!",5.0

If you go, you will be going purely for the parks but so worth it!",5.0
2201,Lovely experience for kids ,We visited Legoland with my 2 1/2 year old daughter and my sisters kids 3 and 5. I also had my 5 month old baby but it was too hot for her in the morning so my husband took her back to the hotel. We bought a one day combo pass and went to the water park first. It was very warm but the water was welcoming. Only thing is that my two year old was a little two small to fully enjoy the rides. We had a good time but the place is not as large as we thought it was looking at the pictures on their site. Legoland it self was nice but we couldn't really cover the entire park. If we had managed our time better though we could have easily covered the entire park in a day. You should look at the map and have an idea of the various segments in the park so you know which areas to move to as you go along. The cafes inside the park were nice though a little pricy. Each cafe had a small play area for kids to play with Lego and this kept the kids going while we had lunch. All in all it was a nice experience and my two years old is still talking about going to Legoland. ,4.0

2205,Perfect for 6 year old,I have visited twice. Once with a 4 year old and once at 6. Legoland is perfect for 6 year olds; he is the right height for most of the rides and really in love with lego. The rides here are mostly suited to the under  10 age group with probably not a lot to keep serious thrill seekers occupied but for little lego fans its perfect. Stay at the legoland hotel so you can go back to your room for a cool off when the park gets too hot!  Crowd levels were not bad at all during our visit. Loved it!,5.0
2206,Good for young kids under 7,"Pros:- a good place for kids under 7 years old- the park is clean and not too big for young kids- the park has educational purpose facilities. For example theres facility where young kids can built their own lego car and compete with others, and there's also facility where young kids can learn about robotic lego.- there's a water park section that you can access with another ticket purchase- great details on park and miniatures with lego decoration- a big lego store for collector- a big playground areas for young kids to playCons:- the price is a bit expensive - small park that you can easily finish for half day.- not suitable for teens and adults because there are not many rides you can go except uf you're are really a lego fans.- no clown, or anyone who dress up like lego (like disney style theme park where people dress like mickey and other disney charcters so people can photo with them). - The surrounding just feel flat. I dont hear many background music at all. Its like you're walking on very quiete theme park.",3.0
2207,"Can we go here, again?","I was with my 2 kids, 8 and 9 yrs old, and took a 2 days package along with the hotel. Worth every cent, even for me as an adult (or am I a childish one?). The games and rides are available for every ages, but I think the optimal visit is if your kids are more than 100 cm of height. That way, they can enter all rides with adult supervision.The parks is clean, the lego detail surprises are everywhere, and just a short queue despite it's weekend, also the staffs are friendly but still ensuring your kids safety. The restaurant foods with different food themes, are all kids friendly and quite delicious. And I notice that this park has a balance indoor outdoor activities to ensure that even though it's raining, you still got something to do. We were also lucky that we came during the star wars lego exhibition. The only so-so is the 4D movies. Universal studio 4D is still way better.The second day, we visited the waterpark which is not too big, but were having fun with different slides, or even just building lego boat. The wave pool played some cool musics and lego character mini-show at interval times.Before visit, ensure you check its website to learn the opening hours, maintenance schedule, events, etc. The website is pretty detail, very helpful especially if you are not local tourists. And even though it's sunny, better to prepare an umbrella, or better more, a raincoat. Raincoat can also be used to keep your dry at water splashin' rides.To sum it up, I'm quoting my kids when we left to the airport: ""Can we go here again, next year?""",5.0

2216,Legoland was great; the water park not so much ,"We have visited Legoland multiple times but the water park for the first time. As our kids are now older, they were able to take more rides at the dry theme park. We were surprised that the queue wasn't that bad even though it was the Labour Day long weekend. The kids really had fun with all the rides and attractions. They especially loved Beetle Bounce and the driving school. We actually visited the park twice over the course of two days!We had heard rave reviews of the water park so we bought the premium pass this time. We were quite disappointed cos the facilities were old and the number of attractions rather limited. Example, some the tiles at the bottom of the lego lazy river were broken and I cut myself while moving along it with my kiddos. Plus the lego blocks in the water and the life vests were also old and mouldy. The kids were looking forward to the wave pool but on the day we were there, it wasn't on? It became a sort of wading pool. There was a downpour after about an hour there so we left. Was rather disappointing. ",4.0

So much fun.-Legoland pretty good.-Dinner at legoland hotel was exceptionally good for a buffet. And this comes from a food snob. Breakfast not so much.-Worth staying in hotel even though they have to get their act together on some things (check in was a drag, always takes far longer than it should, they couldn't pull off early check in, some front desk people need training in basic customer service while others were outstanding.)-Enjoyed trading minifigures, very friendly staff within the park made it really fun.Cons and lessons-The pricing structure is confusing, even for the people selling the tickets. If you stay at the hotel you apparently get cheaper rates buying through them then at the gates. They literally make you walk back to the hotel to do that. why? Learn from our mistake, buy the tickets at the hotel or in advance. -If you are there for 2 days to celebrate children's birthdays don't bother with the free tickets- a 2 day pass through the hotel is the same price as buying a ticket at the gate for one day and then getting the birthday free pass. Only perk of the latter is a duplo 'gift' and the button you can wear around the park. Which I would guess you could get anyway. -Do waterpark in the morning if there is rain on the horizon- they close the park if there is thunder, which most often happens in afternoon.",4.0
2220,Fun theme park for everyone !,Get free tickets from my friend and decided to have a short trip with my wife . Drive there from Melacca and took 3 hours to arrived . Not hard to find their location actually but still need a minute to find there theme park car park at the back. Have to walk couples of minute from the car park to the theme park . There is few shop lot within the compound to eat and shop ! Not much water games in waterpark but a lot of funs in the theme park. Will come again for my short visit in near future.,5.0
2221,fun in every corner,"We were having fun in every attraction at theme park. Especially we were there when ""Star Wars"" day. All of characters, sounds and atmosphere make our kids so enthusiastic. The water park also great. Overall, we have fun. Two days was not enough for kids, so many things to do.",4.0
2222,Not as Fun as We Expected,"Our day trip to Legoland from Singapore was quite a disappointment, considering that our kids were looking forward to their first trip to Legoland Malaysia. Immigration procedures to cross the border were quite a hassle, but we were willing to push through with the trip in anticipation of the fun we would be experiencing in this well-known theme park.Since we went on a weekday, we were fortunate there were no queues to the attractions.  However, several of the main attractions were closed for repair.  Considering that there were only relatively few rides that were appropriate for our young teens (others were for younger children), at least three of these rides were closed to the public. The park facilities were also not as well-maintained as we expected, and there were no scheduled shows nor a parade that our kids would have enjoyed.  It was a so-so theme park experience which on hindsight, we would have rather spent a day in the Singapore Zoo or Jurong Bird Park as alternative tourist activities for our family.  The trip (including the 1-2 hour bus ride + immigration procedures) was not really worth it, unless you're a die-hard Lego fan :)",3.0
2223,Great place with sooo many things to do!,"it was weekday when we went there so there was no queue at all. so every attraction can be enjoyed smoothly. my children loved them so much! it is worthed to be visited even you must face the heat all day! don't forget to pose for photoshoot at stream dino island, just put your nicest face even it is scary",5.0
2224,Ideal for Kids,"Come here from Kuala Lumpur rather than from Singapore, hassle in immigration will reduce your time in Legoland by 4-5hrs. Very very hot too, so do not forget to bring lots of water, but we liked the rides, not so frightening like in Universal Studios. Really just for kids and for fans of lego. will probably come back when we have kids.",3.0
2225,Kid's fave place,"We love this theme park since it's not to much crowd, maybe becuse we went at the right time where not too much people gathered, my fave spot was the star wars section. ",5.0
2226,Fantastic!! Lego Heaven,"We traveled from KL by the Causeway Link Bus which left at 7.00a.m. After a 4hour journey we reached Legoland. It was breathtaking. You see everything in detail and its made up of lego, million pieces of lego!!! The structures made of lego are far better than the original attractions, and maybe the only time you get to see them. There are camera-men roaming about and will help you out with a picture or two. Overall, the place is suitable for kids, but adults too could enjoy as its very unique. If you purchase the tickets online, you can directly walk into Legoland as the printout acts as the ticket. The roller coaster rides are fun, there are so many things to look around while you walk. If you are hungry, there are many food outlets serving variety from traditional Malaysian food to fast-food.You can also try out your luck at various games to win prizes (soft toys of different sizes). The theme-park it self will require a good 3-4 hours. The water-park is adjoining the theme-park, which we couldn't experience due to our time concern as the bus back to KL left at 6.30p.m.When using the rides, there are racks available to store your bags. The 4D Movies were fun as well. A comment has to be made on the washrooms, as stated they were the cleanliest in the area.",5.0
2227,Great Family Theme Park,"Great for family outing park, the kids like it!  However, if you plan to visit both wet and dry park, it is good to be there early as a lot people visitor like the wet park, I believe due to Malaysia's weather!Prepare to have lots of walking and sweat due to the weather! ",4.0
2228,waterpark best and clean and hygienic,i have been to very many waterpark but this is the most organised clean and hygienic water park i have ever seen.al all place there is guard posted for your safety.every staff is well trained and well behaved.lazy river is the best.the pool is good and cold water of the water attraction is refreshing.in the after noon there is a break for 30 minutes for cleaning the water.,4.0
2229,Good to visit,"Me and girlfriend visited during the non-peak season (just before the may Day long weekend) and it was virtually empty.The main attraction is the Lego figurines of famous attractions around the world. Done very nicely. There were some rides and shows but most if not all of them are catered for kids. So do not expect those really thrilling rides. But that said, its good to go with family with kids, to enjoy the rides and the lego. There's also plenty of shops selling lego products and merchandise and even  have personalized lego bricks and keychains (photos taken during the ride.There's also game stalls along the way! Need to pay though. But since we went on a non-crowded day, the staff were very helpful to teach us how to play properly to get the prize. Their locker system is very advanced too with touchscreens and passwords.There is also a separate water park nearby! There's the wave pool, lazy pool and the slides.  Good for family with kids too to enjoy the water, with more thrilling slides available.Outside the theme parks though, there's only a few shops and the hotel nearby.",4.0
2230,So much to do so little time..,"I purchased a combo ticket but visiting it for 2 days would be better. Although the wet park is small, it is so much fun that my 3 and 6 years old children didnt want to leave. We spent half a day there and didnt have enough time to cover the dry park. Was disappointed in that but on the bright side, I will be visiting there again!! Yeay!!",4.0
2231,Disappointing day out with not a lot to do - nowhere near as good as Universal Studios,"It was a scorching hot day and there is very little cover in the park, which is unusual for Malaysia which generally has at least covered walkways.  You needed a ""payung"" to keep the sun off.First the car park - a wasteland with no shuttle bus to the park.  And to add insult to injury it wasn't free, but costs 10RM.  There only seems to be one ticket machine (the usual problem in this country with the machine not accepting your notes until you have ironed them flat), so OK when there is no crowd, but hopeless otherwise, though there are probably other machines in the park itself.  The car park is not a good advert for the attraction.The kids enjoyed the Driving School which I would also have loved when I was a youngster.  The Boating School was OK, but a bit of a lacklustre trip around a fixed path.The log flume was as good as log flumes go, but only one drop instead of quite a few at other parks.The live studio was well done, with the Lego figures worked by guys and girls in black outfits.The 4D cinema was a disappointment as it showed a not very exciting car race, there was a bit of freezing water sprayed over you, but the seats didn't move at all, so it was nowhere near as good as a true 4D simulator.The Lego park with some really good models - Ankor Wat especially - was well done, but in the scorching heat the Asians in our party sat in the shade complaining, with only the ""mat salehs"" being able to stand the heat...By this time the noise from the girls about the heat defeated us after around 5 hours and we had done around half the park.All-in-all not very good attractions even for Lego enthusiasts and a disappointment all round for the hefty admission price for 5 adults and 2 kids.  Won't go again.",3.0
2232,Worth a visit.,"Eventhough it was my first time in Legoland Malaysia, I can't help but to feel a bit nostalgic. It is such a nice theme park that you just can't help but to want to be a kid again.We celebrated my younger sister's 9th birthday here, and as a 19 year old, I just hoped I was a bit younger. Hahaha. Nevertheless, there are quite a lot rides that you can enjoy. I had to skip it though for it has been scorching hot the whole day so instead, I opted for the indoor and airconditioned amenities of the park.Tips: 1. Please bring small bags that you're comfortable to carry around. The locker rentals are just too expensive RM20 for the small ones, and a whopping RM40 for the large lockers for the whole day. 2. Bring umbrellas! It is really hot around the park. Also, the staffs said that it always rain in the afternoon, and it was proven when we went.",4.0
2233,Getting to LEGOLAND Malaysia from Singapore,"We recently enjoyed a smooth, enjoyable day visiting LEGOLAND Malaysia from our Singapore accomodation. We have a child with autism so I am always mindful in making plans to investigate all the options and then decide on the one that I feel will cause the least distress.This is exactly what I did before finally deciding to book David Chai from Translimo Services on the day set aside for LEGOLAND. David was easily contactable by email (reserve@translimo.com.sg) and prompt and professional in all correspondence.David arrived at the pre-organised time at our hotel. It was quite a relief to sit in a new, clean car and not have to worry about directions etc. Most of all, it was a relief not having to have to worry about crossing the border into Malaysia. David took care of it all and it was a stress free, smooth process. David dropped us at the gate of LEGOLAND, we enjoyed the day and got picked up upon us giving him a quick ring and telling him we were ready. Driving back to Singapore was much the same....smooth and stress free. David was a lovely guy with good English skills and good to chat with, happy to answer questions etc.Thoroughly recommend him. To be honest I think the fee was quite reasonable. It probably cost us a little more per head than catching the public transport from the Singapore Flier but given the comfort and smoothness of it all (especially considering the complexity of crossing the border with passports etc), it was a small extra price to pay.LEGOLAND was very cool so a great day had by our family.",5.0
2234,It rain,"Went with my husband, sister, 5 year old girl and 15 months old boy. Have to say the girl had the time of her life. All the rides and activities are enjoyable and they have age specific activities so the little kids have a lot of things to do too. Great facilities for families with young children. The family restroom are big. We rented the double stroller (highly recommended) because it has all the space for your drinks, snacks, umbrella, etc (and obviously for your kids)Wear lots of sunblock, wear ur hats & glasses and bring ur umbrella. It was very sunny at 10am when we arrived and it rained heavily at 3pm for about 2 hours. There are many covered areas (restaurants, lego academy, build and test) you just need to know where is the nearest one in case of rain or when the little ones get too cranky because its too hot. The park map is your best friend during your visit!Food is a little pricey for my malaysian ringgit wallet, but the serving is big. With young kids, i would recommend for you to spend one whole day here.",5.0
2235,Too Expensive,Its a nice place to visit but  little expensive . We tried for hotel booking also but rates keep on changing everyday . Finally we went to Theme park and waterpark for 2 day package . on-line and counter rates are same for 2 days pkg.If u are passing Malaysia to Singapore then its ok to do in one day .,3.0
2236,Fun and fast getaway from Singapore + tips for 1st timers ,"This was our first time to Legoland Malaysia, my husband and I and our six year old daughter. We left 8 am from Singapore in a private car rental and arrived early, 9 am. The park was surprisingly not crowded throughout the day, a Sunday of a three day weekend. We were impressed with the size of the park and variety of rides and activities, including the new Star Wars exhibit which was fantastic. Tips and highlights as follows:-Better to arrive early. Park opens 10am and we walked onto   many rides in the first hour.-The hotel has a wonderful lobby if you do arrive early and need   a place for kids to hang out with loads of Legos and a nice  play space.-Buy tickets a week in advance and get 20% off the cost- The park itself has plenty to offer for a full day. We didn't even make it to the Water Park even though we had tickets.-The rides in the park were great for 4-7 year olds. Many were very mild and appropriate for littler ones.-There are several air-conditioned areas to cool off when you need to and plenty of shaded areas, as well.-The Ninjao live show was fantastic (ages 6 and up, I am conservative in this regard). Highly recommend.-They say no food is allowed but they barely checked our bags. We brought some snacks in Ziploc and water.-The lockers are only 30 RM for the day and well worth it.-We didn't need strollers but the rentals looked great and many with young kids used them.-There are many eateries...a bit pricey but for all tastes.-The water park is right next to Legoland and had lots of slides, maybe more appeal for older children.-Restrooms were clean and well located.Overall, we had a fabulous time, a wonderful memory for my daughter who loves her Legos!",5.0

2239,Check the weather forecast and then go there,We visited Legoland yesterdayKids were all excited and so were we adults We had a great first half enjoying the park but post 15.00 things changed. The sky was cloudy and it got worse as it started raining. The park virtually shut down almost all of the rides. With very little options to look for in terms of indoor activities it was an almost waste of our time.The park did the right thing in interest of the guests safety but my only ask is that in their next upgrade they should look for a larger indoor park. Up until then I strongly recommend to all who wish to get here that you check out the weather forecast and then plan your trip here.,3.0
2240,Everything is awesome,"Fantastic theme park with lots of rides aimed at mainly younger kids. Ours are 8 and 11 and loved it. We went on a Monday in April and it was very hot. There are areas out of the heat and times to sit watching a 4D movie which allows you to cool off but the best part is there are no crowds. We were on rides with a maximum of a 5 min wait and most had no wait at all. If you are too hot, go on Dino Island, get soaked and then you'll  keep cool for a while!!Miniland is great to look at and there is a lot of great Lego displays around the park to check out. The staff at the park are all very friendly and happy and make the day awesome. The food is usual theme park fare all at a reasonable price. I wish they did a photo pass for ride photos and you could get them all on usb or disc as individually these are a bit of a rip off. Be prepared for the heat and you'll have an awesome day ..... Just aim for a week day!!",5.0

2242,The best day of my life!,"Legoland is amazing for young kids from 4-11. The kids loved it. My son said it might have been the best day of his life ever! I recommend the water park, as it has some younger kids attractions as well as massive slides. Don't go over 40 degrees. It is just way to hot. There are shelters with spouts that shoot cold mist. Pack lots of water. You will need it. Not much for teens of 12- 16. Very long que to wait for, I suggest book tickets online. Other than that a great experience for the family.",5.0
2243,Fun for Everyone,"It was a quite day on the day we visited the park. There were no lineups.  If you love Lego, you will love the park.  There are rides to please everyone.  Recommend buying you tickets online ahead of time.  Well worth the savings.  Getting there can be a little difficult and expensive if going by taxi, so try to stay close to the Park. Unfortunately we didn't make it to the waterpark so can't comment on it.",4.0
2244,Must visit if your kid is fan of Lego,"We have been to Disneyland, Univrsal Studios and many other theme parks, but we and our kid have enjoyed Legoland more than any other parks. We stayed at Legoland Hotel for 3 nights. So we could make maximum use of our two-days visit to Legoland with our own pace. Since it was not school holiday period, there were less crowd which enabled us to visit almost all the rides. Our son is 6 year old and he was eligible to enter most of the rides. Unlike his visits to other parks, he did take interest to get into as many rides as possible. There were a number of open play zones. Our kid loved the driving school the most and the idea of awarding driving license was cute. Since we stayed in the hotel, we could purchase 2-day combo (both park) tickets for RM225 (child RM180) which I believe is same price for 1 day at park gate. The water park was more entertaining though lightining strike cut our time short.This, I must confess, the most meorable theme park visit for me, my wife and my son. We all are fond of lego. That makes it a bit more special. People generally make a day-drip to legoland. But I will suggest to stay at Legoland hotel for at least a night (which is an experience in itself) and visit the park for two days, if time permits. We look forward to visit other legoland parks around the world.",5.0

2247,Amazing Day for the kids and us!,"We came on a Friday and purchased our tickets online, i suggest you do to avoid the que! Further, if you purchase in advance you get a discount, so its worth it.

2252,Great place to visit,Visited late April.  The park was very quiet with no queues at all and we could go on the ridesMultiple times if we wished.  The park was 95% operational with only 1 ride (log ride) closed for repairs.  The park was excellent and we all had a great time.  We ate at the park and we were happy with the food and felt it to be of good value.  We would come again (in fact we bumped into some other Australian people who were I a return visit).  I would recommend this park for young children but not for teenagers.  My children especially liked the water park.  ,5.0

2258,Lacking In Atmosphere & Energy,"The entire park (water park & theme park) lacks shade. So on a hot day, or past noon generally, it's not very comfortable walking around. The pavement at The Waterpark becomes scorching hot, so you better have your footwear handy moving from one attraction to the next, otherwise you risk ""roasting your feet""! Attendants at the Theme park lack energy when making announcement for rides (if applicable). We were there on a Friday and the Theme Park closed at 7pm - thought that was kind of early. Even then, by 645pm most of the rides stopped operating and restaurants and cafes inside the park have already closed! One would think the retail shop at the Park's entrance would be open for slightly longer after park close to allow patrons to grab some souvenirs before leaving the grounds. By the time we got to entrance area at 7pm, ALL the shops are closed and security personnel were seen hurriedly getting people out. Been to many theme parks and tourist attractions around the world, and this experience at Legoland Malaysia is by far one of the most disappointing.",3.0
2259,"No crowds, and plenty to do!","I went to Legoland with my 6 year old and family friends.  We came from Singapore on an organised tour which took all the fuss out of transfers etc.  Legoland itself was great, lots to do for the older kids (5&6).  We found that the 2 year old wasn't able to go on many of the rides, but I guess that's to be expected.  The rides were great, my son had a ball.  We did get very wet on the dinosaur drop ride, saturated in fact.We found legoland to be clean and well run.  The lack of lines was just awsome, especially as it was so warm.  We didn't get a chance to visit the waterpark but we heard it was good.Tips- we used a tour organised in Australia.  We were picked up from the hotel at 8am and taken to a depot where we waited about an hour.  There were multiple buses leaving but we were on the last one. We would have liked to have been on an earlier bus as we just wasted valuable time.Don't forget your passports if you are coming from Singapore - getting on and off the bu is a bit of a hassle, travel light if you can to make this easier as everything has to come off the bus on the way it and out.There are lego shops in each area, not all of this specialized lego is in the main shop so if you see something you really want buy it in the lego area.",5.0

Buy your tickets a week early online for 20% off.That also meant that all the Qs were 5 min- awesome! Rides for adults were not very thrilling. I enjoyed the Emmet robot programming workshop the best! Fell asleep during the Spellbreaker 4D movie. Miniature town looks very dated. No shelter between rides so pack a brolly or raincoat. The brollies go for RM80 at the store! Food- you can't leave the park once you enter so eat at the mall first.

This place is very spacious and open space , so you have to prepare hat or sunglass or use a sunblock and plenty to drink to avoid dehydration. yess we went there when the weather is extremely hot. but still have fun.But unfortunately, we cant get good food there.. they should be concerned about the food , because there is no food from outside may be brought in, so they should pay more attention to these things , so visitors will not be disappointed even with having to buy at a price that is high enough.",5.0
2274,Something for everyone,"This Lego park is at the same time for kids from small to teenagers and also for adults who go back to childhood. The Star wars pavilion is amazing and also the monument and city reproductions in lego bricks (Taj Mahal, Wat arun, Singapore and Kuala Lumpur airport,....)Even if we visited on week end no queue at all at the attractions. Going on the afternoon to the waterpark to cool down and relax due to the very high temperature we had on mid April was fantastic. Do not hesitate to buy combo tickets to have access to both parks.Negative point: Food is terrible whatever the restaurants or stands. If you have combo tickets maybe better going out of the park to a small mall with some restaurants. Not tested.",4.0

2276,Everything is awesome!,"Fabulous day full of new and exciting adventures. We were stayed at Legoland hotel, so the theme park went hand in hand for us. Little kids loved the little kids rides and big kids loved the bigger rides. We had a bit of rain on the day, but it was no trouble in fact it was quite pleasant. We purchased the double pass for entry into legoland and the water themepark. Fantastic day.",5.0
2277,Not as big as the Danish Legoland but good enough!,We had a great time at legoland. Not a big park but just nice for us who came with a 4 year old and a baby. A big treat for the 4yr old and the parents of course. Easy to get to by coach or uber when in Johor city centre. Outside of legoland there are several food outlets so we could get our dinner just after our day trip.,4.0
2278,Too much fun,We brought our 5 and 9 yo girls there and spent the whole day there from 10am to 6pm and it was still far from enough. We didn't plan to spend so much time in one place! We bought the combo tickets for both the Legoland theme park and the water park. But the theme park itself would need at least one day! The girls had so much fun and we as adults too. The best thing about the theme park is that it has plenty of air-conditioned places so that we can stay out of the heat for the majority of the time. Once we got inside the park we marked on the map where the air-conditioned places were and just visited accordingly. Of course there were plenty of outdoor places that the girls couldn't resist. Almost everything we walked by were very interesting and had attractive activities. We weren't even half way through the theme park before we had to head to the water park at 3pm. The staff there were extremely nice. Very accommodating and very helpful. The Market Restaurant in the theme park was our favourite place to eat. We enjoyed our lunch there and even went back for dinner after a 2-hour work-out in water park later. The water park doesn't need so much time .... or to be more honest we didn't spend so much time in the water park only because we didn't have enough time and energy...We'll have to come back again...and again...,5.0
2279,Water Park,We hired a cabana at the water parks which is reasonably priced and you get free drinks and towels included in the price. Our 2.5 yr old loves the day and it was a great way to cool off on a 35 degree day. I highly recommend this water park. ,5.0
2280,Great time with Lego!,We had a great time at the water park. Heaps of slides and water playgrounds and yes very geared towards kids but a lot of fun too. Lego land was fun although a shame that the more adult rides were shut for maintenance. Expected a little more but we were probably spoils as we had been to universal studios the previous day. Extremely hot day and note that you can only enter the water park or Legoland once so couldn't cool off at the waterpark at the end of the day. We went in the coach from the Singapore flyer which was good.  One and a half to two hours journey each way. Fun day and kids will love the water park. ,4.0

2282,"Nice park for young kids, but keep your expectations low","Nice park, geared more for younger kids.  Sadly, staff need more training.   My daughter approached a number of staff member to swap mini-figures with, but most of the replies were that the figures were glued.  We even had one reply that his figure was fake and cannot be swapped.My daughter also accidentally left her container of mini-fgures in the Italian restaurant-  we had finished eating at 3.55pm, and proceeded to watch the 4D Lego Movie right beside at 4pm.  When we finished the movie, she remembered the figures and ran back to the restaurant.   The table was cleared and the container was gone.   We highly doubt that it was a guest the took the container, since the restaurant was almost empty at that time, and really, who would take interest in messy table with leftover food.   We had requested the staff to check the garbage, but they claimed not to find it.   I remain doubtful.  Considering the crappy service I got at the hotel, and how most of the staff would not swap figures, it isn't hard to doubt the staff.",3.0

2287,Enthusiastic stagg,"This was or third trip here over three years and I am pleased to say the park and hotel is still in good condition and very clean.  For me this visit was all about how friendly all the staff we encountered were. It was my son's 6th birthday so we went to customer services first off and got a birthday badge and present and all the staff came and sang happy birthday. There were three impromptu happy birthdays sung by the staff (and characters) throughout the day and two lots of cake for my Son.  Made his day very special. We went over two weekdays, which I highly recommend if you can do it. There was never more than a five minute queue for anything and mostly no queue at all. Makes the day so much easier. Also my Friend was there with her two kids aged 6 who were too small to ride by themselves on rides such as the boat school and dragons apprentice. At the boats one of the guys offered to ride with her Son so he didn't have to wait for his mum to take him on the second trip. Other times they looked after the child left behind at the front of the queue and then sorted out the swap when the ride ended. All the staff made such an effort to interact with the kids. Also impressed the facilities have been kept up well and haven't aged much since our first visit. The toilets were also very clean (especially for a theme park). Also got some good bargains with 50% off some swimwear, and clothing; especially with our exchange rate at the moment. From memory the hotel has made their check-out an hour later too and also opened the buffet dinner start at least half an hour earlier from when we were last there.  So those are good changes too. We will back back again next year! ",5.0
2288,Great park on a very quiet couple of days,The park is great for little and not so little kids but I think that we were lucky that there were only a handful of people in the park which meant no queues. Had a two days pass combo with hotel accommodation which meant we could go from one park to the other.Loved the log flume even more so that it was a really hot day and it help cool us down. Did not eat food in the theme park but in the water park and wished there had been healthier option. However the cafe at the entrance of the park seems to have really good food choices.,5.0

The signboard is located at the point of entry to the carpark, which is difficult to reverse out if you change your mind but you are given 15 minutes to get out (if you notice the signboard). Hope this message will give warning to drivers who is considering to park their car at Legoland Hotel to have a cup of coffee or lunch at that hotel. Residents can park for free.

2297,Good fun for all the family.,"We were lucky enough to spend two nights at the Legoland Hotel during our visit. We arrived at Changi Airport at 5.30pm and were picked up by a driver organised by the Hotel. We had been told that Legoland was about a one hour drive from Changi but what we hadn't been told was what the traffic would be like at this time of the night. The queues waiting to cross the border from Singapore to Malaysia could only be described as horrific. About two to three kilometres from the border about six lanes of traffic try to converge into two lanes for the final stretch. What chaos. About two hours later we were over the border and arrived at the hotel soon after 8pm.We had a pirate themed room which had a king size bed for the grandparents and in another room bunk beds for our daughter and grandson. A fascinating room which was beautifully decorated as a Pirates den.Meals in the hotel restaurant were Buffet and had a good range of food available. However we did find that nothing was very hot unless you went out on the balcony where fresh eggs etc were being cooked on the spot.Legoland itself made a wonderful day of fun and laughter. Admittedly we the grandparents did not participate on too many rides but we enjoyed ourselves watching the family enjoying themselves on all the rides from driving cars and boats to whipping around the track on the roller coaster.There is a large selection of rides and not being a weekend queues were never too long. There are also displays of famous buildings and areas made out of lego which are quite spectacular.All in all our two nights, one and a half days at Legoland were well worth while.",5.0
2298,Great adventure for the Lego lovers,"This place is such a great place to go for everything Lego and to bring out the child within you.

2299,"Overpriced, but at least not crowded in April!","My 7 year old LoVES Lego, so for his birthday we went to Legoland during spring break, which was a GREAT choice because it was empty and we literally did not have to wait for any rides whatsoever, and if I would have had to have waited, I would have been very disappointed. But, Legoland is not about adults, it is about kids, and my kids loved it! They loved all of it and were never bored! I thought it seemed childish, but for our 5 and 7 year old it was PERFECT! My biggest complaint is the stinking overall ridiculous prices for everything! After paying an arm and a leg for admission, the horrible food cost another appendage and then when my sons wanted to go to driving school and saw they could get their ""license"" I was asked to pay even more! 70 ringgit (about 18 bucks!) on top of the locker rental (another insulting 40 Ringgit), and each after ride picture of 80 Ringgit each if I am not mistaken (20 US dollars) it was madness and offensive....once was enough for me! We were wondering if we needed more than a day...since it was not busy, one day was sufficient. We took the shuttle from KL,,arrived at about 12 and were there until the park closed at 6.We will be returning to the States in the summer and my sister, who lives outside of Dallas, asked if I wanted to go to Legoland when we are there.....no thanks....",3.0
2300,"Feeling young, once more!!!",There's so much to see and things to do within this place. The boat and train ride is not just for the young ones but for the young once as well. I can't get enough of it. Lego here and there is so overwhelming. Landmarks and places of interest captured in Lego bricks is just adorable. The child in me is unleashed!,5.0

2302,For the young and young at heart,"Wow, where to begin. A whole day is not enough to maximize the fun you could do with this place! We were a group of 3 adults, and we enjoyed every experience. I think it would be good if you ride the Watch Tower first (so that you can take a good view of Legoland's whole terrain) and then ride the train second so you can go around the sights. After that, you can enjoy all attractions one by one. Staff was very friendly and overall the theme park was clean and well-maintained.",5.0
2303,Great fun for young kids!,"We visited in June 2015 and April 2016, our kids (9, 6.5, and 20 months) love it!  It was not as busy as the other theme parks we've visited so you don't have to wait long for the rides.  It's certainly much more relaxing than the Legoland in Florida, so if you live in Asia, I highly recommend Legoland Malaysia.  I'm pleasantly surprised that the food inside the park is not very expensive (unlike other themed parks).  Ice cream is RM4, which is very reasonable!Water Park is great, highly recommended.  Make sure you have good sunscreen.  They will have people taking some family photos for you, but be prepared it's quite expensive.Overall, great family destination!  We bought Premium Annual Pass and stayed at the Legoland Hotel.",5.0
2304,Good fun even with teenagers,Visited on a very hot day with a few rides a nice break from the heat.  Plenty to keep the kids entertained for the day.  Loved the models especially the port.  Tip: if the ride says you will get wet you will get drenched.  ,5.0

My daughter is 3 and it was such a memorable trip for her that every time I tell her we're going somewhere she asks if it's Legoland.The theme park itself is small.  Just enough for you to not be overwhelmed. Each area has a play area for kids who cannot ride the rides due to height or age requirement. We went on a Saturday and lines were tolerable (10 minutes wait or so).Get a passport from any ride, and get stamped every time you do an activity/ ride. Submit the passport and get a chance to win an overnight stay in Legoland hotel.",5.0
2306,Good place to visit with Family and Friends,The place is a must go for travelers who love some thrill. They have stuff to do for all ages of life. They have three roller coasters and a train that takes you around the whole park. The fun thing that we loved the most of the fire station. You are put in a Fire Engine that you as a family need to run. Its basically a group activity and lots of fun.They have areas where kids can build their own lego models and test it too.,5.0
2307,Great family time with wife and son,"We booked a room at the Legoland Hotel over the easter weekend and spent quality family time with my wife and son. The rooms are spacious enough for my son to keep running around in the room. The lego bricks in each room are fun to play with. Legoland Hotel guests also gets early access to the theme parks. As we stayed for 2 nights at the hotel, we thought it would be more worth to buy annual passes for my wife and I as my son is still complimentary (under 2 years old).The water theme costs us RM11 for my son and it comes with 2 swim diapers. He enjoyed the water slide but parents must accompany their young ones for safety reasons. Generally it was quite fun. Some water slides are probably suitable for older kids and have minimum height requirements. Be sure to check out the requirements before going for the stations. The floor can get very scorching hot when the sun is out, just be mentally prepared and try your best not to walk around barefooted.Renting of cabana is not really necessary unless you have a big group. The small hotel room-style locker provided at the cabana is only good for wallets, handphones, ipads and maybe some jewellery. If you need to put in bigger items like hand bags, then you can only leave it on the shelving provided which may require someone to attend to.Otherwise, you can use the lockers provided at the changing room area. RM40 for a big one and RM20 for a small one. Food at the water theme park is so-so. Did not have a chance to eat at Legoland Theme park. I went outside to Medini Mall to settle my dinner for 2 nights. Very much cheaper than the food served in Legoland and there's fast food like KFC and Burger King to choose from.Overall, the trip was enjoyable and the staffs were very professional. We thought that Legoland would be crowded on a public holiday weekend but turns out to be comfortable. We will definitely return to visit again.",5.0

2311,Fun Day at Legoland,"Legoland Malaysia, is very the first Legoland theme park in Asia. It is part of Legoland Resort which also consists of a water park and a Legoland themed hotel. Opened since 2012, it has over 40 interactive rides, shows and attractions. There are also more than 15,000 Lego models throughout the whole resort.During my trip in Singapore, Miss M and I joined a local tour (WTS) to cross the border over to Nusajaya, Johor. The meeting point was at the Singapore Flyer and the bus departed at around 9am. Legoland Malaysia is actually designed for families with children aged 2-12. But as fans of theme parks, we just had to give this place a visit.When we arrived, the very first thing we did was to look for food! It was already 11am by then and our stomachs were grumbling. There were several restaurants in the park and we decided to go to their Market Restaurant where they serve asian and western food.We had their chicken briyani and it was actually really good. Miss M liked the chicken curry so much that we went to ask for more. We both shared one combo meal which included a drink and a fruit dessert.After lunch, we headed to the middle of the park where they have an amazing display of miniature landmarks from all over the world ‚Äì Miniland. There are 18 separate sections displaying famous landmarks from Countries such as China, India, Singapore, India, Thailand and many more. I was pretty mesmerized with the detail and precision put into creating these structures.So after Miniland we roamed around the park and took various child-friendly rides. We went to Legoland on a weekday and it was not during holiday season. So the park was relatively empty ‚Äì good for us!The park itself is actually pretty small. Even after taking most of the rides, we realized that we‚Äôve explored the entire park in less than two hours. At 1pm, we headed to the city stage to watch their Ninjago live performance.The concept of the show goes like this ‚Äì there are ‚Äòninjas‚Äô in the background that controls the movement of the Ninjago characters as well as other props. They were so incredibly accurate with every movement of the figures, even with body reflex movements that we don‚Äôt realise we do. It was such a joy watching every scene come together. I‚Äôve seen many shows at other theme parks, but I would say this was one of the most entertaining shows I‚Äôve watched. With lots of time on our hands, we headed over to Lego Mindstorms to check out some of the indoor activities they have to offer. They had two workshops which runs almost every hour. One of the workshop was sort of like a fortress battle theme and another was surgery themed. We had signed up for both programs back to back. In both workshops, we learnt to program a robot wirelessly to do certain tasks using a Mindstorm NXT device. We could program the exact movements of the robot as well as instructing it to make sounds.Before exiting the park, we entered ‚ÄòThe Big Shop‚Äô which was located right next to the main entrance to see if there are any souvenirs to buy. In the end, we both created a customised lego keychain with our names engraved on it! A really neat souvenir to take home along with all the memories in this park.Overall, we really enjoyed ourselves. It was fun to see the variety of lego structures and models built in the park. Their rides and activities were fun and engaging. The whole park was also clean and comfortable.Despite peoples comments of the park being too small, there were actually enough things to do for one day, even for young adults. I can easily recommend any parent to bring their child to Legoland. It is a fantastic place to have fun as well as to learn.",4.0
2312,The theme park either is still growing or needs a bit more attention.,"Having visited another LEGOLAND (San Diego) we were a bit disappointed.  The park itself seems either run down a bit or not yet completed.  Just felt a bit shabby.  Rides and attractions were very similar to the San Diego park, but just not as good.  We went on a Monday and had no troubles with any lines.  This was the biggest plus in that we have very little waiting to deal with.  Food was priced quite reasonably and was pretty good.The staff there did not seem very interested in their jobs and this was a bit of a turn off.  My daughters enjoyed it and it was a reasonable value, but not up to an admittedly subjective ""international standard"".",3.0

2314,Great Experience ,"Legoland is a must to go for a family. There are two sections, one is the normal fun park with roller coasters and the other is a water park. I suggest that you spend one day in each park. The park is excellent for 2-7 years old kids. First day you can go to Legoland and they day after is for the water park. The hotel is very good for families. The room is divided into two sections for 2 adults and thee children. Each floor has its own theme. It's really amazing hotel for families. One night might be enough depending on your schedule. Weekdays is good time to go just to avoid the high number of visitors. Planning the visit is a must before any thing. Overall, the park and hotel is great experience. The hotel provides excellent service except the very late check in time (4pm) and too early check out time (11am). ",5.0

2323,"Pretty good fun, even if you're an adult","My Wife, two friends from JB & I went to Legoland as we'd heard great reviews about it. We weren't dissapointed. There are several sections to the park & all have great things to see. Yes there are the usual theme shops to buy as you enter/leave each section but that is the same as all theme parks-Disneyland, Warner Bros. etc etc. The main areas are as follows: Technic, Kingdoms,Imagination, Land of adventure, Lego City, Miniland & The Begining. Several areas have theme rides. The best rides i thought where The largere dragon ride, Technic Car ride, & boat ride at land of Adventure. Warning thou, The boat ride at land of Adventure you WILL GET WET. If you don't want to get wet, don't go on it. There is a train ride that will take you slowly round the park but once you're on, you cant get off untill the end. Not like Disneyland L.A. type. Great for kids & the young at heart. Usual security checks getting in but no problems taking your own drink & food. You should go as early as possible as the it gets pretty hot under the sun there. Pleanty of places to be in the shade though. The park opens at 10AM & there is a fee for parking. Plenty of places to eat outside of the park if you want.",5.0

In general it is a perfect heaven for your children. Don't forget to buy your tickets online for better deal.",4.0

2327,A good place to visit,"Legoland has similar games you can find in other theme park. However, you can see a lot of Lego blocks forming a lot of interesting items. To play Legoland with small kids, you can start playing in anti-clockwise direction. It is because the games suitable for kids are located at right hand side of the park.To play Legoland with teenagers or adults, you can start playing in clockwise direction. It is because roller coasters are located at the left hand side of the park. However, don't pay too much time in queuing up the Observation Tower, there is nothing special you can see from the top of the tower. You need to pay for about 7 hours to play most of the game.",4.0
2328,Waste of money and time!,I visited the park with my 2 children aged 2.5 and 5. The park had very limited rides for the children. I think they must have went on 3 rides in the 2 hours we spent there. There seemed to be more cafes there than rides. A big disappointment especially as there are so many positive reviews on here.

Thumbs up for the room decorations, Lego toys and the treasure chest! They do make my boys asked to stay there forever! You can also just walk in 5min to the waterpark and the theme park. Too bad no bathtub fun; but it's a minor point. Toiletries are basic. Wifi is terribly slow though. Aircon in the corridors and lobby are quite cold, but you can control the AC in your own room. Bfast spread is wide, but options are mostly carbo for highly active kids. Service is generally good except during the super busy bfast time. Overall not bad and we will be back again.",4.0
2330,Great for the Little Ones,"Rides were quite kiddy and not that thrilling for grown ups - but overall, the park was pretty and nicely done.",3.0
2331,"Fun indeed, albeit the heat!","A fun theme park, with much to do for people of all ages, especially if you're a Lego fan. In fact, a non-fan can be made a fan once they visit this place. The rides are fun, and the miniatures are awesome. There are many Lego builds around the park, but the sad part is that the colours were fading due to the extreme heat. The water park was really fun, and really enjoyable. Perfect way to beat the heat. The Big Shop in the park was disappointing. Me being a fan, I was looking for more Lego options to purchase but there were none. Mostly mass produced ones. Looks like I can get better options elsewhere. Remember to come in early when they open to maximise the visit as they close at 6pm. ",4.0
2332,Amazing Creations,"We went there on March 26, 2016 and I bought our Legoland and Hello Kitty Town tickets online through ASIATRAVEL.com and I would like to give thanks to them for catering our need for transportation (private transfer to legoland and hello kitty town from our SG hotel) on a very good price. The staffs were really accommodating and patience to my queries and requests. Even on last minute changes they arranged our hotel pick up location. Their local transport partner was kind and accommodating also. Very friendly. Two thumbs up for SADI BIN SARIMAN of TRAVEL DELIGHT.Its so amazing how people behind Legoland created such lego miniatures of different places around the world and a lot more.. Really a kid's place.. Souvenir items can be bought using your SGD or RM.. Just prepare your hat or mini fan to refresh due to hot weather but there are some places for ventilation and have AC so its fine.. I advise that you should bring your SGD or better exchange your currency with RM when you go there becoz the one and only money changer nearby is not reliable since its offline when we got there. Poor me that i missed buying more souvenirs due to lack of currency.We ate lunch outside Legoland Theme Park and I recommend TS Restaurant.. Great Food.. The manager was really the best because my daughter happened to like their side soup with balls and I tried to order it again but the manager gave it for free and we were surprised the he even add more balls to our take out dried noodles! Superb! Over all its a place I want to go back and bring my nephews and niece and want to try also the water park coz we missed it since we opted to go at Hello Kitty Town by 2pm on the same day. ",4.0
2333,Excellent for children,"We took a holiday here over the New Year and the children had a blast. 90% of the activities are geared towards children 3-16 years old. Even the adults enjoyed. Wear a hat and apply sunscreen as the midday tends to get very hot. Food selection is just okay. The kids enjoyed seeing the Lego characters. If its any indication, the kids want to come back to this place already.",5.0
2334,Fun Place for the Family,"It's not as big as other well known theme parks but it's still a great family holiday destination. Long lines at the ticket counter, very very very very slow turnover.  Lines at the rides were not long except for the driving school.  Very limited food selections.  I lost my mobile phone there.  I asked if they have cameras so we could see who got it.  No cameras in public places, only in the cashiers' area.  Restrooms were clean.  Some food stalls served food only after 1pm.",3.0

2336,Re-entry is not possible ,"When I took my son for a weekend trip to Legoland on March 26, I found it not efficient for us not being able to re-enter the theme park. The entrance ticket was not cheap, almost the same as Universal Studio in Singapore. While we could be stamped on our hand (UV stamp) for re-entry if we would like to go out from the park. This means we could enjoy the whole day in Univeraal studio.At Legoland, when I took my son to enter the Water Park, I could not enter the Theme Park again and I have to wait at the outlet outside Legoland.The food inside Legoland also was run out and we could not get anything to eat unless we got out n ate at the food outlets alongside the pathway outside Legoland. Even the Burger King outlet outside Legoland had a long queue because only 2 staff were on duty.The water park should be inside the theme park so adults could wait at the theme park stores or food outlets without going out of the park. Because not all adults would like to play in the waterpark. Having to pay additional money just to accompany a teenager was too much. The distance from water park to the outlets outside Legoland was quite far so as parents we have to walk a long way to check whether our children were done or not with the water. If we were allowed to re-enter the theme park then it would be easier for us to meet up at a point inside Legoland without having to walk out of the property.",3.0
2337,A nice family outing,"Although it caters more for a child, we had a great time visiting Legoland. Make sure that you go early in the morning",4.0
2338,Great theme park for kids,I wasn't sure what to expect from Legoland on our day trip from Singapore (we went by private driver sourced from Malaysia- which was fantastic!) but we were very happy we made the effort.The Ninjago show was a highlight and the Lego constructions throughout the park were fantastic.Highly recommend!,5.0
2339,Great Water & Theme Park,"For parents with toddlers, Legoland is one of the best places to bring the kids. We went to both Water park and the theme park. It was crowded as expected becasue it was a long weekend. The service in the food counters were pathetic. They were very slow and you have to wait sooo long for the food. ",4.0
2340,Good for a day,I went there with my 2 young children and they certainly had good fun.One day is enough in my view and best is probably to spend the morning in the attraction park and the afternoon in the water park.It is a fairly normal park without anything extraordinary so to speak but its layout is well thought through. You may queue here and there but nothing major to complain about!Plan your trip carefully if you depart from Singapore since crossing the border usually takes time on your way there (and on the way back!).,4.0
2341,Great for kids,"Great place for kids.Legoland is big place, a good distance walk from one ride to others. Not many shady place and ofcourse its hot towards noon. In some rides have to wait almost one hour but it all depends on the crowd. Anyway my kids enjoy it. ",3.0
2342,good for small kids,"Good and small amusement park for small Kids (Kids older than 10y might not be so interessted). Please note that the rides have min. heights which the staff control strictly. Most rides require min. height of 100cm, but some are also requesting 110cm.",4.0
2343,Kids love it,Lovely place for kids n adults alike. Amazingly put miniature structures. Kids love the driving school.The train free ride was nice.You need to avoid weekends.Very hot during the day.4D movie show was quite ordinary though.the roller coasters are good but better not try after lunch.I made a day trip from KLL and came back in the night by air Asia flights.Entry ticket can be bought online. Metred Cabs available from airport for 68Rm but when you come back you have to pay 80Rm as 12Rm is service charge for other taxis for entering airport.the drive is nice along the way.,4.0
2344,Every brick counts...,"The rides are exciting, and this place really gives you this reminiscence and fondness for Lego toys. Humongous statues bring about such wonder and excitement as you go different stations or sites. More so, you will see the microcosm or replicas of places around the world. Truly a world of play, imagination, wonder, and fun!",5.0
2345,Great but forget wifi ,"Last day here with kids age from 7-13.We stayed for 4 nights over the Easter break. Stayed in the Kingdom room which can sleep 8. Clean and had everything we needed. The treasure box kept the kids amused. The gifts inside were a pleasant surprise. Restaurant was surprisingly good with good variety. Candy was everywhere so the kids were happy. They had a decorate doughnut or cupcake station every night which was fun for the youngest. Breakfast was also good but need to get there before 8am otherwise the queue starts building up. The entrance to the hotel was a favourite hangout for the kids. Plenty of Lego to keep them amused. The park was fantastic. Well organised so not too much walking to get from one area to another. Rides good fun but probably not interesting for older then 13, too tame. Food variety good. Considering it was Easter break, it wasn't too crowded and the waiting time for the rides were 1-15minutes only. The water park was also fun and well maintained. Again the slides are not as wild as some other parks, so not very exciting for the oldest child. My only complaint about the whole trip was the wifi - non existent. The only time I could get on the Internet was just around breakfast time when I guess people are still sleeping or eating breakfast. Any other time - forget it. Could not check email, surf or anything. Totally hopeless. ",4.0
2346,Children Paradise,A day trip to Johor (Malaysia) if you are in Singapore.You can either take a public transport or to hire a private car transfer which pick up you and your family from hotel straight to the theme park.The travelling is around 1 hour from Singapore.You will spend average 5-6 hours (non-peak) on this place as it is not that huge.,4.0
2347,Worth the effort.,This is a great venue. We went via an organised bus trip which was very cost effective and easy. I think this venue is suitable for 12 years and under or a Lego enthusiast. We went on a week day and there were no queues and we got to ride on some rides more than once. The staff were incredibly friendly. We spent all day in the Legoland park and didn't venture to the water park.,4.0
2348,Fun Especially For Lego Lovers & Kids,"It was a fun trip. Just visited the theme park only, so I can't say about the hotel and water park. Lots of things to do, but most of it are for the kids. The new Lego 4D movie is okay, but I think the best and memorable part is the new NinjaGo Theater located at Lego City, such and amazing experience. Star Wars area is cool too. All in all, definitely will be going back there.",4.0

2350,"Hot and wet, fun trip!","2nd time here. Rides in the theme park looks well maintained. No worries on safety for the kids. Staff in general were polite and courteous at both parks. One comment is that the staff needs a bit of training on the commentary/announcement on the Legoland Express. Pronunciation was not great plus the sound that came out of the speakers were bad. Muffled. My 4 year old son was denied from doing a few rides because of height restrictions which was good. Knowing that safety is kept at a high level made me feel confident for the kids to go on the rides. The water park was a loads of fun. I would suggest for families to rent the cabana's. You get drinks, a safe deposit box to put your valuables in plus shade from the scorching heat.Toilets were clean which are important. The locker and the shower areas were also clean. Good job there.Try out all the rides on the top level. Min height is about 107cm (4/5 years old) for some of the rides. Others are 102cm.Was another great trip for my family. Will be back soon.",4.0

2352,Fun Fun Fun,"We brought our 2 kids, and  with 2 other families, had a great time in Legoland. Despite the super hot weather, all kids had lots of fun playing in the few exciting rides. So, arm yourself with sunscreen, hat and lots of water for the whole day of fun in the park. ",4.0
2353,"Good, but hot!","As my travel companion is a Lego fan, we decided to do a day trip from Singapore to Legoland.  We booked our tickets online as there was a special online, and later booked a bus with WTS to get there.  We were on the first bus at 8.30pm and after going through customs/immigration, we didn't arrive at Legoland until 11.30am.  (Apparently that was a good run!).The park is obviously aimed at kids (both big & little ones!) with a number of rides.  We didn't go into the Water Park section, and only went on two rides - the Technic Rollercoaster; and the Temple Log Ride (which we did to get wet as it was so hot!). There were not a lot of shaded areas around, but there were shops and food places scattered around where we would go into just to enjoy a bit of air conditioning.  The worse place is the Mini Land section in the middle as it is mostly open - but there are some great creations worth seeing such as a mini Singapore; mini Taj Mahal & many more. Most of the food places were the usual burgers, pizza or pasta - which was reasonably priced, but average taste.  I would've liked to have some more traditional / local foods instead.  The only thing I did see was the Ais Kacang which we shared (one between two is very sufficient).. which was very refreshing but the bottom part was a bit too milky for my liking and the beans and corn with ice cream was unusually interesting.Overall the park was enjoyable, and the lego creations around the park were very interesting to see; but by 5pm we had seen enough (we weren't really ride people).  Our bus wasn't until 6.45pm so we spent some time shopping for small souveniers and having a drink before heading to the bus. We did try to get an earlier bus, but no luck.  On the upside, the bus trip back was only 2 hours instead of 3.",4.0
2354,Go Midweek During the School Year!,"This was my favorite theme park experience ever, far surpassing all of the Disney parks (Ca and Fla), Sea World and Universal.  My son likes Legos more than things at those places, but I like this park both because it was well designed for flow and with good rides for all ages, but mostly for how during the time we chose to go it was like we were billionaires who rented the park to ourselves for the day.  Both days, we shared the park with about 100 other people and never waited in a line.  If that would have been different, I feel as though the park's queueing systems were well designed with adequate shade for the elements.  Because of how 'dead' the park was, I was very impressed at the staff, who could have been bored and lifeless, but instead greeted us enthusiastically and treated as very special.  I have great memories of our visit and thank all of the staff who made us feel special!",5.0
2355,Good for the little ones ,"First visit to Legoland and very impressed by it. We came on Saturday and surprisingly there were hardly any visitors on that day. The miniland was impressive and we were amazed by all the Lego structures. The rides were just average, more for the young ones so don't expect too thrilling rides. The park was kept extremely clean in all public areas including toilets.One thing I have to say, the staff were EXTREMELY friendly and full of smiles. They really genuinely want you to enjoy your day. Just a reminder, make sure you have sun block as it can get extremely hot during the day.",5.0
2356,"The water park is an enjoyable place for kids, which is basically Legoland's main target audience","We had visited Legoland Theme Park a couple of times and this is the first time we visited the Water Park, which is located next to the Legoland Hotel.We arrived early on a Friday morning and got our entry tickets slightly after 10am at the main ticketing booth. I believe you can also get tickets at the Water Park itself, where the queue was basically non-existent.  Upon entry, we also booked a cabana at RM300 which was a little pricey, but we had wifi connection for 2, 2 souvenir towels, 10 soft drinks and mineral water, 2 chairs and 2 deck chairs, and a mini safe.The park was not crowded at all, even though it was a Friday (ie. a weekend in Johor and other parts of Malaysia), and it's during the Malaysian and Singapore school holidays.  We were able to try out all the slides (some more than 4 times) before noon. The more thrilling slides are the Lego Slides Racer and Tidal Tube. We also enjoyed the Brick Blasters, Splash and Swirl, red Rush and Splash Out. The Lazy River (or Build-A-Raft River) is really a place to laze for adult visitors, and kids would get bored with building the raft and enjoy more going with the flow of the ""river"".  Kids will enjoy the Imagination Station too.We had lunch at the Beach N Brick Grill. Simple combo meals are about RM25, and is nothing to shout about.  A side note - the French fries were terrible.Being a Friday, the operating hours at the water park is extended to 9pm. But it's really only the Wave Pool that is operating, and the rest of the slides and attractions are closed. Of course, the food outlet Beach N Brick Grill and the gift shop will still be operating.The shower area is large and generally clean, which is a nice touch.  Overall, the water park is an enjoyable place for kids, which is basically Legoland's target audience.  However, the pricing is a little steep and improvements should be considered in the area of food and beverage, and the pricing of the cabanas.  Additional shelter from the scorching sun would be appreciated. ",4.0
2357,Not the 1st visit but had a better time than previously,"This is not our 1st time to the park.  We visited the park when it 1st opened in 2012 and a couple more times in 2014. However, we had the best experience this time round.We self-drove and stayed at Somerset Medini. It was a 5-7mins walk to Legoland through Mall of Medini.Tickets were bought online 3 days in advance to enjoy discounts. Entry was easy as we printed and had our tickets all ready.We visited the park on a Saturday but for some reasons, it wasn't as crowded as it used to be.  For most rides, we did not have to wait for more than 5mins.  The Dragon Apprentice had a longer waiting time (approx.20mins).Service was definitely better than previous times; friendlier. We went to the water park as well, but unprepared.  Had to buy swimwear and towel from the shop, again, the staffs were very helpful.The kids enjoyed at least 3hours of play at the kids area.Would recommend this place to people who love rides or lego.",4.0
2358,Attractively awesome,"ParkIf you are not a Lego lover, then ideally you should take kids when you come to this park. Kid aged 3 y.o. and >92cm tall should be able to start enjoy some attraction and ride (although I think the optimum will be >6-8 years old and 120cm). Make some strategy: think about ride queue time vs scheduled attraction, direction: clockwise/counter clockwise, etc..Car park (Zone1/Zone 2)It's open space with direct expose to the sun. Do not confused, no ticket will be provided when you enter the this car park. Later when you leave, you can buy the park ticket or just tap your Touch n Go card to exit (10RM per entry).Locker rentTypical theme park with computerized birth date and favorite colour question. Multiple times reopenable. They have locker rent at certain point.Rest roomSo clean, really clean especially considering this is public space where visited by crowd everyday. I love it!",4.0

The park was small with about 5 exciting rides and the rest are for smaller children. Park was clean and well maintained. Locker is charged at rm20. Food was ok, at about rm23 for a set meal.

Some good games are very interactive such as fire rescue, driving schools and some LEGO assembly session within the park.Ninjago show is very good with a nice background, and some 4D show are very interesting. Beware of the 4D show because there will be  large amount of water splashing during the show which is dangerous to electronic devices and camera.Lego Starwars Miniland is one of the best! Somehow i am still unhappy on something.Just like all theme park in this world, the food is overpriced. Also, the car park charged rm 10 which i think not reasonable. Customers already paid hundred of dollar for entrance and yet car park is still not free.",3.0

2374,Suitable for young kids,"Legoland is a small theme park. We only stayed there for 2 hours since it was extremely hot there even though it was early (we left at 11.30 am). We know nothing about Lego and we didn't bring kids; hence we didn't really enjoy this park. There is a bus from JB Sentral that will take you to Legoland, Hello Kitty Town, and Johor Premium Outlet. To reach Legoland you can get off at Medini Mall or the deserted parking area of Legoland. I suggest you alight and wait for your return bus at Medini Mall since the walk to/from Legoland is through the mall, thus you would be protected from the harsh sun. Please check bus schedule as  buses are not frequent.",1.0

The park was very clean, toilets were also clean and the food at the cafe near the front entrance was amazing (so was the service at that Cafe- the staff were so nice). The only negative is the front entrance to the park. You walk down a long concrete pathway and it looks unfinished. They should also have toilets near the bus stop- as we had to walk all the way back for our little girl and it took ages. Overall, worth visiting & a great experience for the kiddies. ",4.0

Taking some pictures in front of Legoland Malaysia and some other spots. I suggest you to be there around 5pm till 6.30pm.

Also was able to do the Waterpark as well in the day, i'm think on a busy day you would probably have to split your visit into 2 days but on a quiet day Lego land and waterpark was doable in 1 whole day we arrived at 10am and went home at closing time 6pm.

2383,For Family Outings,"This is quite a nice theme park for a family outing. But the colors of the plastic legos have started to fade in the strong tropical sun, giving it a tired look. It will probably operate for another few years before newer and more exciting theme parks will replace it, unless the park could come up with more original and new ideas.",3.0
2384,Nice getaway,"Visited the park from 4-6 March. It's really empty and most rides have no queues and longest wait is probably 5-10mins(maybe only once or twice a day).The rides are mainly for kids and the most exciting one is the project x roller coaster. Most rides are not suitable for my 3 year old son so I don't think it's worth it to pay a ticket to bring him there. Maybe the park change the requirement for entry ticket to 4 year old.Mini world is a bit old and needs some upgrading. Park has limited manpower and they put the 'under maintenance sign' when there is no staff manning the ride. Even though it's for the less popular ride, it's still unacceptable.Overall it was an enjoyable place for my kids(3 and 5).",4.0
2385,FUN,"we visited both dry & wet park. they were fun, & also d shopping. it s recommended to stay in lego hotel if you have more time, so can manage in a more relax way to hop between parks.caution: d weather is constantly hot... be prepared. it doesn't has many trees to shade us also.",4.0
2386,A great day for the little ones,"We stayed at the Legoland resort (highly recommended rather than doing a day trip), then spent the next day here. We purchased the 'combo' ticket which allowed us entry to the water park, and to go in and out of both parks as we pleased for the day. It was fortunately low season, so there was hardly anyone at the park- we did not have to wait more than 1 minute for any of the rides which was fantastic, and meant the we had plenty of time to also spend at the waterpark. Many of the rides Took us round 2-4 times as there was nobody lining up waiting for them! We had a wonderful day, and would recommend the park for children <8yo, our son was elated and exhausted after a fun day out. NB. The Lego you can purchase here is no cheaper than you can get at any toy store so unfortunately there are no bargains to be had. We did purchase a set for our son, just so he could say he got it at Legoland, but we could have got it cheaper on sale at home.",4.0
2387,Enjoyable for Kids,"We went there during the Ramadan period. Me and my son were so lucky since there wasn't much people at the park. Our expectations were so high since it's the only Legoland Resort in Asia and we've just finished going to Universal Studios in Singapore. When we arrived, the rides were not that thrilling. They have a 4D show where I slept in the theater because it was not a 4D show at all and to add to that, it was a silent film. My son enjoyed the building center where they get to make their own cars and race with other kids. Food, forget it!",2.0
2388,An underwhelming visit,"We visited the dry park. The rides were limited and the queues were long. Only 2 or 3 rides that were adult worthy, and frankly spending so much for primary school kids to play at the kiddy areas is really not worth it at all.",2.0
2389,Theme Park for yound children,"i was here alone with my 2 kids aged 6 and 4. Both kids very enjoy in the park and we came during 4th day of CNY 2016. At first i was worried about the crowd as it was a  super peak period, but it was fine. The q in ticket counter and some ride still manageble. the longest q for ride was the fire rescue academy which take abount 15 minutes. other ride like water boat we just skipped. no q for hourse riding and 4D movies. we all enjoy the movie. Thumps up to the friendly staff which always help us take photos and give us info where to start our ride when we enter the park. Family toilet is big enough for me to bring 2 kids together. Food are average ,mostly on western and is not cheap. They have meal voucher Rm10 for each pax. The day we went is not a hot and sunny day but we still sweat and wet, less covered space. around 3pm plus started to rain and we just left. Parking fee is Rm10. the machine is too sensitive and i try so many notes only it accept. my suggestion is 1. to install shelter all the way to the open space car park and please build a covered car park. 2. To have more covered space / indoor games / ride inside the park. 3. To provide more food variety especially local food.",4.0

2391,Family happiness,"We have fun and choose the waterpark as well. love the mural and all the attraction there. Take free bus from Hello Kitty to Legoland. You must take locker to keep your belonging. So far, the kids want to come back to this place.",4.0
2392,Great place for little kids,We came here with our 8 and 5 year old boys and they loved it!! We were lucky enough to come during the week and not once did we have to wait for a ride and at times we got to go around and around on the roller coaster until someone lined up. Like most parks they try and sell you things along the way but that is to be expected. If you can try and make it to the Lego Ninja show. They use an old style of Japanese puppetry called Bunraku which is a great experience for the kids and a great way to cool down for around 45min. Food is overpriced and not the best tasting so go back out and eat in the many restaurants if you can. Also there is a huge lego shop at the entrance and they have sets that are exclusive to Lego Land Malaysia and again slightly over priced but they have some great sets if you have lego fans. Red taxis are cheaper than the blue taxis however there are only blue ones available so expect to pay more heading home.,5.0
2393,What you should expect!,"Definitely a premium site for kids and families. By kids, perhaps 12 and below. Hotels rooms are very interesting, spacious and can fit a small family. The adjacent Waterpark draws more from the children then the miniature legoland cities in Legoland. Worth a visit but not enough to come back again.",3.0

2395,Awesome fun with kids and family,Really had fun...Wet park was very nice..the rides are safe for kids above 6yrs old to have a go at it themselves...would need a lot of energy since it involves a lot of climbing staircases..but really worth it..kids really enjoyed themselves...all the rides are safe and well managed by the working crew...just follow their instructions and enjoy each and everyone of your rides..and the crew are very helpful as well when you need any help...they are always willing to help...Best one was the one where u sit with ur partner and go thru the swirls and drops in a long tube...You can loiter around the main pool..though it get extremely hot by noon..there are food outlets nearby serving pricey food (as expected)...toilet was ok..quite clean as well...The dry park was super fun...Again..u need a lot of energy to walkaround the park fron end to end and maybe double up each ride...All are again safe n fun for kida..as long as u follow the instructions...Best one would be the wet roller coaster...make sure u bring dry towels...Food as expected...a bit pricey...Make sure u buy a 2 day pass so that each day u can go into both parks...recommend to go for the dry park in the am..then by pm..just into the wet park...And in all..make sure u drink lots of water cos it could be a hot and dry day when u r out there..Car park...u can park at medini mall where it is slightly cheaper than parking at legoland car park...,4.0
2396,Fun in the sun,"This Legoland is very beautiful with cool rides. One of my experience was that when I ride on one of the roller coasters, at the end, it suddenly stopped. What had happened was one of the kids have played with the stop button. They were scolded after but I hope the Legoland staff will be more responsible and see to their rides. All in all, its pretty expensive but its a worthwhile experience.",4.0
2397,Size,What a waste of time even though it was a nice place to visit but did not cater for the bigger person plus they did not say anything about the long wait going through custom both way from Singapore,2.0
2398,loved this place,"I have to make it clear that I'm not a fan of super thrilling roller coasters like those in Universal studios, so I took a liking to the less exhilarating but still exciting rides that legoland and had to offer. for a person who hasn't been to any other legolands before, I was quite enticed by the whole concept and it was enough to keep me there for almost a day I guess? my mum had fun too, since she wasn't really suited to ride extreme roller coasters at her age. I figure that the average adult will find the place boring, but it will be great for the kids (: the adults can just spend their time marvelling at all the works made purely out of lego blocks and take tons of pictures  (:",5.0

2400,Up the service,-Was at Legoland for work purposes.-Well-maintained after my last trip 3 years ago.-Would appreciate a much warmer service from the staffs.-Enjoyed Star Wars display.-Food and ticket prices are quite expensive.Probably visit once every few years unless there are new attractions.-Live performances would make the place more happening.-No wifi connection.-Need higher surveillance from both family and staffs.,3.0
2401,love the variations provide here,"we just visit the legoland water park theme.. one of attraction provide inside legoland area.. this theme park is more suitable for children small than 7 years since the playground provide here is safer.. ticket price is a little bit higher here (122 RM / adult on 2016 february) compare to other water theme park in johor baru.. but worth to try since the variations provide is more than enough.. my little girl cant stop playing here for almost 4 hours non-stop.. she love it very much.. better to rent a locker for those who going there without some one looking for your goods.. the locker area is also clean and so nothing to worry about.. compare to ticket price, locker price is very cheap and reasonable i think..you dont have to expert in swimming to play in this area.. mostly the water area is not so deep.. even my little girl (5 years old) can stand in the most of attraction area.. so very very safe.. but better if there is adult watch out while your little one playing inside.. my suggest if you bring not older than 6-7 years old, better to this water park.. and then suggest you come earlier on 10-11 am maybe until they close on 6 PM.. the ticket is for whole day so arrange you time wisely..",5.0
2402,Love it,Bought annual pass just to make sure that we can come again and again without needing to purchase the tickets frequently. My kids are still having fun though we came here many times already. ,5.0
2403,Just Awesome,"This place is just a heaven for young children or even teenagers who loves fast rides, roller coaster kind of things, perhaps. Legoland has lots of rides that you got to hop on besides few attractions such as famous buildings or architectures around the world made from Lego blocks. It might be a little expensive but worthy. There is also a room where everyone can go in and play with Lego blocks. It was quite fun for my whole family.",4.0
2404,Fun place for kids,"To be fair, it rained extremely heavily on the day I visited the place. Hence, I did not quite enjoy it.The outdoor Lego display were impressive but a little discolorated. I particularly love the Star Wars display, it is fantastic!I would say it is a great place for kids as there are a lot of hand-on and kiddy rides. As for adult, Lego collector, there are many shops selling Lego with different themes.The ticket is expensive, about SGD60. For anyone who intends to visit Legoland more than once, I would suggest getting an annual pass as it cost about SGD110.",3.0
2405,Absolute horrible experience. Terrible safety standard,"My wife got badly injured in the facility (Lego Slide Racer, i.e. the speedy slide with players sliding on a mat in different tracks) on the date, which caused by the negligence and wrong instruction of the waterpark staffs. When my wife slide down from this facility, there was still a little still on the lower track. Their heads bumped together and my wife forehead got badly injured. This should not be happened as the staff on the tower asked the players to go, but there were still people on the lower track. The safeguard or staff should be highly aware there are still users on the track. Unfortunately, the accident happened due to the negligence of the safeguard and wrong instruction of the staff on tower. My wife and me have asked the safeguards why there are still users on the tracks and they ask the players sliding down. He and the teams cannot answer. That was totally unacceptable as this slide is a speed track which can absolutely cause fatal accident.My wife got a very short unconscious and serious giddy afterwards. Her forehead was swelling.The manager and supervisors didn't show any concern on the case. They repeated just on to take a photo of my wife injury for their report writing. The manager was chewing gum when he was talking with us.We requested for ambulance to send my wife to hospital after making the decision. The supervisor mentioned the ambulance is on the way. But after 1 hour waiting we found it was just a Legoland van without any emergency facility. She said the driver would take us to the hospital.We requested a Legoland waterpark staff should accompany with us to the hospital. The supervisor initally said only the driver will go with us. After we requested several times, she assigned a lady in first aid team to accompany us to the hospital. However, when arrived the hospital, the lady simply run away. I requested her to stay and inform her boss the status. But she rejected.This was totally unacceptable and irresponsible. If you want to gamble on your life, you may try it on",1.0
2406,Lots of Fun,"We went there with my parents in-laws, my bro-in-law & nephews ... We had lots of fun at the Legoland ... It's provide nice trilling rides and water rides as well ... We took a day trip starting with the Legoland and the 2nd half of the day at the water theme park.Both were excellent Very suitable for family outing for all ages ",5.0
2407,A Good Place for the Family!,The Theme Park is very enjoyable to Kids and also adults. My Grandchildren enjoyed so much as they are avid builders of Lego bricks. My wife and my sons and daughters also enjoyed the rides. The price is affordable. Just a short trip as an add-on to places you can visit while in Singapore. Plenty of places to eat too.,4.0
2408,Very Good Place for Kids.,Everything about Lego from rides to shows. Average Theme Park that your kids will enjoy rides and shows.Amazing miniature lego sculpture.Not a good place for adult.Have Direct buses here from Singapore.5 hours would be enough to stay here if you have kids. Highly recommended to all kids..,5.0
2409,Simply Awesome! ,"This theme park is awesome. It has everything you loved. From kids until adults.We've tried the pizza restaurants, it tastes good.We've also visit the Water park. It's as great as the theme park. But it could be scorching heat from the sun.",5.0

2411,Great park for the little ones !,The Park is great for kids (and adults) who are really into Lego.  Bring lots of water though as it tends to get really warm.  They should put a shade over the Mini-Lego Land so the children wouldn't be discouraged by the heat from going around the different structures.,4.0

2415,Childhood dream come true,"The place was great. The love for lego is not only for kids , here , you will be amazed with the games and attractions build up from lego.

2416,Nice theme park,"This theme park has extensive area of Lego displays. There are also rides for kids. A car ""Driving School"" where your kid will get a ""Driving Licence"" after he completes a round. Theatres with Star Wars display and more. Shows etc. great for smaller kids. There is a dedicated water theme par as well where the kids and adults can cool down.",4.0
2417,Pre-Valentines' Day Date,"Tip #1: Book your tickets at the Legoland Malaysia website. The tickets are far cheaper to purchase at the website than on-site. Book your tickets a week in advance for more savings! You need not print the ticket out. Just save the emailed ticket pdf file to your smartphone device and show that to the ticket booth at the right of the entrance turnstiles. They will print the ticket for you at no cost. Tip #2: This is an outdoor park, so it may get really hot around noontime, and then it would suddenly rain some time around 3:00PM. So, bring an umbrella. And, put some sunscreen on. Tip #3: I went on a Saturday just after the Chinese New Year. Lots of Chinese from the mainland, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. However, I didn't need to queue up for long periods of time at each ride. Just in case, make sure you have data on your phone and some games installed. Review: I honestly wished I was a kid again strolling around the park. But, don't get me wrong, the kid in me was unleashed in the park, and I'm quite sure the kid in you would be as well! I would like some more rides in the future. I do hope they expand the park and add more Lego mini-structures. Currently, they only have mostly ASEAN, China, and India mini-structures.",5.0
2418,Fantastic Time,"Lots of different rides for different ages at the park. Brought my 2-year old as well as an 8-year old and both had a fantastic time. For the 2-year old, there's the big train and the small train rides, steer your own boat (small life-vest provided), a few different types of playgrounds, shows to watch and some rides to play. So there's lots to do for all ages. ",4.0
2419,Pros & cons,"We visited both the theme park & water park on Sun 14 Feb. Lego brings back certain fond memories. Traffic was surprisingly smooth from SG. Not many visitors & queues needed only minutes. Staff were generally friendly & allowed a second ride without having to queue again. Food was tasty. Rained for a while but there were no issues as shelters almost everywhere, especially near the entrance. A key inconvenience was as such we were told we could go in swimwear from the waterpark to the theme park & we did so as we headed directly for the water-themed ride there, which was quite a distance away. When we finally reached, we were then informed swimwear was not allowed there. The conflicting advice was exasperating. After changing out of swimwear, we enjoyed the ride, which left us soaking wet & guess what? There were no shower facilities in the theme park! The blowdry facility cost rm10 & doesnt do a good job. We made our way out of the themepark & returned to the waterpark just for a shower before going to the themepark again. Luckily ours was a combo pass which allowed unlimited entry - what if it wasnt? The hassle of walking to and fro was also ridiculous.At the waterpark, different floats had to be used for different rides & this was definitely unclear, creating inconvenience. The park maintenance can be improved significantly as signs of ageing were evident everywhere. Signages can also be improved for directions. ",3.0
2420,Great hit with younger kids,We've been to Legoland California and now Legoland Malaysia and found Malaysia  better value for money and a lot less crowded but it didn't feel as 'new'.  We were there during heavy smog so it made the resort seem a little dusty/dirty. We still had a very enjoyable time and loved the water park and would recommend people make the journey from Singapore to visit.We'd also recommend staying the night at Legoland hotel.,4.0
2421,Great afternoon ‚òÄÔ∏è,"Visited the waterpark only for an afternoon between 2-6pm The whole family went aged between 9 and 78 !! Something for everyone to ride on , some very gentle, others not !! Great fun and definitely recommended ",5.0
2422,Really suitable for family with young kids.,"Went on the first day of CNY, prebook combo tickets (land and water) (get discount price). We came from Taiwan and was worried about the wet weather they had been having. It was a little bit overcast which luckily worked in our favour, not very busy. Waiting lines were short for most of the places we went to. Long queue at the driving school activity - I noticed they made only half of the activity's capacity available. Our kids (4 and 6) enjoyed the Dragon. At the Merlin's Challenge , one mother held up the waiting line because her kids are too young and/or didn't meet the height requirement and made much fuss (and again at the Royal Joust). Felt sorry for the staff who had to deal with unreasonable park visitors. But then the same staff spent way too much time on the checking process. 1. Open gate, 2. Prospective rider enter, 3. Close gate, 4. Check height. Most of them you could clearly tell are above the height restriction.We enjoyed the Water Splash twice! We had lunch at a restaurant that serves local food, love it! One feedback to the restaurant: ice cream that comes with the meal melted before we finished the food. Maybe a separate voucher for ice cream redemption. At the water park for two hours, plenty for young kids to do, my son enjoyed building the boat and watch it flows.Overall the kids had so much fun there! Personally, I think for a theme park that's been operating for 2 years it seems to lack efficiency in their process of beginning, during and end of each ride. ",4.0
2423,Great hit with the kids,We travelled with two other families with young kids and it was a fantastic outing. The rides and activities were fun and a great opportunity for family bonding. We came on a weekday and it was not crowded. Waits for rides were basically between 5-10min each. There were ample food options in the park so no worries at all. Not to be missed is the Star Wars exhibition and the ninjago show. ,5.0
2424,Great visit to Legoland!,"A lot of the reviews of this place emphasise that it's ""strictly for the little ones"" but while I see their point I disagree. We are two friends in our 30s and I loved our visit! Yes, you won't necessarily find the thrill rides of other parks, but for someone who grew up with Lego and is a fan of theme parks, I'd highly recommend  Legoland Malaysia! The staff are friendly and highly attentive (in contrast to those at Hello Kitty Town for example abs even USS) and the park is well kept and well organised. There's actually a little something for everyone here- Young and old! The littlens for example probably won't appreciate the great detail and amazing likeness of Miniland, while several of the rides would appeal solely to the kids. We came in late Jan during the lunar new year festivities and appreciated the little touches and flourishes, which went all the way to some of the Miniland exhibits! For those wanting a bit of a thrill, the Dino ride is certainly the highlight and definitely edges out its rival over at USS.",5.0
2425,Great for Children but once inside everything is expensive,"Children enjoyed it but although cheaper than Legoland in Windsor UK, by Malaysian standards tickets are expensive. Once they have got you inside, everything is expensive. Pizza for lunch which would cost RM 40 at a an international chain restaurant on the high street, costs RM 81 in Legoland!Every opportunity is taken to sell you photos of you and your family again at relatively high prices.Even the Lego merchandise, which one would have thought would be slightly cheaper, having paid a lot for the entrance tickets is no cheaper than on the high street.Overall children will enjoy it but not really value for money.",3.0
2426,Fantastic family friendly fun day!,"If anyone in your family is into Lego, then this is a must! My 10 year old son loved it and is still talking about it! I'm not a fan of theme parks at all, but I am a good sport, and my son dearly wanted to go. However, I was pleasantly surprised by Legoland and liked it a lot more than Universal Studios. The staff were very helpful and there crowds were smaller. I was expecting long queues, etc, but we got there early in the morning and didn't have to queue for anything. There's plenty of great rides, a train, waterslide, 4D movie theatre and a fantastic lego souvenir shop. We loved the Lego Star Wars display, the Lego Einstein, and the Lego recreations of famous Asian places and wonders such as the Taj Mahal, Angkor Wat, Singapore and the Lego recreation of the next town on our trip - Hoi An! My son also loved the Lego themed toilets! Legoland is very family friendly and the rides are aimed at children around 12 or under, so if you are an adrenaline junkie looking for high velocity, gravity defying rides, you'll probably be disappointed. We loved the rides we went on! The staff are very helpful with taking family photos both with your camera and with their own for you to buy at the gift shop later. If you go to Legoland, be prepared for the heat. Wear light clothing and take sunscreen. On the day we went (December) the weather was very hot. However there are Lego displays that spray water mist and there is plenty of air-conditioned places indoors. My youngest son took great delight in squirting his older brother at the Singapore display! My one criticism would be the lack of free Wi-fi in the park, which meant I was unable to access email or post photos, etc, on Facebook until we got back to our hotel in Singapore. Overall though, it was a great day and well worth it!",5.0
2427,Poor ,Bought the all combo park. Which gives you access to all the parks.almost 70% of the park is build for small kids to enjoy. Only the rest is options for adult like me  the water park seriously no where compared to sunway.the Peking space they give more confusing and not taken care all at all ,3.0
2428,A great two-day visit with the children!,"We highly recommend Legoland Malaysia and the associated water park. A two-day visit will be sufficient, one day to try all the amusement rides and try your hand at mastering Lego robots, and a day to enjoy the water slides and the wave pool. A combo entrance ticket will be cheaper and will give you the freedom to chose where you want to go first (one access per day to both parks). The Lego park is more for children younger than 10, although older kids and their parents will enjoy some of the rides. Access to most of the slides in the water park is only allowed for children who are taller than 107 cm (strictly enforced for security reasons).  The staff throughout both parks was friendly, smiling and always helpful.  There are no fancy restaurants but a variety of places offering kid-friendly food and salads.",5.0
2429,Suitable for children under 12,"We stayed in Legoland hotel with my sister's family during school days for the locals. The children ages were 15, 11, 8 & 6 years old. Most of the rides are suitable for children under 12 years old who is about 110 cm tall or higher. All rides has height requirements, please check their website before deciding to go. I don't think it's worth going if your family has children under 8 as they can't go on lots of rides like my sister's 6 year old kid. A whole day at Legoland & approximately 1/2 day at waterpark is more than enough to see everything as the place was very empty & we don't have to queue for all the rides. At the time when we stay, we bought tickets from the Legoland hotel as they have special rates for hotel guests. We got 2 days unlimited entry to the parks for the price of one day ticket. For children who like to create things from scratch like master builder, this is their paradise. For other children who needs to see instruction, there were some in the 'Brain storm' stand with interesting creation. Legoland theme park is 2 minutes walking distance from Legoland Hotel.",5.0
2430,It was awesome!,"My 8 year old son and I loved our 2 day visit!  We did a day in each park, and even though it rained for most of our visit, we had a great time.  In the dry park, the Star Wars scenes were amazing to see, the rides were fun, but our favorite part was the robot lab.  We programmed our Lego robot to perform certain tasks, and it was an incredibly fun experience. The water park has a lot of great slides and you can play with large foam Legos in the lazy river.  We made a lot of great memories in those 2 days!",4.0
2431,Awesome family holiday!!!,"I'm absolutely going back again when my youngest is older! We avoided school holidays and had absolutely ZERO wait on everything.  Staying two nights was the best decision ever so we weren't rushed and managed to enjoy the hotel. Kids (6,2 & 1) had the best time imaginable.  My husband and I had a great time and wish we could ditch the kids to enjoy ourselves!!Both the water park and the theme park were great fun and we spent easily two days there.  If the kids were older maybe even longer.  Around the hotel you can easily take a cab to angry bird land (better for 6+ kids ) and Thomas, bob the builder, hello kitty land (all same place) was surprisingly entertaining so worth staying at the hotel those extra days to attend those places.We will be back for sure.",5.0
2432,Great Theme Park for Kids,"Very good theme park for kids. Many rides are kids friendly. Adults wanting to experience ""crazy"" rides, this is not for you. ",4.0
2433,It's not as hot as people claim it to be,"I had my reservations about going to Legoland especially with young children as so many friends tell me that it's very hot and uncomfortable. While it was indeed hot, there were plenty of areas which were fully air-conditioned. So you can choose to play the outdoor rides then nip into a cafe for a drink and cool down. Then head back out to the outdoor playground and when you're feeling hot again, check out some indoor attractions. There are also some areas with giant Lego animals spraying out water mist which cools down the ambient tempratuure and cools you down should you choose to stand under it. Legoland has something for everyone - the young kids and the young at heart. There were rides for young children, activities for both parents and children to do together, and rides for older kids and adults. My children really enjoyed the fire truck and water spray. While my husband and I enjoyed the Star Wars mini display. The park is just the right size. Not too big that you feel you miss out on stuff. And not too small that you explore it within the hour. All in all, we took a leisurely 6 hours in the dry park. Definitely worth a visit. ",4.0
2434,Better than I expected,"This was good and we went both parks, we took a 4 years old and a 5 months old, we were there for five hours but it wasn't enough for us. In the theme park there are some parent child activity that my kid enjoyed a lot... For the water park it was not that big but my kid enjoyed being there playing with water anyway... And there is a baby care centre at the theme park for breastfeeding, but it's quite far away from the entrance and there was only one centre, which is not too convenient. All others are good...",5.0
2435,A great day out for the family.,"Going on a 'quiet' day is a must.  Picking a day with the rest of the local schools are in really does mean that you have the park to yourself.  Also arriving around 3.30pm when everyone else is leaving, means little or waiting time.  For some of the rides we didn't even have to get off, they let us stay on and go around again.  ",4.0

2439,Fun times,"I loved the theme park and waterpark! But the miniland not so much. Im from Philippines but didnt recognize it. It rained during our stay, make sure to bring your umbrella or ponchos! Staff were very nice! Id definitely go back to Legoland Malaysia! I enjoyed it very much. ",4.0
2440,"Old, worn looking and boring","we slipped over the border from Singapore, (very easy and cheap using public transport) to go to this park, even on approach it looks a bit run down and second rate. There are many displays, and rides, but this is definitely a place for the littler travelers. Many of the rides are boring, and you can only admire so many displays of Lego ingenuity. We lasted about 90 minutes, which made it expensive. Not that good for anyone over 12.",3.0
2441,Good place to visit,"It was a good place to visit and have fun. My opinion, Legoland should add more theme park in this area. The current one are quite decent. It should be more water slides, challenging places etc.Other than that, i think this place is just fine for a happy leisure.",4.0
2442,Great time at Legoland Malaysia,"Great place with great attractions but not so great food selection. Overall, we had a great time in Legoland and my family really enjoyed all of the attractions.  What we appreciate the most was the availablibility of a variety lego block models. My children really enjoyed the waterpark features particularly lego blocks that were turned into makeshift flotila. We would definitely love to come back here again.",5.0
2443,Great time,"You have to be prepared if you wish to come here.  Wear light, comfortable walking shoes and have a hat.  Even with so many attractions, sometimes you need to que for your turn .  Waterpark is marvellous, the 4-D movie theatre, the themepark.  Adult and children will enjoy most.  Food was delicious but on the very high-end.",4.0
2444,"If you're over 6 foot, rethink going","I enjoyed Legoland. It was a fun day. My only complaint is that they made the place for the *cough* shorter type people. I'm 6""4 and couldn't ride a few of the rides because the bars couldn't get over my legs or my feet and legs literally didn't sit in the leg space. I've gone to theme parks all over the world and NEVER had this problem. ",3.0
2445,good for kids and young at heart,this place is good for the young ones they will enjoy it very much. The theme park is nice. Bot if your looking for a more adventurous place then this is not the right place for you. The rides are mostly built for kids. I love legoland because of its concept you can see lots of lego formation inside. I also love the hotel i love the theme. And i love the treasure chest game. The hotel got lots of activity inside for the kids.Legoland is a land for kids so its good if you spend time here with your kids.,5.0
2446,Legoland - worth every penny spent,"Ideal location for a family day, specially if you have kids below 12 yrs, however good for all. If not crowded 1 day is enough to cover the amusement park as well as water world. You may choose which you want to do first, we chose the amusement park & had a chance for all rides. All rides are good, dont miss visiting the miniature world its excellent.The small robotics learning centre  was the best. You can control a robot with a computer. Also across the park are Lego bricks, kids can enjoy making things they like. The staff across is very courteous and appreciate the spirit of the life guards in the water park, always ready for your safety in any weather sunshine or rain. Really great. Only area of concern is that getting veggie food is a bit difficult also cost of food is slightly expensive, however its ok & cheaper than other studios & parks I have been too.",4.0

2449,Not Just For Kids,"Going to this theme park is easy. There is a shuttle bus from JB Sentral that leaves the bus terminal with an hour intervals. Fare is just RM4.60. Drop off is at the Legoland Park itself, just a few steps to the ticket counters. Just hop on the same bus at the area where you were dropped off when getting back to JB Sentral.Park is huge. It's clean and well maintained. There are food court/stalls inside but expensive. We opted to eat at Burger King located just before the main entrance. Bring your own bottled water. I love taking free rides here as there is no queue. I love those mini-replicas of each Asian countries' famous landmarks, like Taj Mahal, Angkor Wat and so on...all are built out of Lego. Very nice!Bring an umbrella as most part of the park is not covered. There are lots of theme park personnel who are much willing to take you a picture. There is no need to bring a selfie gadget.",4.0
2450,Once is never enough,"Been wanting to visit this theme park for some time so we finally made it last month. It was a low season so not much queues to content with. Staff were nice to deal with, place was too big to do it all in one day. Besides we foolishly bought the combo tickets which includes the wet and dry parks. We didn't even go near the water park, what a shame! Yes we will come back! ",5.0
2451,Just ok..,"We go both theme park. Water theme park just nice.. Got area for young children but no so much think to play. Lego theme park, most of the thing to play must to 100cm above. But really disappointed on their show at the castle, honestly really boring.. Please improve. Other than that, it will be fun for Lego lover..",3.0
2452,Nice park but needs lots of improvements,"It's a nice park, decent rides, more suitable for younger children. My teenage kids find them too childish. The eateries are mainly western food. The park should take the opportunity to showcase some of the best local delights so that tourists or even the local can enjoy. The food are also rather expensive and nothing spectacular. There seems to be few resting areas to cool down. The location is rather remote and not well connected. One will definitely compares to the universal studio in Singapore which is much fun and more entertaining. However, it attracts the younger kids. If only there are adults rides, it will attract more people to go because we adults also want to relive or childhood dreams.",3.0
2453,Great for kids,My kids had tons of fun. Facilities were very well maintained. Its just too hot so be ready to sweat it out. Food prices are a tad higher than the usual since it's in the park and monopolised. We split 1 day for the dry park and 1 for the water park which was good for us and my kid.,5.0
2454,Good family fun,"Visited the park with  3 & 7 year old children. First impression is its ultra clean and staff very friendly.  The mini-Legoland cities were incredible. Good mix of rides for young and older kids. The only negative was the high priced photos / puzzles they wanted to sell you after most of the rides  There were a lot of food options for meals - mid priced throughout the park. The water park had a much broader age group appeal. Small, medium and high water slides. The lazy river loop worked for all ages. We did the rides in the morning and the water park in the afternoon. After 2:00, you could rent s cabana for 180 ring - $42 US.  The rent included two new embossed Legoland towels, a safe, half dozen drinks and, if needed, ""room service"". Considering rental towels are 30 each plus locker / drinks, it's not a big surcharge to have your own spot. Two full days plenty. Staying at hotel gets you in at 9:30 instead of 10:00. ",4.0
2455,Everything really IS Awesome :),Fabulous theme park combining Lego themed activities and shows with a Lego mini-land. Perfect theme park for kids with most rides accessible to younger kids.   The park is well sized to get around most of it in one day. Legoland Water Park right next door is also worth a visit. Loved it. Would definitely visit again.,5.0

My kids has lots of fun, lots of 4D theatres to see. They have new NinjaGo show as well. Really amazing trips",5.0

2461,Love legos,"Was a hot humid day, no lines middle of the week, loved been able to hop on and off the rides with minimal time to wait. Needs more shade for sure especially on such a hot day like this one, food was nice, we ate at the little resturant neat the castle, prices were average for a theme park, I was hoping to find more legos that you would not easily find in store. Prices for lego sets were the same or a little more than what you would pay in Australia. Maybe if it was a rare set I would pay for it. Lots of clothings for little kids not so much for Adults or my 12yr old. Still a great dayout.",4.0
2462,Great theme park for kids,"It's a great theme park for lego fans..especially for kids under 12 years old. You can use bus J1 or J2 from johor-sing immigration to get here. I thought its a small theme park, but I was wrong.. Even 1 day is not enough to explore alls.  Unfortunately the place is so hot, you need to use sunblock to protect your skins. ",5.0
2463,Family Visit,"Quite fun. Have been there for couple of times. The weather was quite hot, so care must be taken so that young kids are not dehydrated or have their body overwhelmed by the heat.The haze from Indonesia has been now an annual affair and has been a dampener to any outdoor amusement park in the region. So, once you have the monsoon blowing the other way, make your way to Legoland quick.",4.0
2464,Wonderful,it was an amazing experience. We visited both the water park and theme park on the same day but I recommend dedicating one day for each ... the rides are great and the atmospheres are so immersive you feel like a child no matter how old you are,5.0
2465,Everything is Awesome,"I love Lego and this is the closest Legoland I can get to in Asia. Legoland is gear towards kids but if you are an adult fan of Lego you will enjoy the theme park. The theme park has a few rides for adults and kids. It will take a few hours to complete the park and try some of the rides. The Lego model display is awesome for any photographer. I love Big Lego shop and the Lego shop where you can pick the bricks you want. The shops contain some limited edition sets and sets you cannot get anywhere else. It has a wide range of Lego keyring and create your own minifigures.If you are staying in KL or Singapore, they are express/direct bus services. Have a look at Legoland Malaysia website for more information. I caught the return bus from Legoland to Bukit Bintang in KL. Bus departed at 6:30pm and arrived at 11:30pm with a 30 minute rest stop. It was an enjoyable smooth bus ride. The coach seats are comfortable and you can easily fall asleep after a long day at the theme park.",5.0
2466,Good fun for a short family trip,"the park has enough rides to make the younger kids happy and two roller coasters for the older ones plus a few other rides. most are for 6-14 year olds though. height minimums on many rides (100cm to 120).could do with more rides but as we only had two days to spend at dry and water parks, it was good enough. the miniature cities were amazing as were the Star Wars worlds. watch Ninjago as well. besides the show, the theatre is fully air conditioned, offers respite from heat. as for playgrounds, recommend the one at Land of Imagination as that has canopies for shade. others are open to the sun and rain. Food is expensive within the park (RM28 for a plate of chicken rice) but if you are willing to trudge out and re-enter, the Medini Mall is directly outside the park and that offers KFC, Subway, Secret Recipe...water park is a bit small and manned by many, many lifeguards. it offers Cabanas for rent plus lockers. kids will love a trip to Legoland if they are theme park newbies like mine. if your kids have visited bigger more established theme parks, they may be disappointed. by the way, it's extremely hot there. really hot. and bright. so come prepared. ps: the Legoland toilets are very clean - kudos for that. ",4.0
2467,Hot splashing time.,"Well, theme park and water park is both great for the children. But can't stand the hot sun. The management of Legoland needs to provide more shades for their customers. Seriously. I am an annual premium membership, but hardly visit after 3months  because of the heat.",3.0
2468,I love LEGO but the trip was not that great,"I really love Lego minifigures and have been to some Lego Exhibitions and loved them, so I didn't care when people told me that teenagers can't really enjoy Legoland.Visited the park with my sister (teenager) and mom, and finished examining the park in less than 5 hours. We got bored eventually.We arrived at around 12 pm, and met a Legoland Character at one of the restaurants. Then, we watched two 4D movies at the studio, lots of water and bubbles, kids would probably love it but the graphics quality is not best.My personal favourite was the Star Wars Miniland, there was a movie at the entrance (which I think was great), and then Lego exhibition representing each movie and series of Star Wars.The miniland has a great collection too. However, as they were outside (as opposed to Star Wars miniland which was indoor), the lego pieces eventually got darker (due to rain, possibly?).My other plan was actually to buy some lego packs, but their collections were not that up-to-date (they didn't have the sets from Star Wars: The Force Awakens). On the other hand, you can create your own minifigures from separate parts, although there were limited options. Definitely recommend bringing umbrellas or raincoats if you plan to visit Legoland. I think this place is great for little kids.",3.0
2469,Awesome,"The rides were awesome. Highly recommended for kids. A lot of train rides, lego plays, playgrounds too. ",5.0
2470,A must do with kids,"We took young children aged 5 & 7 yrs and did an organised day trip from Singapore.  We left early in the morning and returned in the evening.  A huge day but, the kids loved Legoland and the water park.  We went on a Monday specifically to avoid any weekend crowds, great idea as we had no lines for anything. Staff at Legoland were very accommodating and allowed us to take most rides more than once as there were no people waiting. A few rides closed for maintenance but it didn't have any effect.  Several eateries had small tables that the kids could sit at and build Lego.  This was a great way for the kids and adults to have a bit of a rest before venturing on again as so much to see and do.",4.0
2471,Relive your childhood memories!,"A very interesting theme park for both young children and adults. It's so mesmerizing to see everything built with Lego pieces, I was especially intrigued with Miniland because of the precision and beauty of it all. The location is a bit out of the way though, there are direct buses available from Singapore Flyer otherwise you can also catch a bus from JB Sentral.Jungle X-pedition WILL get you soaked so bring your own poncho if you don't want to get drenched and don't want to pay for an overpriced one. A lot of the rides are built for children but you will have a lot of fun too nonetheless. There's a Star Wars Miniland which any fan would appreciate and love. We also suggest eating at Burger King outside the park.",4.0
2472,Fabulous theme park for 5 to 12 year olds,We visited the park with our 8 and 5 year olds and we had a great time. The rides were perfect for them - some were a little young - more for 3 to 4 year olds but our 5 year old enjoyed them regardless.The water park would be more suited for teenagers though my adventurous kids loved all the slides and the playground. Highly recommend.,5.0
2473,Great time here,My 3.5yo daughter really enjoyed her trip to this park. There were lots of attractions and rides that she can try. There was also a big open playground with shades. The firefighter attractions is really good for family activity as we can team up and enjoy the game together (my daughter wanted to do this over and over until my hubby got too tired lol),4.0
2474,"Great for little ones, and do the water park!","I admit, there are very few times that a mistake turned out to be a better deal. Well, this is one of them. While booking online, i made a boo-boo and booked both the dry and water park on the SAME day. If you do that for any of the other theme parks, eg. Tokyo Disneyland and Sea, it would be mad.For Legoland, it is actually do-able to both. We went there bright and early for the land. Tried all the rides, which is pretty ok, i guess, if you are  10 or below. For tweens or older, the rides are a little too tame. The highlight is actually the Star Wars exhibition - very impressive. Water park is great fun...and almost as good as Adventure Cove, minus the long lines. So, there you have it - do both parks in the same day and you will actually have a good day...even with teenagers.",3.0
2475,Kids will definitely enjoy. ,The place is really huge and most walking areas are not sheltered. It can be really scorching on a hot day. Make sure that you bring water bottles for your children. No difference from any other theme parks but children below 12 yrs will definitely have a blast. ,4.0
2476,Good experience for the little ones,"It would be a good/different/interesting experience for your children to be in a ""land full of Legos"", many activities available in both the Theme Park and Water Park, many spots for good photos too. You may want to consider two days to cover each park during peak seasons. We went during Deepavali and we covered both parks in one day as surprisingly there were not many visitors. It may do you good if you can go online and check out the attractions so you can decide which ones to skip based on the age of your children. My teenage kids already planned which rides to go for, so they did not waste time at the park. They even repeated several times on the rides they enjoyed. My 7-year old daughter enjoyed herself with many activities too (the little ones will have plenty to do). The whole family had fun.   ",5.0

2479,Awesome!,"We had an awesome time here and was fortunate with the weather being overcast with some showers so it was not too hot. The park was quiet at that time of the year (19-20 Jan) and there was no queues for the rides. We got to do a few rounds of all the rollercoasters.If going to the water park as well, a stay overnight at the Legoland Hotel is worthwhile as you can get change and leave all your other belongings in your room. We also got to do the slides a few times. Did more in the 2 half days at Legoland than we ever did on 3 visits to  the theme parks on the Australian Gold Coasts during peak periods.  ",5.0
2480,Fun but Tiring,"Timing and Rides We decided to go during Christmas. Huge mistake! The place was over crowded and queues were ridiculously long. We had to queue up one and a half hours to two hours per ride. Queueing area was stuffy and warm, eventhough there are fans. But, the rides were awesome and fun. I just dislike long queue and wasting my time just for a ride. We only managed to go on 4rides as my child was below the recommended height for most rides... If you have a child below 100cm, there are very limited rides but its still fun. However, try not to visit during peak seasons unless you dont mind waiting more than an hour for each ride.FoodWe had our food at their Market restaurant. There are a varieties of food to choose from. Food tasted good but a bit pricey. Portion was in good size. No complaints here.WashroomThere are not much washroom around this place. Since we went during peak season, the queue was long and it was difficult if you had a toddler who has to ""hold it in"" for close to about 10 -15minutes whenever she goes to the bathroom. LegosThere are several shops here that sells Legos. I love the shop that sells loose Legos and you get to pick and choose the ones you like. Once you are done, the staff would help you to weigh it. There are shop discounts and promotions but not as much as I hope it was. But there are wide varieties to choose from.What to bring/wearI would advise you to bring/wear the following:-1. Water (each bottle of water cost RM5/bottle)2. Big umbrella (the golf type, you will be walking outdoors, so be it sun or rain, it comes in handy)3. Handheld fan (if you have a toddler this will help to ease them, cos it gets pretty stuffy while you are waiting in the long queue)4. Comfortable walking shoes (you will be doing a lot of walking. I mean A LOT of walking. Unless you dont mind walking up and down the terrains in your high heels, go ahead)5. Cap (if you dont want to use the umbrella under the hot sun this is a good alternative, but it wont shield you from the rain, just saying)Photo Taking and SouvenirsOnce you reached the place with tonnes of popular mini landmarks, there are photographers waiting to take your pictures. You could get the pictures printed out at the shop near the entrance once you are done for the day. My advice is that, you stick to the same photographer so that, you could retrieve your pictures easily later on. If you really cant get the same photographer, remember the place and time you take those pictures, so that, the staffs could help you to trace the pictures. It took some time for them to retrieve all the pictures we took with several photographers. Thats why, sticking with one photographer is the better and easier option. I highly recommend getting the brick wall. Its where they print your picture on a brick wall made of Lego. Its pretty cool seeing your photo on Legos. And how often do you get to have your pictures printed on Legos? They have several combos as to how many pictures you would like to get and so on. The staffs are friendly and very helpful. I would visit again, but this time, during low season. ",4.0
2481,Lego fun for the whole family.,"Our recent vacay included a trip to JB from Singapore to Legoland. It's better to fly to Singapore rather than KL as JB is a stone throws from it.  We stayed at the Legoland resort which is a must if you want to enjoy the park. Convenient if you've young kids and want to take a break, nap etc. The kids loved the resort as it offered themed rooms. We stayed in the adventure themed room that could accomodate 5 (2 adults, 3 kids). The lobby is a Lego enthusiasts dream come true with several pits of Lego. Our kids loved building plus dancing with other kids on the X box that's also in the lobby. The hotel offers only two restaurants ""bricks"" which is buffet and the other an Italian one. Buffet breakfast is generally included in the room charge. Bear in mind that this resort caters for kids and the food is kids friendly ergo not sophisticated at all. I tried the bbqed prawns and they hadnt even deveined it!!! The park itself is perfect for kids from the ages of 3-12. If you've older kids i wouldn't recommend this theme park. My kids enjoyed all the rides although it was stinking hot. They do need to put more shade and trees. We enjoyed our visit because there were no crowds and the kids could go again and again. So, try avoiding school holidays in Singapore/Malaysia and weekends as it gets rather crowded then.",4.0
2482,Great for younger kids not suited for teenagers or adults ,There are great things about legoland. First if you go during the week there are no lines . The park bathrooms and restaurants are completely spotless . And the staff is friendly and helpful. Gifts are reasonably priced especially if your using the Singapore dollar. The bad thing is there are few rides that adults could ride . I'm 5'11 with healthy  sized thighs . I was a foot taller than the average adult there riding with kids . I got on one ride and a thought there goes my head . There was only two rides I felt comfortable riding without a kid. Although the staff was very accommodating. I went with tour group tour east . I got there at 10am left at 5 pmI could have left at 3 and seen and done everything. ,3.0

2484,Trip for the kids to enjoy,"Checked into Lego land Malaysia for 3 nights. We booked the pirate themed room. The room was comfortable with a bunk bed and a trundle bed for the 3 girls and a comfortable double bed for the adults. Easily accommodate 5 people. There is also a treasure hunt for the kids and a very nice surprise at the end.The food at the bricks restaurant and the Italian restaurant was good. The bricks offered a buffet style menu with a good variety of Malaysian and western food. Food was well marked to inform people with any special food requirements. The brick restaurant also had a table cover to allow the family to colour in between dinner. The Italian restaurant had a good range of Italian food. We settled for pizzas for the family. Pizzas were much larger in sizes than what we expected, so do not over order.We found all the staff to be very helpful and polite. They seemed to be very focused on making sure the kids were enjoying themselves. This was a positive in keeping the family happy.They have several Lego pits and a play station area in the lobby area. This kept the adults and kids entertained the whole night .Only negative about the stay for the poor wifi in the rooms, we had to go to the local shops and buy a SIM card to get good wifi. Overall the stay was fun and enjoyed by the whole family. ",4.0

2487,Must for every kid over 5,"There are two parts to the attraction, the Legoland and Water Park. Each can take 2-4 hours. Innovative and thrilling in a personal experience for kids of all ages, preferably accompanied by an elder,; So for the water park carry your trunks/swim suit. Cabana's can be hired for the day. Legoland is really very nice with all the models in Lego, buy Lego packages, get the thrill to Drive a car, steer a boat, ride a train, enjoy the roller coasters, them all. Entry tickets Seniors get a discount, combo to both is cheaper .We stayed at Puteri Harbour, (15 mins), the hotel had a free shuttle to Legoland, the advantage was that we saw Hello Kitty and other attractions in the afternoon of our  arrival(3 hours) and had the next day to first enjoy Water park (2 hrs) visit Legoland (3 hrs), Very Comfortable having spaced out the activity. I wonder if Legoland hotel gives free shuttle to see Hello Kitty, Nice , enjoyable for 5-9 yr olds.",5.0

2491,A good amusement park for kids between 3 to 15,"We visited here with two kids. Our youngest was infant so it was mainly a fun time for our three year old. We visited outside the school holiday season from Singapore, so the queues to the attractions were no longer than 10 mins in the heat. There were some 'mild' adventure rides for the adults but dont expect anything to the level of Universal Studio. At the end of the day, its Legoland :)There were numerous activities - as our kid was young we went to Driving School, Boating School, some fire engine game (can be played by one to two kids with two parents), many rides, 4D movies galore, Lego technic room, etc, etc.The food were relatively cheap for theme park (comparing to HK Disneyland, Universal Studio in Singapore). I would suggest for the young kids, go to Lego City first, then Lego Kingdom. If it rains, you can visit the Big Lego store, Star Wars attraction, and the 4D movies or Ninjago attractions are all indoors.  For older kids, I cant comment but some of the rides my daughter couldnt go on because she was too short.",4.0

Had the boat ride and the races in the fire truck and police truck. And what was best was no waiting for half and hour. The Star Wars show was truly AWESOME loved it heaps of photos. If you go on the Log ride wear bathers or a waterproof pancho otherwise like my family were drowned rats. And all the lego buildings where great and really  well layed out. Only down side we found out was to buy something it was lego keyring , lego hats  not one postcard which we found a little disappointing.",4.0
2494,Perfect for our family,"We went to Legoland in Malaysia last week (in mid-Jan) and it was the perfect theme park for my family. There was a really good amount of rides for my 5 and 7 year olds providing the perfect amount of 'thrill'. I think it is a park for 4 to 12 (or even 14) year olds. While it as hot in the park at this time of year we didn't have to wait AT ALL for any of the rides and even got to go around on some rides a number of consecutive times because there was no one waiting.The staff were lovely and it had a relaxed feel to the place.The water slides were awesome and once again there were heaps of slides that were perfect suited for my aged kids. Plus the big wave pool was a great way to cool off.The Ninjago show (inside and air conditioned) was fabulous.Regarding getting there, we planned to take the 8.30am WTS bus from the Singapore Flyer but upon arriving there at 7.45am we were told it was booked out so make sure you book online the day (or sooner before). With the next bus at 9.30am we decided to make our own way there so we got a taxi to Bugis (the Queen Street Bus Terminal) and got a Malaysian Taxi from there to Legoland. It was about AUD$70 each way and really easy.While Google Maps and all the websites say the distance from Singapore city to Legoland is approx. 50 mins it actually takes about 1.5hrs because you need to clear both the Singapore and Malaysian borders / immigration so don't forget your passports",5.0
2495,legoland what a star!!,we had an amazing day at legoland for the entire family.We went midweek and there was no wait times.often our kids went around again as there was no one waiting.Food is well priced and all the rides and attractions are fantastic. our kids are 8  and 10 and completed almost all rides.It was clean and great fun.I would recommend this place to all!,5.0
2496,Hot but fun!,Came on a weekday in January 2016. Place was relatively empty given that it is the start of the year and children are mostly in school. Came with a toddler and infant. Not many sheltered places but everything was within a 5-7 min walk from one attraction to another. Try dining at the 'Medieval Kingdom' section - the chicken family meal was quite a good deal. Did not visit the watermark but will try in the future. ,4.0
2497,It is crowdedness ,"Kids enjoyed there no waiting lines the played freely with no waiting pressure, I recommend to where a very light cloths with sandals to enjoy the water park too ",3.0
2498,Wonderful Time,"Where do you start.  It's everything and more than you expect or want.  This is a great place for kids aged 3-10ish plus their mum and dads.  It has rides for younger and older kids including some our nine year old loved, which gave his parents the heebie jeebies.  Everything is accessible and well managed in a wonderfully landscaped environment. When we went (2-day pass on a Sunday and Monday) the park was quiet and we were able to walk right into the rides and virtually straight on.  Many times we were also offered the opportunity to 'go again?'The shows are also worth going to if you get the timing right.We spent half the first day going around 2/3rds of Legoland and spent the afternoon in the water park (slides, wave pool and float around on inflatable rings circuit), which is also worth the entrance fee.  Then we spent 2/3rds of the second day going around what we didn't see in the park the first day and re-visiting all the favourite rides (the scary fast ones) before heading back to the hotel to leave.Would recommend a three-day, two-night stay at the Legoland Hotel with a combined two-day pass to Legoland and the water park.We visited Legoland in the UK a couple of years ago and this compares well.  It's a bit smaller, but the rides and other activities are more accessible and getting wet in the UK leaves you feeling cold for the rest of the day, whilst the one in Malaysia cools you down.Would definitely go again.",5.0
2499,HIGHLIGHT OF THE HOLIDAY,Awesome theme park. We didn't have to cue for any rides and the staff even allowed the rides to go again if no one was waiting. Friendly staff and food was very reasonably priced. Rides for all ages and great water park to cool down.,5.0
2500,Great for kids,"I visited Legoland with my wife and 3 kids (11 years, 7 years and 3 years). We had previously been to Legoland in Orlando and this park has similar rides and themes. It is a fantastic experience for kids between the ages of 5 and 12. Any older they would probably prefer Universal Studios instead.Pros- The park is quite easy to get around and wasn't very busy - even though we went on a Sunday.- There are a number of food outlets with a variety of food and its not expensive. They even have little Lego tables so kids can build models while the food is being prepared.- Mind storm is fantastic. if its forecast to rain, make sure you are near Mindstorm when the rain starts so you can spend a while in there while the rides are closed.- The kids loved getting their drivers license at the driving school - highlight of their day.- Building your own lego characters was a treat - you get to build 3 for RM33Cons- Very hot and not much shade- Toilets are few and far between- Probably the biggest complaint I have is that entry is charged for 3 year olds, however there aren't many rides they get get on. My 3 year old was only allowed on Beetle Bounce, Duplo train and Driving School. She wasn't even allowed on the jousting horses as she was deemed too young. If Legoland is going to charge entry for 3 year olds they need to have more rides suitable for them - or alternatively only charge for 4 year old and above.it is a great way to spend a day. We travelled from Singapore on a shuttle bus. I would recommend this over renting a car - as immigration queues at the border are lot shorter in the buses section as opposed to those for cars. We left Singapore at 8:30 and were in Legoland by 10 and on the way back, we left at 5:30 and were back in the hotel by 7.",4.0
2501,Excellent park,Attended with a family. An amazing park with great rides and facilities. We got a two park (theme and waterpark) pass. I'd say you can't really do two in one day. As the price is reasonable we purchased both. You need a whole day just to see the displays and rides. We were lucky to walk into every ride immediately and still didn't get through the whole park. A 30 min splash in the water park us all we had time for. Wet travelled from Singapore which took a while with immigration. Both Malaysia and Singapore have the slowest systems of passport checking for foreigners. If you travel out if Singapore you'll need to complete the red immigration card. Try to get these before you go and fill them out so you don't get left doing it on the bus ride. Leave on the early bus 08:30 out of the Singapore flyer to get to the park for opening. A great family day out.  ,5.0
2502,When Creativity Meets Sophisticated Architecture Designs,"This is one of the place that could really amaze me :-D What a remarkable creativity, amazing details, the architecture of the miniatures were designed meticulously and my sons were really excited with these outstanding work of arts and my oldest son is a Lego lover !! My son could learn that even from a small piece of Lego you can build a very sophisticated architecture... all it takes were perseverance and creativity :-) so if you're looking for a whole different experience with your family, then this would be the right place to visit :-D ",5.0
2503,Entertaining and unforgettable one,"Tips for tourist or first timer:1. Buy ticket online. Discount available up to 20%. Johorian or local people born in this state entitled a special price. 2. Contact tourist agent. They have  complete package at a very reasonable price (including accommodation, transportation and perhaps meal)3. Plan your journey. It is advisable to reach this theme park before 10am. enjoy your local breakfast 1st. 4. Bring mineral water , avoid dehydration. Otherwise spend your money here. I like pizza served in one of the restaurant. It's so yummy5. Plan your visit.. perhaps during weekend, one day is not enough. Need to queue and perhaps u'll missed some games or attractions. . Maybe combo ticket if available is the best solution.6. There are homestay available nearby this area. Search in website. A good choice for a family. Otherwise u have to spend more on hotels.Overall, I really like this theme park. I enjoyed collect the miniatures, taking pictures and enjoyed the games. I have been here twice since its opening. Wish I can visit this park again :)",5.0
2504,Awesome resort. Awesome themepark for young children.,Stayed at the resort for couple nights. Room was quite dear for Malaysian standard but it was worth it. Family room has got bunk beds and a king size. You have got 5 star breakfast buffet and 1/2 hour earlier entry at themeparks. Location of the hotel and both themeparks are next to each other so that you can get in and re entry at your owm convenient. There is also a small mall next to it so that you can have cheaper lunch in the mall than inside the themepark. Highly recomended if you are taking children under 12. Both my daughters were enjoying it to the max.,5.0
2505,Waterpark fantastic! ,Went to the waterpark which was fantastic. Great toddler pool and lazy river was good. My 5 year old loved the slides she was tall enough to go on and my son loves racing the boats. We got in for a cheaper price as went in afternoon! ,5.0
2506,Good for kids,"This Legoland is not so big, when compare to the one in the US.  Staff are very nice and they even helped us to give a birthday surprise to my friend. The rides in there are mainly for kids so adults might not feel excited when they play the ride. Legoland is quite far away from the kuala lumpur and i think it's better to come here from singapore.",4.0
2507,Fun for kids,"Will be best enjoyed and appreciated by kids between the ages of 5 and 12. The water park is awesome and can be enjoyed by all ages. Don't expect any adrenaline rush on the water slides as the slides are slow. Only problem with the water park is that they is no place to chill and relax. You have to leave your belongings on a plastic chair.  If you are planning to do both the theme and water park, do them on separate days.",5.0
2508,Disappointing!,"Legoland was on our travel itinerary from the day we planned to travel to Malaysia. Unfortunately we did not do enough research into how best to get to Legoland and had relied on there being coaches and tours available to tourists. If you are planning on going to Legoland, Malaysia, my advice would be to buy your tickets online and preferably before you leave home. We tried (unsuccessfully) to purchase tickets online, with our hotel internet and the website would not allow us access at all. We had to contact family at home and get it booked that way. The Legoland bus service from Kuala Lumpur was horrendous to book. After unsuccessfully attempting to book the ONLY service available to us to get to Legoland several times on their website and getting the hotel concierge to help us, they told us the only possible way to book this service was online. AGAIN, we had to call home and ask them to book us tickets to get onto the bus. We traveled by coach to Legoland for 3 and a half hours non stop with a 30 minute stop. Once at Legoland, we had an enjoyable day, however most of the attractions are for young children, there is hardly any attractions for adult guests. There is limited eating areas and if you intend to do both the water park and the dry park it is best to do a two day journey. We completed our day in only a few hours as we only intended to do the dry park and were left with no choice but to wait until the coach picked us up at 6:30! The park itself had closed at 6pm! We didn't reach Kuala Lumpur again until 11:30pm which made for a very long and tedious day. The loaction of the park is not ideal for tourists, which I assume would be a big part of their target audience? The limited transport to get to the location was abysmal and the support we received from the Legoland online support was very unhelpful. Long story, short we won't be visiting Legoland, Malaysia again.",2.0
2509,For Adults Also,"It was a great experience. The water park is the best, get to experience all the rides. I suggest you go through the water park first because in instances of rain they will close the park so better do them all first before going to other parks. I was amazed by the miniland miniature prototypes of 17 different Asian countries, it is really a masterpiece. For the thrill seekers, I recommend the Project X, it was really a very exciting experience. If you have enough time, enjoy the 4D movies at Lego Studio. Show is every after 30 minutes. Go there on a weekday so you don't have to queue to your favorite rides.",4.0
2510,Entertaining for kids and hot,"We visited in January with 3 young kids ( all under 6). Having read reviews that legoland is virtually no fun if it rains , I was a bit nervous. Since its still rainy season in SEA, I'd imagined it would be wet , but to our surprise it's hot! ( really hot ... imagine Texas or Shanghai in the summer time ... its the kinda hot that pierced your skin) , so please come armed with sun hats , caps , and  put on sunscreens. Bring cold water bottles ( they never inspect our bags or anything).We came in the morning because some friends told us it tends to rain around 2-4pm. We got lucky that day because it only drizzled for 30 minutes around 3pm. The day before , it was raining hard ( I asked the staff ) around 3pm ( see the pattern). Tips : Bring rain coats for kids. My children really enjoyed their day at legoland , we left shortly before the theme park was closed. Having said that , note that the attractions were mostly targeted for younger kids. If you have older kids and they are not really into Lego , maybe this park is not worth going. Try going to angry bird park if you're visiting Johor instead.Will we come back? Probably , for the kids' sake. and this time round, we'd be sure to bring some caps ! ( the caps they sell at legoland is so basic and expensive !!! we were so forced to buy.) We would come close to lunch time , have lunch at the restaurant and get our picture with legoman taken , then head on to the rides ;) By the way , when we were there, there were not many people , no queue for the rides. I couldn't imagine if the park was crowded, our experience would be totally different and we'd probably won't come back! Tips : At least if you could , go when the local school kids are at school ^^.",4.0
2511,Did not disapppint!,"My husband and I along with our two children aged 9 and 7 recently travelled from Singapore to Malaysia LEGOLAND for the day.  The bus trip is 2 hours each way with 2 stops each way for passport control, so it is a big day (possibly a bit much to do in one day for little kids?) but my kids managed OK.  LEGOLAND itself did not disappoint.  Miniland is the section with all of the huge lego monuments/scenes which was great.  There were even boats, buses and cars that moved around within the scene!  The Star Wars section was awesome - with 6 rooms, each dedicated to a different planet from Star Wars and with elaborate set ups involving huge Lego Star Wars ships etc.  Each set up was interactive, kids being able to press buttons to make the figures fight or the ships take off.  We did some of the rides which were good fun too.  Food options were good, we even managed to get our kids a healthy salad roll for lunch which I thought was great at a place like that where it is usually only junk food.  One of the best aspects was that after about Jan 4th the Singaporean and Malaysian kids are back at school so we had the place almost to ourselves which meant no queues at all for rides or exhibits!!!  So good.We then went to the lego Water Park next door which was heaps of fun - lazy river, waterslides, wave pool.  All in a all a great day - my 7 year old son who is totally obsessed with lego and esp Lego Star Wars said it was the best day of his life!",5.0
2512,Kids heaven,"This is my 2nd time to go here, not so much change in here, but my kids still love to go here. My kids favourite is ninjago show, starwars show and 4d show..Please more improve the park so the variant will more to choose for kids",4.0
2513,1st visit,Our 1st visit to legoland was awesome because we went on a non peak season weekday. There fo we were able to enjoy all the facilities games of both wet and dry park without Q.1. Weather is hot but windy. Best bring cap & umbrella. Water is a MUST there is no free refill inside both DRY and WET park.2. Umbrella is usefull if ur car is parking at zone 1 as the last part walking distance to car park area is open non covered. Btw parking fee is rm10 per entry. Touch n go / cash notes.3. Cash only for food which ranges from rm18 to rm35 per set meal.4. The games all are free expect some small kiosk type.5. Children Min height 100cm is required for most games.6. Must see new attraction is live action Ninjago show at lego city stage.7. Water park locker is pricey compare sunway's rm20 small locker / rm30 big locker.8. No glasses T-shirt watches if u wan full enjoy of water park games.9. Beach area if add in sand that would be more real and fun. Eg. Sunway's.10. Overall good experience for us small family,4.0
2514,An awesome place for young ones!,"After 8 visits to Legoland in a span of 4 months  I am happy to say that Legoland has become the get away place for my kids.  The best part about legoland is the variety of rides they have to offer and the fact that even my 4 year old could enjoy almost all the rides,  barring a few due to height restrictions.  The Live Ninjago Show is one to watch and also the 4D Movie show.  Carry an extra pair of clothes if you don't like walking around in wet clothes after the Dino Island ride (but please don't miss the ride).The water park is really awesome and you can easily spend the day there as well.They have lots of lockers around the park and water park so do not worry about your belongings or things you must lug around.The park has many options for your meals so you can pick a different outlet for each meal.Have fun with your little ones here its a lovely place.  P.S,  The place does get sunny during the day.  Don't forget to pack your Sun Hats and Sunscreen!",5.0
2515,Superb!,Visited legoland in january. had a splendid time along with family and yound children. the theme park is a very colorful place filled with many rides to cater both adults and younglings.The park is in 2 divisions one is the adventure park while the other is the water park and both require a day each to fully enjoy them. the park opens at 10am and closes at 6 so its ample time to roam around.If you are travelling with children under 4 years old you should know most of the rides are for children above 90 cm while a few are for above 120. I had to stay back in a few being with a three year old.A few rides do let the children in with an adult. However there are a few rides specifically for children under 5 like small cars and planes. also many small lego play areas with slides and different structures of playing for babies and toddlers.Due to the scorching sun all year round its suggested to wear sun-block and hats or glasses. but on reides like the roller coasters they dont allow you to take your bags or anything along. there are lockers provided to keep all the belongings.the waterpark doesnt have many things to do but all areas are nicely built. All the rest rooms and changing rooms in the facility are super clean lots of changing rooms so you wouldnt have to wait for your turn. Towels can be rented (30 ringetts for the towel and an additional 20 for security deposit) so better take your own towels along.,5.0
2516,Good visit for kids,Visited this place and was able to see everything within a day despite having hard rain.  Rides are mostly for kids so it would bore people who are looking for thrills. I recommend you to watch their ninjago show.  It was something interesting. Wasn't able to go to the pool side but that would add adventure to the kids if you want.  :) ,3.0
2517,A theme park with cash preferred,"I went to LEGOLAND in Nov 2015 with 4 adults and 1 child from Singapore. We have limited MYR cash with us as we do not want to have too much cash on us while we go around actively in the park. We were caught unaware that in LEGOLAND, all the purchase on that day was by cash. ->It is unacceptable for a world class theme park to have no back up in the system. Were told to get the cash out of the ATM machine in the next room. It makes me wonder what is happening in the system of LEGOLAND if the ATM system next to the counter could work but not their internal system. it was such a hassle, and not all of us have credit card that we can withdraw such an amount of money , about 1200 ringgit for entrance and additionally another amount for food and souvenirs. it would be appreciated to have set up the multi currency acceptance as back up. just like in certain store and supermart, they would accept foreign currency with the exchange rate displayed. SO beware, better to bring CASH and make urself cash ready. The facilities for the baby is a good idea and well appreciated for rest and replenishing, stroller are to be parked outside the entrance. However, being a tropical country, it would rain. Guess what happened, the roof of this entrance is that small that maybe one stroller would be protected from the rain. If the stroller were to be moved to the next adjoining building, it would be WET because it is an adjoining building but not an adjoinind roof.these are small improvement that could be amended in yearly maintenance however, they have opened for more than 2 years and yet to be amended.  Maybe the mgmt. of LEGOLAND has to really walk the ground during rainy days too.We also made a yearly pass for 2. interestingly there was only badge given. it would be appreciated to provide some simple gifts or even stickers for children below certain age. so don't expect too much from the annual membership from LEGOLAND. we enjoyed the free wheelchair on first come first serve. but take note that the queue for some family friendly attractions did not have access for wheelchair. So, pls queue the long queue if you are on wheelchair, meaning very likely to give up if you could not really stand or walk.",3.0
2518,Great for 6 to 10 year olds,"Good: A great park to spend about 4-6 hours on many rides, and explore different lego worlds.  This is not an expensive theme park to visit by world standards. The hotel is outrageously expensive, and there is little benefit in staying there.  Stay in Singapore, or if you don't want a long trek and want to save money - then pick a good hotel in nearby Johor Bahru.  (Malaysia is a much cheaper country than Singapore).Bad: This park is not suitable for 11+ year olds.  They will be very bored, very quickly.  There are a couple of roller coasters and a log flume that would interest older kids looking for a thrill.Food:  For a theme park, the food is very reasonably priced, and our bags were not checked for outside food/drinks when we came in.Hotel:  Staying 1 night is enough, with 2 being the absolute maximum necessary.  This park is honestly not big enough to warrant more than 2 days of visit.Tip: Go during the week, and its almost empty.  Zero queues when we visited in January.Lego?  Yes - they sell lego.  A good variety you would not find at most shops, but at standard prices.",4.0
2519,not enough for 1 day,"try the waterpark, get more than an adrenalin, fun and excitement.. perfect combination of water and lego. feel save with a life guard in every where u go, more than enough facility for kids to play and swim.the themepark is HOT and need more than 1 day to explore, so much fun to play and the adventure of LEGO is everywhere..you can play with parents to.. many games need your colaboration with your kids.",5.0
2520,Excellent for families,"I never expected Legoland to be as fun to tell you the truth. I have been to 6 Flags in US, Universal Studios and Disneyland(s) BUT with the prevailing currency exchange and short time frame for a break we decided on visiting the Theme Park in JB :) We passed by the area when the park first opened a few years back but this would be our 1st visit to the park. I am totally impressed with the layout, the staff, cleanliness and how it is so well put together. Granted we were there after the local school hols so it was pretty well spaced out with other holiday makers so we did not have to wait in line at all for the rides and stuff. One thing we were super impressed with was with the Japanese style puppet show they had. WOW! I really was not expecting it to be that good! Great work to all the people involved in making it all happen.The water park was equally fun as well. One would really need to stay in the hotel, take a full leisurely day at the theme park and another half day at the water park the next day. It is a full experience we all thoroughly enjoyed. I am so proud and happy to know that we really do have such a world class theme park in our own backyard!",5.0
2521,You should go to this one!,"I think you will very enjoy this you make it in 2 days cause there is a nice Water Park, and if you make it into a day make sure to put Water Park 3 hours before you go back, so you can enjoy your trip. :)",4.0

2523,Good and compact theme park,"Especially like the new Star War exhibition. Everything was attention to details! However the weather was bad that day with raining all day long. As it was not a weekend, therefore the park was not packed with goers, therefore the waiting time was quite short. If you are going to the Water Park, please be recommended to take your own towels if possible otherwise you will need to pay for towels. Overall restaurants inside was good though the price was fair. Just missed the ride for Project X, which I considered should the top attraction there.",4.0

2525,Right place for family to have fun,"LEGOLAND Malaysia Resort brings together a LEGOLAND Park, Water Park and Hotel in one LEGO themed location.

Almost everything is hands-on, so you can push, pedal and program, or steer, squirt and splash, your way through a truly interactive experience ‚Äì and of course there‚Äôs building too.",5.0
2526,An experience of good value away from Billund!,"First visited in Nov'14 and stayed at the hotel for 1 night. We got the 2D1N hotel+theme park package and upgraded our tickets to an annual pass at just another Rm80 more per person. The hotel stay was a good experience as all aspects of the hotel encapsulated the Lego concept and design. My son loved the secret challenge that we had to solve to get a secret prize found in the room. Our package comes with a 2 day ticket for the theme park (includes water theme park) so we had ample time to have fun. The theme park is dissected into 5 main categories which is in line with a few of Lego's main concepts i.e City, Duplo, Castle, Technic and Dinosaurs. Throughout the park, there are rides/games/displays from other products like Star Wars, Classic and Ninjago. My son loved the City rides as he gets to indulge in real physical fun in driving a car, steering a boat, flying a plane, driving a police car and saving a fire. The theme park are quite strict in ensuring minimum height/age restrictions are met before allowing the kids to take the rides so I think this is a good thing as the park actively exhibit their responsibility to ensure all visitors have a safe and good time. Overall, the theme park is not as huge as Disneyland or the original LEGOLAND in Billund but there are sufficient rides and games for Lego fans (young and old) to enjoy. If not, the Lego Shop is a great place to shop for exclusive Lego items/toys including special editions not easily available in local retail shops. It is probably the biggest Lego store in S.E.A. Annual pass holders get complimentary parking although day ticket holders only need to pay Rm10/entry. Usual theme park F&B outlets are found across both parks but just 2 mins outside the parks, is the Medini Mall which is a very small mall but thankfully consists of mainly F&B outlets at half of the park's F&B prices. The only gripe we had was that the park didn't have enough shade or trees to ""cool"" down the place since the park is located in a sparse newly developed area. The water theme park is pretty standard although most rides are not suitable for children younger than 5 years. Because of our annual pass, we went back at least 5 times since the first time and enjoyed ourselves even though we are very familiar with the place by then. ",4.0
2527,Unbelievably Disappointed!,"We arrived off the bus from Singapore at 10.00 (Jan 2016) and by 11.30 we were done. I wouldn't call this place a Theme park at all! The rides were un-amusing and the laser gun ride very basic and cheap. There were a few Lego sculptures around the place, nothing amazing. The atmosphere seemed really awkward, Staff would chatter, spend time on their phones, and wouldn't acknowledge you at all. We went to the Star Wars video only to have two staff members chatting and giggling in the background. Hours on hours were spent at the Lego building room trying to amuse ourselves until the bus came back at 5.00pm.  The only highlight of the day was the Lego puppet show at the end of the day. ",1.0
2528,Kids and Adults will love it!,"This is something the entire family will enjoy especially the waterpark. The themepark is a little limited so swing for the waterpark entrance instead if you can't splurge on both tickets.  Try to avoid visiting when there is strong rain because the lifeguard will ask you to step away into dry land esp when there is lightning.  Imagine a hoard of people standing around in the rain waiting for the rain to pass.  Even if the rain passes, it may take awhile for the lifeguards to let you back in so check the weather :)",4.0

The park is huge indeed, and one will need more than a day to finish it all (I entered Theme Park at 10 am and left at 7.30pm!) We did not managed to enter the Water Park due to the time constraint.Food is expensive, my advice go to the nearest mall and grab your food before you enter Legoland.Overall, I would say kids will enjoy it more than adults.",4.0
2531,Great Holiday at Legoland,"I visitied Legoland with my family after the peak-season, so It was really good for not having long-queue.The weather is so hot, wearing umbrella or hat is very recommended.When visiting Legoland, I recommend to spend at least 10 hours to enjoy all the rides there.Food and drinks can be easily found at affordable price.Legoland can be reached around 30-minutes drive from the city center of Johor Bahru.",5.0

2535,Decent but not mind-blowing,"First, let me say i'm writing this review from the perspective of someone coming up from Singapore. We were lucky we got to Legoland from Orchard Road in less than an hour. No queue at the Singapore and Malaysia immigration line. Coming back took about 2 hours. THis was Dec 30, 2015First, the Lego pieces. The park features some very nice pieces made with the bricks: from a container ship to airport to Star Wars pieces from all 6 episodes. These were nice to look at, but after a while, the novelty dies down, as you can only look. They should have sold limited edition sets of the displays that you can take home with you and build if you want.Next, the attractions. The rides are more kid-oriented and not hardcore theme park rides which are fine for young children. Some of the attractions had a minimum age like 8 years old. There is very little shade all around and the sun can be scathing.Food was very basic. If you're a burger and pizza person you should be ok. Otherwise, very little variety on the offerings after those.The driving school was good for kids, as they learned how to read traffic signs and went out on the track for a run around.They had Ninjago live which was interesting at first then got tiring. They have 4D shows but not much different from what you can see if other theme parks.Others have said the Lego hotel was interesting but we just did a day trip. Overall would have been a good way to spend a few hours in the park, but the travel time to and from Singapore would probably keep me from going back again",3.0
2536,"Great, but I've seen better","Legoland Malaysia is not bad, owing to the fact that it is just 15 min's drive away from where I stay, and the fact that I hold an annual premium pass. The attractions were great, but it is lacking in thrill rides. The only rides that I find thrilling on the theme park was the Dragon Coaster, Lego Technic and Dino Island. The rest of the rides are somewhat too ""kiddy"" for me. The water park, however, is generally good. I find it comparable to Sunway Lagoon. Anyway, the best thing that I enjoyed was the short queue time. As I usually visit at unusual times with my pass (during weekdays, working days, off-peak time), the queue are usually short.",4.0
2537,Kids found their heaven,"We have spent a full sunny day here. It was full because my kids were happy and enjoyed it alot since they are lego fans. During our visit, it was hot sunny day, not much trees yet so bring umbrella or hat. Because it was holiday season there were long standing queue line, so we tried VIP package with private guide so kids didnt have to queue for too long and can enjoy all atractions.The place is not too big, come there early in the morning so One day is enough for visit and finish all atractions. Better buy tickets online so you can save up 25%. ",4.0
2538,Great fun day,"Visited legoland during our Singapore trip. It`s closer to the Singapore border. The private driver took us to Legoland within 1,5hours.I purchased the combo family tickets online. The price was really fair, 460 ringgit. You can save time and money also, if your purchase your tickets online. As december was rainy season, specially at the afternoon, we started our fun day in the legoland waterpark. The waterpark is ok. Nothing really special, but nice to chill out. Please preoare to have cash with you, if you wan to rent a locker or towel. Food and beverages can be purchased by credit cards,The legoland part is really clean and well maintatined. We visited the park on Wednesday during school hours, was empty. No waiting time for the games. Park has several restaurant, offering good food selection for really cheap. Legoland is much more fun for kids above age 6, but my 4 years old son loved the lego playground. The lego strore is OK. Nothing special or no unique selection. Even pricewise is the same level. Of course you have to buy something as you exit the park. Overall nice experience. Prepare for the heat and humidity.",4.0
2539,Wow,"I didnt know as a grown up, i too would enjoy Legoland.Went into the theme park all day... so many rides and things to do with your kids. Even in the hot hot sun... I still managed to bring my family all over. Due to our time constraints... we didn't enter the Water Park. Next time around we will definitely be getting ourselves wet in tht section.A must go for families and children below the age of 12 would go crazy there!",5.0
2540,Cool if you love lego or have kids 5 - 10yrs,"I was actually impressed how quick the travel time is from Singapore to Legoland in JB.  Only 90mins from Singapore Flyer to Legoland in Malaysia and that includes the immigration processing leaving Singapore and the processing to arrive into Malaysia. (but probably dependent on traffic and queues)   The rides are cool for children and there are lots of attractions to view. Most of the rides wont suit children over 12 yrs. There is super cool air conditioning in all the buildings cause you really need it, its really hot and humid here.There is a mall across the road from Legoland which sells lots of souvenirs. Both Legoland and mall accept SGD, so dont feel you need to bring Malaysian ringgits.. the exchange at the time was 1 SGD to 3 ringgit and all the shops actually have the exchange rate out front. Dont worry if you forget any ammenties either, the shops on the mall all sell umbrellas, sunscreen, hats, ponchos and they are very cheap. There are 2 parts to legoland, the attraction itself plus the waterpark next door... we did not do the waterpark, but from talking to the people on our bus they thoroughly enjoyed ",4.0
2541,Not as great as I expected.,"If you are such a hardcore lego fan, you'd be disappointed. I mean, the store is also not really complete.. and some of the atractions are not really fun. It's so small, you can even reach there at 1 or 2 pm and at 5 pm you'll finish all the atractions.. at least that's what i experienced when i visited last august. ",3.0
2542,Fabulous for Kids and Adults Alike,The park is a lot of fun for all ages and the hotel is fabulous. It's themes are so well done. My Wife and I have been back without the kids for a nice meal and a fun night at the hotel. A mini date night.,5.0
2543,Waterpark is great for toddlers and adults!,"Pros:- the park is not too overly crowded (even on new years day!)- the lazy pool is pretty cool, there're lego bricks everywhere and you get to build a raft- there are many varieties of slides for adults and teenagers- there are many fun things to do for kids: building lego ships and lego tables - the duplo pool is perfect for toddlers, my boy loved it so much!- there is a baby room for nursing and diaper change- food was pretty good (or we are just very hungry)Cons: - weather was crazy when we went, rainy and windy, thankfully we rent the cabana- the floors in the toilet is very slippery so be extra careful when bringing kidsTips: - rent the cabana if you are a big group of people, it comes with drinks, safety deposit box, and free legoland towels- bring your own towels if you don't want to be charge for renting there- buy the tickets online on legoland website you can save up to 20-25%",4.0
2544,The best fun!,"We loved Legoland! It was such a fun adventure for our family. The kids loved all the rides and everything Lego. The shows were also fantastic. It would have been great to see a little more Lego merchandise - for example T-shirts (if there had have been lego t-shirts, we would have bought 1 each)!",5.0
2545,Not a very special one,I'm only interested in the landmarks of the asian countries built by Lego bricks. Other attractions are not special. I suggested to add more world cities landmarks (including the world landmarks) built with Lego bricks like Madurodam in Netherlands. An indoor attraction is highly suggested due to the extreme heat during dry season and heavy rains during rainy season.,3.0
2546,Great fun for kids,"We were lucky to visit Legoland on a rainy day. Heard that the place is usually uncomfortably hot. We thought that the heavy shower in the morning may have deterred some from participating. Thus, our queue -times were shorter than expected and we managed to experience all the key rides.Service at their restaurants needs improvements in terms of efficiency.",4.0
2547,Great family day for small children,"We booked with Viatour to do this day trip.  We left singapore about 8:30am arriving at Legoland at 11am, it took a little while to go through customs lines.  It wasnt busy at all, so line ups were not a problem.  This park is really aimed at the 5ish year old.  Unfortunately they have a height restriction of 110cm, my 4 year old was about 2cm too short and they wouldn't allow her to go on most of the rides, so her day wasn't as good as it could have been as the only rides she could go on were babyish.  My 7 year old was on the other end of the scale and felt the rides lacked excitement, and our 18 year old, unfortunately wasn't catered for (however accompanied younger children and enjoyed the day for what it was)  Im not saying the kids didn't go on things, they did and they had fun, but if you have a thrill seeking child, maybe Universal Studios would be better suited for you. All in all we had a lovely family day and really enjoyed looking at all the lego models, we were picked up at 5pm and we had seen the whole park by then and the time worked out perfectly, kids were ready to leave.  1/2 a day was a long time on a bus for our families outcome, especially when Singapore is an amazing place with so much to offer families.I think the venue should re-evaluate their height restrictions and the age they are aiming at.",5.0
2548,Fun and enjoying for the family - Lego Land Theme Park,"Lucky the weather is cloudy so it is not too hot.Toilet is clean so no problem at all.Food inside Lego Land is usual a bit pricey but acceptable.Eat the food outside legoland entrance if you want. BUT you cannot go out and go back in unless you buy the wet park pass as well.Most attractions are very good.Queuing time is okay, some take a bit longer and some fast.Overall our family is very happy.We went by private car cost $210 (regular 5 seater car). Pickup and drop off to your accommodation/place.It will take a while during the exit and entry at the immigration between Malaysia and Singapore.It took us 1.5hrs on Monday morning to go to Lego Land from Singapore leaving 8.30am..Went back took a bit longer probably 2-2.5hrs by private car (leaving 6pm so you better leave Lego Land around 5pm and eat dinner outside for 1 hr).A few restaurants to choose from.If you are planning to purchase LEGO toys, expect to pay full price.You will find hard to find Lego toys though but pay a full price.note: I only buy key rings. There are some items with 50% discount such as clothes/swim suit (NOT Lego toys).So from 10.15am to 5pm will cover all of them without any issue including browsing the shops.",4.0
2549,great theme park,"right next to legoland hotel, the park is awesome! loved the water park! one of the best so far! will definitely recommend!",5.0
2550,Lack sophistication,"We are very timid people and we went to Legoland after reading reviews that all the rides are too lame for thrill-seekers. So we thought it would suit us just nice. But disappointment came one after another and culminated in the hugely disappointing 4D shows. The seats were complete still. The only 4th dimension experience you'll get is the water sprinkling from.....fire sprinkler?  Then there was 'The World's first Ninjago show' , which was a glorified puppet shows with stage lighting effects. Maybe targeted at pre-schoolers. Starwars fans would be impressed by the Starwars Lego exhibits. Another reason I'm giving a 3 stars was for the waterpark which was passable as the lesser cousin of Singapore's Adventure Cove. We do regret getting our annual pass thinking that 1 day would not be enough to cover both parks. Anyway,  I'd still recommend Legoland Malaysia to those who have no other themepark experience, bearing in mind that it is not in the same league as Disneyland or Universal Studios in terms of varieties of rides and impressive shows.",3.0
2551,Kids had a great time,"Our family went on a quiet day (Monday) and had a good time. One day was enough time to see and most things and for us two days would be too long (although we did not do the waterpark (attached) so that could be another day. We had virtually no wait times on anything.If you were going for a couple of days go to the park In the mornings and the waterpark in the afternoons when it's hotter or raining.Some rides were a little tame and quite short but it is aimed at younger kids (2 - 12). There are two larger roller coasters which should satisfy some thrill speakers but it's not an extreme offering. I think unless you are or have real Lego fans in you group, kids over 12 may find this a bit too tame - especially if you have been somewhere like Disneyland.We enjoyed some of the Lego building activities very much especially Mindstorm Dr Heartbeat - more so than most rides.Food I thought was well priced especially for a theme park and there seemed a good range of choice plus family combos on offer. Expect to pay about 15 - 25 MR per meal pack.The park is clean, we'll run and staff are all cheerful and helpful. Some outdoor Lego exhibits are looking a bit tired though.",4.0
2552,"Very good for the kids, especially the samller ones","A $180 each way trip up from Santosa for the 10 in our party was well worth it - Legoland was great for everybody. There did not seem to be any crowds on Sunday 3rd January which was the first day back at school for the kids - yes a Sunday. No lines, no queues - a great time. There is a KFC and Burger King on the outside of the park, but you can no longer get pass outs to feed the kids. Suggest you arrive just before lunch and feed the kids before you enter park - prices were very cheap compared to Singapore and next time we will stay in Malaysia. Fly into Changi and relocate to Malaysia - seems far better value.Would have rated a 5 except for the pass out issue.",4.0
2553,For sub-teens only,"Over-priced!Adults and late-teens may find it a bit boring.The rides are mundane and not impressed with the lego displays.The souvenir shops only cater for young kids, we can't even buy an adult T-shirt.The food in the canteen was poor and expensive. Better choices outside the main entrance.An annoying fact is once you go out, you can't get back in. Most parks would give you a pass or a stamp on the hand.",2.0
2554,Ok-ish experience,"This would be my second visit to Legoland Malaysia. I first visited back in 2013 when the place was still relatively ""raw"" and the water park is still being constructed. Can see significant improvement with more rides catered for adults and teenagers now. As the dry and waterpark isn't too big, i would recommend for visitors to visit both in a day. I find the waterpark generally more enjoyable than the dry park as the dry park rides are generally catered to young children hence teenagers and adults may find it a tad boring. Likes:1. Dry park - Technip ride is fast and nice 2. The water park is really fun, especially the jokers pool3. The new Ninja go show is nice although I did not expect a puppet show. ",3.0
2555,Great family experience,Took our 4 year old grandson from Singapore and he loved it.  Loads to do for him. We were very lucky as it was quiet the day we visited and only queued for maximum of 10 minutes for rides etc.   Have been to Legoland in UK and this one is better and a lot cheaper.,5.0
2556,"Details, Details, Details!","Best location if you want to spend two days in Legoland Malaysia. Staff are ready to serve with a smile. Italian Restaurant inside the hotel is superb. However, free wifi is very slow. But all in all, my family and I love this hotel. ",5.0
2557,Will Go Again ,"My kids and I enjoyed the theme park. We were a letter to take the kids to all rides with acceptable queue time.  We adults enjoyed as well.  I don't think both the theme and water parks are doable in a single day.  For me,  I couldn't do the theme park in knew single day.  Only negative feedback would be the price.  Everything from food to gifts to toys are costly.... I took the one day trip through WTS travels from Singapore. Trip was comfortable. One feedback for WTS would be to avoid waiting for passengers delaying at the checkpoint. The bus waited an EXTRA 1 hour just for one FAMILY with no updates. (That family should leave a positive feedback for sure) ",4.0
2558,Book early to save more and be ready for the fun!,"Before we went, we we prepared for the hot weather as we have read all the review from past visitors. But, we were so lucky that the weather was kind. There was no sun the whole day; and although the sky was covered by dark clouds most of the time, it only started to rain at around 2pm - 3pm which was the time we went for our lunch and we were able to continue our activity after that. To save money, book early from the legoland website and you will be entitled to 20%-25% discount depending on the promotion offered. Go early morning for the rides when there are not so many people, and you can take photos at the miniland last. Expect to spend the whole day here at the themepark. If you are planning to go to wet park as well, do plan it on another day. Plenty of activities for the kids. Overall, we enjoyed our visit in Legoland.",5.0
2559,Better than expected ,"We got a 2 day for the price of 1 deal through the hotel that can be used for both the water park and the main park. We were in JB the day the local kids went back to school, so it really wasn't busy, barely had to queue for any of the rides. Probably could have easily done both parks in 1 day, it's pretty small. Some quite good roller coaster rides (Dragon) and Lego building activities for down time. ",5.0
2560,Amazing hotel,The park was fun but the highlight was the hotel.  The best for kids that I have ever seen.  Dinner in the themed restaurant was so much fun.  The staff were amazing.,5.0
2561,THE BEST TRIP YET!,"I cannot talk more highly of the staff at legoland, especially Adley in the restaurant!  We had the most amazing trip there, felt very safe and well looked after. We stayed 2 nights and got a 2 day theme park pass for both legoland and the waterpark.I had a sore face after the first day from smiling so much! The lego theme is right throughout the hotel, i promise you will not be disappointed! WE got the deluxe pirate room, with our daughter completing the puzzle to ger the key code for the safe where she unlocked her free lego! Every detail is thought of, right down to the colour in lego table cloths. Prices are reasonable, this includes the gift shop. they have some stuff i have never seen in other stores before, so remember to save big! ",5.0
2562,A good playpark,"We went on 23 Dec 2015. It was a great experience for my kids. They loved it so much with a lot of playground and do yourself lego experience. While waiting for your kids doing the lego, you could just sit in the room without being bored nor hot. Not much trees yet, therefore you should bring umbrella or wear hat. ",4.0
2563,Nice place to visit but very hot,"Went there on a sunny day and it is very hot. Scorching hot. Had to apply lots of sunscreen. Nice design lots of children, worth having a look at",3.0
2564,Excellent family trip,"Having just returned from Tokyo Disneyland, I personally prefer legoland Malaysia as there was less crowd and hence the queue was much shorter. Some didn't even have any queue and this is considering it is jan 2nd, a Saturday and a weekend! The Ninja live show was excellent and high quality showcasing the skills of the puppeteers. My daughter thoroughly enjoyed herself a lot at the park and it only took us from 9.30am-130pm to almost ride most of the rides, about 80%. The rides were very suitable for young kids as well. However, We gave the high adrenaline rides a miss as my child was only 5. Thus, a must visit for anyone considering Legoland! No regrets and I would visit again! ",5.0
2565,"First Family Visit, Likely to Return when Kid is older","It was fortunate for us that we visited on a bright and sunny day in between rainy days. Large unsheltered space, which can be very hot during the day, but it was to be expected. Kid was below 6 yo, so some attractions he could not play. Will visit again when he is older. Staying at the Legoland hotel was a good experience.",4.0
2566,Not too bad,"If you're looking for a place to spend some family time while letting your kids go wild, it's a good place to be. Admission fee a bit pricey though.They have rides for young children and more challenging ones for older ""children"". Water park sounds fun according to my friend but we didn't visit this time round.",3.0
2567,Awesome Park!,"We have been to Legoland California several times, so we were looking forward to this experience. While some of the rides were the same, the miniland area was completely Asia, which was neat. We bought a 2-day pass and that was perfect. The first day we did the park area from 9:30-2:00 and then the water park from 2:00-6:00 (discount price starting at 2:00 for the cabanas, which is well worth it!). The second day we did just the park. It started to rain around 4:00, but fortunately we were staying at the Legoland Hotel, so it was super convenient to just head back to our room. The food and shops were standard, but with a bit of an Asian flare to the food. We were still able to find pizza, pasta and other kid-friendly food at the park. There are also plenty of Legos for purchase! We were a bit nervous that the kids may have ""outgrown"" Legoland, but they all had a great time. We had boys and girls ranging in ages from 9-13. We would definitely go again if the opportunity arose.",5.0
2568,Holiday,The place is very fun. Full of attraction but mostly for young childrens. There r adult games also but not many.,4.0
2569,Good for families with young children ,"This would be a good getaway for families with younger children as most rides as catered to children. There is a minimum height for certain rides. Ticketing counter opens at 9AM. However tickets can also be purchased online. Do reach on types of discounts and passes available. Park gate opens at 930 AM however park rides opens at 10AM to non annual pass and non hotel guests. The park vicinity is rather clean. Some parts such as Miniland not maintained so well with brick colours fading and leaves all around. The number of floats in waterpark around the build-a-raft area is quite limited. Sufficient lockers and shower rooms are provided for waterpark. For those who wish to wear their slippers around water park, shoe racks are available around. ",3.0
2570,Typical yet great,A great year end trip with the kids. The park has facilities convenient for children. The attractions were also wide. The hotel was a little too costly though.,4.0
2571,Legoland and water park,We were lucky with the weather. slightly overcast and no rain. Legoland was really fun and educational for kids. Water park is fun with all the slides. a great day,4.0
2572,PIZZA MANIA,"In terms of satisfaction of services rendered by employees when I get there . pizza is delicious and quality food I have ever eaten in a theme park in Malaysia or Singapore . one of the staff were friendly and helpful .. his services to my son also very nice . I 'll be there again , with satisfaction and service that is given by -Fatiha , hakeem & firdaus-",4.0
2573,At least a one-time visit is a must!,"Yes the entrance ticket is quite pricey but the visit was well worth it during December with its Holiday Extravaganza and extended visiting hours. If you don't drive, you can still take the shuttle bus from JB Sentral for the price of RM4.50 per way and it will take around 30-45mins for the journey.The queue for the rides were okay, not too long and we enjoyed most of the rides even as an adult! Surprisingly the Project X ride is much more intense than The Dragon ride! The rest of the rides are quite okay too - this is not a theme park meant for crazy rides, etc but for spending enjoyable time with family and friends. During most of the rides you will need to store your loose bags/items at the shelves available at each ride or you can opt to rent the expensive lock storages.When it became unbearably hot, we watched the Ninjago Live Show and the Star Wars Miniland inside air-conditioned building. There were 4 on-going 4D shows though we only managed to watch 1: Spellbreaker - just not enough time to complete everything within a day's time! In fact many of the indoor activities are fun and educational too.Although many complained on the price of the food but I thought it was quite worth it for the portion served and quite tasty too. For example at the Market Restaurant, for a small eater, you can go for the kids' meal at RM18 that comes with a main meal like spaghetti, a bottle of Ribena drink and a dessert of your choice (pudding/ ice cream/ fruit). But yes to bringing your own bottle of water. If you intend to try out the Dino Island ride, please bring your own rain coat because although at dry park, you will get splash wet from head to toe! And also bring own umbrella for walking around the Miniland Garden - quite huge space with many interesting landmarks.Souvenirs are quite pricey but there are a variety of lego items/bricks to purchase from different theme stores. Even the toilets are cute!Overall good visit for a first timer to Legoland.",4.0
2574,Not just for Lego buffs,"We booked tickets about 8 days before our planned trip to Legoland via the website. Unfortunately, when we received the tickets via email, it was wrong. We emailed them back and called the hotline. We were assured that the problem would be sorted out that very day. 2 days passed and still no response. We called again. The same answer. It would be resolved on that day. No, it wasnt. It took another phone call and finally it was resolved on the 5th day. Yeay!!If you purchase tickets more than 7 days before your visit (but it has to be a fixed date for your visit) online, you get a 20% discount.We visited on christmas day. As expected there was a long, long queue for tickets. So, was very thankful that we bought ours online.The theme park was littered with lego sculptures: life-sized scuba diver, life-sized father christmas, huge head of albert einstein, putrajaya mosque, angkor wat, tanah lot temple etc etc. Even if you're not a lego fan, you would be impressed!For star wars fans, star wars miniland is a must. Outside, a life-sized lego darth vader, C3P0 and R2D2 'greet' you. The star wars exhibit starts with a screening of a 5 min animated star wars lego video, as an introduction. Then you go through 4 rooms; each displaying lego models of the different phases (films) of star wars. Very cool!In terms of rides, there were 2 'grown up' roller coasters. All the other rides were more for 8-12 year olds. The kids enjoyed the driving school and wave racing. One of the rides involved getting wet so do go prepared!If rides are not your child's thing, there were also indoor, more intellectual activities like mindstorm. There's also a 4D film theatre.In terms of food, there are restaurants and kiosks all over the park. But ofcourse food is pricey. A set of chicken nuggets+fries+ribena cost RM18. A set of chicken rice cost RM28. I would suggest eating at the kings grill in Kingdom. Our bags were not searched during entry so i am not sure whether we are actually allowed to bring our own food in.The park staff were everywhere and always ready to assist. They were very patient and friendly with the kids. Not easy when there were so many running around!It takes about 20mins to get to the park from central johor baharu. There was ample parking. Parking cost RM10 per day. Restrooms were ample and clean. There were also suraus for prayer around the park. If parents do not want to enter the park, they can always wander around the shops at medini mall, just opposite the park.All in all, it was a good day out with the family. The kids were thrilled. ",4.0
2575,Great visit,"This legoland is smaller than Legoland California. But with humid weather, I think the size is fit for Asia.... it is very hot. It's clean and well organized. The Ninjago movie is a blast as well as the 4D movie. The rides are mostly for younger kids. All of my kids really enjoy the visit. Taxi is easy, lots of restaurant in the entrance. ",4.0
2576,Good Adventure,"It was a good adventure with my kids. The locker is good, but you must have a plastic bag to cover your camera or phone when you take it to water theme park.",4.0
2577,go to the legoland waterpark too!,"spare 1-2 hours for the waterpark at the end of the day. The LEGOLAND park itself is great, especially Ninjago show",5.0
2578,"Great for kids, not so much for adults","My boys had an enjoyable experience over at Legoland. It is near Singapore, we took a tour from local travel agent. The overall experience was good, just that the lack of good food and sweating hot weather made the experience less of a perfect one. One of the must-go destinations for families. ",4.0
2579,Pretty much all rides close in rain,"Yep. If you're unlucky enough to visit when it rains (quite often in the area), almost everything closes up as far as the rides are concerned for ""safety reasons"". Means we didn't go on anything reasonable for the day. Kids totally disappointed about that and the rides were very short for the ones that were still available. Food was ok in pricing (compared to other theme parks), retail Lego is standard pricing compared too everywhere else in the world. Some specialty items but not as much as you'd think. Some improvements: The passes should be changed to 1.5 day pass given that the area is very barren and that most visitors from Singapore do not reach this place until around lunchtime or later (Singapore & Malaysian customs are very inefficient). Given the high probability of rain, this brings the total value of play down to nothing for a single day ticket. ",3.0
2580,Great Theme Park but So-so Water Park,"Theme Park: It's our 2nd time here after almost 3 years. We had a more enjoyable experience this time since  my kids are a few years older (8 yo and 6 yo). I suggest that families should come to Legoland when their kids are at least 4 of 5 yo and meet the height requirement of the rides. These info are available in the website anyway. This is to maximize your time there and get value for your money too. I feel bad for babies and toddlers brought by their parents there, enduring the heat of the sun, while being carried by their parent or riding/sleeping in their strollers.Kids liked the most:- Royal Joust- Dragon's Apprentice- Driving SchoolYou shouldn't miss this!!! : Ninjago showWater Park: Not impressive for me. If you've been to the water parks in Singapore like Wild Wild Wet, this is just like it. Wild Wild Wet in Sg even has a longer or bigger river! If ever we go back to Legoland, I'll skip the water park and swim in the hotel's pool instead.",4.0
2581,Good for younger kids,"As the rides are not so scary, they are more suitable for younger kids (7-11). There isn't a ride here that would make my kids cry like those roller coasters at Disneyland. Now that my kids are bigger (15,17), the rides here are too tame for them. Nevertheless, they enjoyed the trip out here. We did the whole park in 5 hours (selected rides only) and skipped the very tame stuff. We spent a fair bit of time shopping for Lego. The most amazing thing for us were not the rides but the Star Wars exhibits.There is a BB8 Lego!",3.0
2582,Awesome!,A must visit for anyone coming to Johor. Be prepared to spend at least one (1) day for each park. And make sure you time your visit during non rainy season. Most of the rides will be closed when it rains.Overall a great place to be for the young and young at heart!,5.0
2583,Always  trip we look forward to year end ,"This is our 5th trip,  my kids are always excited and we will always have a day of full of fun and laughter..  Great place to bring kids...  Highly recommended ",5.0
2584,Great for adults and kids,Legoland Nusajaya is located some distance away from the city centre so it is best to drive or take a chartered taxi or bus. The park is completely outdoor and split into the dry and wet park. Not possible to finish both in one day but possible to finish one in one day. However do be prepared to queue during school holidays for the rides which may be anything from 15mins to 45mins.Park is outdoor and rides will be suspended during inclement weather such as showers and thunderstorms. Rides are more suitable to children above 110cm but there are also selected activities for those younger than 3 years of age.Food is mostly Western and Asian and slightly pricy.Tickets are also above average in price but great fun for the whole family. Be prepared to be sunburnt.Highly recommended for all ages.,4.0
2585,Legoland Resort Malaysia,"You can not go past this fantastic hotel for a holiday your kids will talk about for years. From the moment you arrive, the theming of this resort is phenomenal. From the entrance, the hall way, the lift and the room, lego is your heaven. The kids absolutely loved the free for all lego play in the entrance and foyer offering 24 hr lego play with a large cubby house and pirate ship. The location is excellent, the food great and the treasure lego hunt for the kids in their room all adds to a wonderful family holiday!",5.0
2586,Awesome place,My kids really had a great time here. We did 1 whole day for the theme park and next day we did the water park. A great place for family with kids. We will definitely go again soon!!,5.0
2587,Day trip to Legoland,"I was there on the 27th December with my wife and son. It was a late Christmas present to my 5 yr old son. I can only say I am impressed with Legoland Malaysia. My son loved it and even my wife did too. Me? I am glad I was proven wrong about Malaysia theme parks. I generally think any theme park in Malaysia would be a rip off with lousy maintenance and generally lazy workers and bad food plus dirty toilets. However with Legoland Malaysia it's not the case. Everything was working fine, the staff was superb and friendly, and the rides were great fun . Also very very clean theme park in Legoland Malaysia and rated as cleanest toilets in the whole of Johor State. I am proud as a Malaysian that I have such a good theme park in my country. I don't know what the people who rate this place poorly are complaining about. For the price you pay you are getting a world class theme park. Ok so it's hot, we're in the tropics man...so what did you expect? Snow? A little bit of common sense and the readily available indoor attractions and eateries took care of the heat. Note: bring plenty of water dudes...and an umbrella for shade and you are good to go. Personally I am thankful it did not rain. Also food was good with good choices. I only have a down side for the car park payment machine, it was problematic as it kept rejecting our notes. It took us quite a few tries to get through. I manage to catch the Christmas show, but it was just so so....Would have been great if we could get a picture taken with the Lego Santa after the show. Oh well nothing is perfect. I did not get any Lego sets on this visit as they were a bit pricey and my boy doesn't know how to play with them yet, but I will definitely get some when he is 6 or 7 years old because I intend to come back again soon. Keep on impressing the world, Legoland Malaysia!!",4.0
2588,Great day out,We visited with out young children and there were some rides the whole family was able to go on. The whole park is strongly Lego based and it's amazing to see. You can also hire strollers to save tired little legs. I want to visit again one day as we didn't get through everything we wanted to. The food was a bit bland though and we waited a long time for it to arrive. Other than that we had an enjoyable day. If you want to visit Legoland Waterpark also I suggest you book and joined ticket as this will save you money. Buying them separately can be quite costly. ,4.0
2589,First in Malaysia,"Love all rides, but price is quiet expensive for typical family. Should offer more promotions on the ticket price especially for people with large family members.",5.0
2590,Good for younger children/kids under 12 years old,"We went to LEGOLAND Johor Bahru from JB Sentral Terminal using Causeway Link Bus number LM1, the cheapest way to go to Legoland, 2 Kids and 2 Adult only total 14 RM, the ride for about 45 minutes. The LEGOLAND open at 10.00 AM until 19.00 PM for public holiday. We got promotional ticket only 75 RM/person for entering the Theme Park (not Water Park -different price). There are 7 themes, the beginning, lego technic, lego kingdom, land of advanture, lego city, and two of my children favorites are Miniland and Imagination. In Miniland, we can see all of famous landmarks, building and scenes around ASIA built by a billion lego bricks, and in imagination, we can see the LEGOLAND from top of observation tower. In here we can also  build and race ourown LEGO cars. The themes was set for a younger children, so there no really thrilled playground use to play for adult. Good for family vacation",4.0

2593,Good theme park for young kids especially boys,I have two young kids of 3 and 5 at the moment.  They enjoy it much for both the water park and the theme park. The fireman is a must play event for family.  It is also good for taking photos and get around.  The food outside the park provides more choice.  The hotel is also very good for displaying so much legos.  It is ok for taking shuttle bus or private car to the park from Singapore.,5.0
2594,Overpriced themed park!,"In my opinion, this theme park is really overpriced. I know there is a lot of rides available for the kids, but they need to be older or at least more than 120 cm to be able to get onto all the rides. So, not recommended for children below 120 cm, honestly (and they charge for kids more than 3 years). There are additional charge for all the sidegames and of course for any meals you purchase and what is Legoland all about.... LEGO.... so this is a place for LEGO fans. And clearly, I'm not one of them.Important tips: LEGOLAND has 2 parking... we parked in Plaza Medini and please do not park there if you're going to stay beyond 7pm. This is seriously the WORST parking experience because the queue for paying at the machine so freaking long... and that is not what you want after a tiring walk in the heat and rain with your little ones. You might as well park outside which is free, :). and yes you don't need to wait 30 minutes just to get out of the parking lot.",2.0
2595,Hot Sunny Day in December,"There were altogether 5 adults, 4 teenagers and 4 children.  We booked the trip to Legoland via a Singapore Travel Agent.  The coach to Legoland was very smooth; there was not much traffic at Tuas Checkpoint.At Legoland, there was long queue to buy tickets. But since we already had our tickets, we were able to enter the park immediately.  It was a hot day when we visited and there isn't much air-condition place in Legoland for us to beat the heat.  There are more trees now (or the trees have grown taller), but it is still very hot.We had our lunch at King's Grill.  There is this combo meal of 2 adult set meal and 2 children set meal selling at MYR65.  A good deal I would say.The usual wait for rides was rather long, minimum of 30 minutes wait to 1 hour.",4.0
2596,Joy and Fun For The Kids,"Visited Legoland Malaysia on 26-Dec-2015.  In-order to avoid the jam from Singapore we make our way into Malaysia at 06:30 am.  The traffic towards Malaysia is smooth with such earl\y time to travel after crossing the custom the team headed towards Jalan Simbang for breakfast.  the food there is nice and cheap will suggest that if you want to go there if you want to head there for a nice meal.After which headed down to Legooland and reached there at 09:00 am, will suggest that if you drive park at the mall carpark instead of the park carpark.  By using Maybank cards will help you save  for the entry tickets.I will said that the theme is really cater to children and maybe young teens as the moment you step in the theme park, you will be capture by the lego that you grow up with.  The kids will like it and the adult will enjoy the lego display that the park have for you.I think is a nice place for young children to enjoy themselves to the max and parent to use up all their energy to see their child enjoying themselves will definitely worth the energy spend in the theme park.As for the cost, I will said is worth it compare to other theme.",4.0

A must visit theme park in Johor, with over 70 interactive rides, shows and attractions. A popular theme park for local and foreigner tourists.",4.0
2600,World-class Malaysian theme park with unpredictable weather,"During our recent trip to JB-SG in November, we took our 3-year-old son to Legoland as he had been pestering us to bring him there, for several months already!While traffic was really good from JB to Nusajaya (the school holidays would only start a week after our trip), the weather was something else altogether - it was hot earlier in the morning before the rain poured, only to stop completely when we arrived at Legoland (and that was only until lunchtime!). If this is not unpredictable weather, then I don't know how to call it!Legoland is a theme park with something for everyone, that's all I can say. My wife and son absolutely loved the Miniland, with the amazingly detailed replicas of notable Asian landmarks (Petronas Twins, Great Wall of China, Angkor Wat, Taj Mahal, Brunei Mosque, etc.) as well as some JB-SG sights like the Boat Quay, JB City, and Port of Tanjung Pelepas. There were also many cool rides for young kids to go for, including a mini ""driving school"", boat ride, and rotating sky tower.But what really got my own attention was the amazing Star Wars MINILAND - seeing those Lego replicas really relived my childhood love for George Lucas' creation and they were really detailed. We saw stuff like a small Death Star, Millennium Falcon, those cool AT-AT machines, and the usual X-Wing + TIE Fighters, although it's unfortunate that the HUGE replica Death Star is no longer in Legoland Malaysia but was moved to another theme park.And while we didn't have our meal in Legoland, there was definitely a myriad of F&B outlets for visitors to choose from, including a beautifully done-up main restaurant aptly called the Market Restaurant - which was actually our place to take shelter when the rain started yet again!",5.0
2601,Fun day,This was an amazing experience for our children. Visited early December so very little wait time for rides which is lucky as it was quite hot and standing in the sun was not pleasant. Enjoyed most of the rides and attractions. I was most frustrated by the fact that I had read before going that Singapore dollars are accepted however some outlets did not take credit card and did not accept Singapore dollars. Once in a lifetime activity for our children who will savour the memories forever. Oh and visiting in December was nice to see the additional lego built attractions such as santa and his reindeers and sleigh.,4.0
2602,Interactive Family Trip,"Great family trip with entertaining for kids of various ages. Features 3 large playgrounds & lego build stations for the little ones who are too small to go on the rides. There were some nice parent/child rides (boat, fire station, airplane). Queues were decent during the Xmas holidays. Great photo opp at the Miniland. The new Star Wars exhibit was awesome. ",4.0
2603,Season ticket,Visited there early December. Surprisingly there were not many people and so lunes for the ride was short. The workers there were very friendly and helpful. The bathrooms and cafe were clean. Suggestion: Take the season ticket. You can go in 30 minutes early. ,4.0
2604,Great but Hot,"This is one of the highlights of out malaysia tour in celebration of our wedding Anniversary. It was really fun specially for lego lovers.. Everything is just made of Lego. The rides were amazing and the foods are superb. Although a little bit pricey specially for the souvenirs but ofcourse it's a themepark, right? The only downside is that it's extremely hot. Although there are lots of trees the temperature is just crazy hot. I even got a fever at the end of the day because of the weather. But it was so fun!!! I'll definitely come back!",5.0

2607,Interesting park,Legoland is interesting but having been there a few times the rides start to get boring. The rides are not too heart-palpitating so families can enjoy it together.

2609,Great for kids. ,"Study the Legoland brochure first before you enter the theme park. Mostly each hotel has the brochure. Start you journey in the theme park from the right side which is from the Lego City. Come early since the theme park is open at 10am. Do not forget to watch Ninjago show, ride the Dragon rollercoaster, enter the Star Wars kingdom and many more. If you enter the park late, probably you cannot finish all place in one day.

2614,Disappointing,"We have the Legoland annual pass so we made frequent visits to this theme parks over the past year. However, this trip has been particularly disappointing for a couple of reasons. I am shocked that the selection of Lego sets available for sale at the shop is less than what I could find outside. This being Legoland should have more, instead of less. A personal encounter with one of the staff from the hotel is less than pleasant and I do not look forward to bringing my children here again.",3.0
2615,A fun day for everyone!!!,"This was our first visit to Legoland even though we stayed a few hours away from JB. My family had been to Disneyland Anaheim, Hong Kong Disneyland, Universal Studios Los Angeles and Universal Studios Japan. We have no intention to visit Legoland at first because of some negative reviews from friends when Legoland Malaysia was newly opened.    The reason that we finally visited Legoland was because of my son's craze over Ninjago. LEGO Ninjago and The Realm Of Shadows live show was being played in Legoland Malaysia.    We drove to Legoland from Kulai which was about 35-40mins away. As we used the highway, there wasn't any traffic jam and the journey was smooth.    To be honest, I was abit shocked to see the parking lot of Legoland. It was like an abandon piece of land. If there wasn't a welcome board with Lego man on it, I would definitely not park there.    We bought combo tickets, therefore we could use both Water and Theme Park. There were lockers outside the entrance and all over both parks but we decided to rent a large locker ( RM40 ) in the Water Park before we started our exploration.    Weather was hot but there were shades and benches everywhere for resting. As outside food was not allowed in the park, we had our lunch at Market Restaurant inside the Theme Park. The price was reasonable for International Theme Park standard. Paid RM120+ for 4 kids meal set and 2 adult meal set ( 1 main course, 1 drink and 1 dessert ). For those of you that would prefer something cheaper , you can actually go out to Medini Mall ( which was right in front of Legoland entrance and about 2-3 mins walk away ) and have some fast food ( KFC and Burger King ). Since we have combo tickets, we were allowed to walk in and out of the park. I wasn't sure about Theme Park ticket whether walking in and out of the park was allowed or not.    We didn't get to go to a lot of rides as there wasn't enough time to do so. Went to water park after lunch ( around 3pm ). We spent a few hours there and yet we couldn't finish trying out all the water slides. The slides were fantastic. One of the best that I have tried so far. But the only downside was the attire worn by some of the guests. It was stated very clearly in Legoland website that proper attire is to be worn but i saw some guests in T-shirt & track suit,  T-shirt & short pants and the worst was a lady in her Punjabi clothes. The lifeguards were at every slide but none of them say anything to these people. Sad to say but I can only find this swimming attire problem in Malaysia. I have been to so many countries but I have never seen guests going into the water in T-shirt or home wear.   There were cabanas for rental in the Water Park ...for those that need some privacy. But it was pricey.    Souvenir shops can be found everywhere. It is a must for Lego crazy fans to visit the shop. My children had such a good time in Legoland that they were discussing about their next visit and whether to get an Annual Pass or not...on the way back to the hotel.    Last but not least, do make sure that you are not leaving the park too late as the walk back to the parking lot was very long and quiet. We left Medini Mall around 9pm+ after we had our dinner. Our car was the last 3 cars parked in the quiet parking lot. Parking fee was RM10 for the whole day.",4.0
2616,A full day of activities,"If you have a the whole day (from 10am to 6pm) and ready to part with your cash for unreasonably priced everything, this is the place for you.If you have a combo ticket (Dry & Wet), depending on the weather, its best to start with the dry area first. If its not going to rain, expect hot, humid & sticky condition. If you have kids, most of the rides requires that your kid is above 1.2m height. The dry area is very big with a lot of activities and photo opportunities. The restroom are pretty clean.The food & drinks are unreasonably priced as expected in every theme park. Smoking area is rare and hard to find. The water park is great too especially if you have kids. A lot of slides of varying extremes you can ride with your kid (if they are tall enough). If you have younger toddler, there's also activities for them.The only downside & silliness is the parking. The only way to pay for your parking is at the hotel reception. But to get to the reception, you need to get the lift lobby. But access to the lift lobby is only possible if you have the hotel guest access card. It doesn't help that the place is like a maze. So trying to pay for your parking can be an adventure by itself to put it mildly.",4.0

It was Thursday and Friday during the school holidays here inMalaysia and neighbouring Singapore but the crowds were not too heavy and rides were a 5 to 15 minutes' wait away. Of the millions of Lego bricks used, the Star Wars exhibits were the best - which of course inspired frenzied buying of Star Wars Legos.

The benefits is that the kids can participate in the 2 hour long indoor , story and competitive driven lego bricks building using the more expensive mindstorms lego sets. Its the only building for indoor activities as well since when we went its a rainy day. The different between house lego and theme park lego its just that are massive amount of them to play with, admire the replicas with animatronics and proximity sensors. The Starwars area is a blast as well as the middle kingdom adventure. The rest  of the rides are standard theme park fares so let just the kids run around having the time of their life. Plenty of food outside and inside the park but staying at the Legoland hotel is recommended to maximize your quality time there ( The massive amount of lego bricks to play with 24/7 are at the reception area).

We could not believe that most rides you just walked straight up to with no waiting.  The longest we had to wait would have been 5 mins as we just missed the train.

The staff helpfully recommended that we enter the wet park first  (purchased combo ticket) due to weather conditions at that time of year. The wet park was enjoyable, if on the less spectacular side. Nonetheless, I found the slides fun and enjoyable. We were enjoying the wet playground, in particular the giant bucket spilling water when the skies opened up and the thunderstorm started. That took a good hour or more to subside. We used the interval to move to the dry park. My 8 year old daughter enjoyed the Ninja show the most, while my 12 year old son enjoyed the Star Wars ""museum"" the most. Of course we tried all the kids friendly rides.

2647,Kids enjoyed it,"Kids of 8,10,12 years old enjoyed it. Both water park and dry park.They liked the roller coaster - there are three of them (dry park) and the slides in waterpark. We were lucky that there was no rain for the whole day.Food and drinks price is expensive, but if you are hotel guest holding multiple entry pass, then you can go in and out as there are shops right opposite of legoland main entrance (within walking distance). As such we did not try out the food being offered within the park.",4.0
2648,Lego heaven!!!,"I will be a bit bias on this review as I really love lego since I was a child. This place is like a heaven for me. I visited this multiple times already and every time I leave, I have a huge bag full of unopened lego boxes.The place is so huge and can be very hot at times, so please wear comfy clothes and shoes. Water is very important to keep you hydrated all the time.",5.0
2649,Suitable for kid,It is very suitable for kids to play and learn. There have water park and theme park. If buy combo you may go in to the water park first because the theme park is more bigger than water park. The water park playground is very fun for teen but the information at there is no enough clearly. The toilet is very clean and many toilet at there. girl no need worry because the toilet no need to line up and wait for bath. The food at the theme park is very good and the staff services also very nice .,3.0
2650,A Whole Day Activity At Just One Park,"Don't buy those combined 2-park tickets, instead, just buy the single ticket, either the water park or the theme park. Reason: There won't be sufficient time in one day for you to do both parks properly. My family went to visit the theme park in November, and the park was not full. The waiting time for all the rides was below 9 minutes. Despite that, it took us the whole day to finish all the rides at the park. ",4.0
2651,Just took pictures ,"Before we come here, we seek to know about this place, this place is suitable for families with children. Therefore we dont buy a ticket, we just took pictures and bought souvenirs legoland, hehehe",4.0
2652,Great for those with young kids,"Legoland has a good mix of rides/activities for both young and older kids. Some parts not well maintained, but in general, we always have fun here. ",4.0
2653,Fun for the kids,"Lotsa Fun rides and interesting shows for the kids. But at least a quarter of the rides aren't for kids below 1m in height. Lego merchandise are plenty and parking is ample. Had to walk thru Medini Mall to get to the entrance of the theme park. The place gets really hot especially around noon. Enjoyed the 4D show, the Star Wars show and the rotating tower that offers spectacular view at the top. We bought the 2-day tickets and spent the entire second day in the Wet Theme Park. Not as hot comparing to out first day in the main (dry) park as the splashes of water is able to keep the fun being spoilt by the heat. ",4.0
2654,Great place to visit,"I thought of like I will never like going in here alone but to my surprised I just enjoyed being a solo traveler  and see the beauty of the place to offer.  I even took some rides and had fun.  Took many photos , almost all of it. The thing is, it was so sunny that day and sooo hot.  But then again, it's a great place to visit especially if you're with the family or friends.",4.0

2659,Great theme park needs improvement,"It's a great theme park for kids between 4-10 yrs old. I had my visit with great fun with kids from 10am till 7pm. You spend the entire day with joy here. Many Lego and great to see.However, there are many improvement required.1) more sun shade. There are plenty of non shade area especially moving between attraction. The queue area shade also rather short. Consider Malaysia is a sunny country, Lego land indeed need to redesign their park and improve shades in their park. It's the hottest park I ever visit2) food quality. Not bad but nothing to expect. Can't they offer some Lego style food? Burger and pizza is just so disappointed 3) transport. There are. Buses from Larkin bus terminal I heard. But however bus access to Lego land are too limited. I would expect there should be more shuttle bus from Lego land to Singapore custom at 7.30 pm4) locker. Due to safety requirement. All bags need to be stored at a box before ride, but the box is open to any one. At least offer some lock box for short time deposit of camera or valuables. Visitor please make sure you pack your belongings before go.Other than these improvements, it's great fun for kids. When kids enjoy, parents are more than happy.",3.0
2660,Hot but Nice Place,"Went there with my family somewhere in June 2015. 75% of the time was in the wet park this round. For your information, this is our 2nd trip here. The 1st was somewhere in 2013 but that time was a rainy day....This visit we spent most of our time in the wet area. Great fun but is really hot... Recommend you guys to drop by if got chance here. A day or 2 will be great.",3.0
2661,Great fun for families with young kids,We stayed at Legoland Hotel which is two minutes away from the park.Easy access to many rides both in water park and legoland.Food court outside the hotel is only five minutes away.,5.0
2662,Few tips from Annual Pass Holder,"Since I and my family holding Premium Annual Pass (luckily I am Johorean), Legoland is our playground where we spend our weekend & public holiday there. First what you need to know is Legoland split into theme & water park. My tips:1) Ticket for adult & kid a bit expensive but you can search for discount voucher such as Tesco promo, Cereals, Dutch Lady, or Groupon.  Or sometime they offer 50% discount if you come with your friend who have annual pass. Check out on Legoland website.2) Bring together a poncho (you can buy it at Rm2 ringgit store). Of course it help if raining but believed me you will need it at Pharaoh's Revenge. 3) Buy some snack/ drink outside.4) If you want to buy any merchandise, look for other people for who have annual pass (blue for premium). Become a thick face, ask to borrow their pass and you can get 10% discount at payment counter.5) Come during non public holiday or school holiday if you want to experience unlimited roller coaster ride (i have experienced  3X non stop).6) Height limit for kids is above 110cm. If you kid height is marginal, use 'spice girls' alike shoes.7) Locker rental at water park is expensive. It is advisable not to bring so much thing inside water park.8) Safety jacket is free to wear for adult and kids in different sizes. 9) Parking fee is RM10, again if have thick face you can borrow other people annual pass & claim free parking at customer service counter.10) I & my family like this park very much since located only 10km from my home. The easiest way to go here by car is using PLUS highway toward 2nd link bridge, exit Gelang Patah / Nusajaya. Heading to Nusajaya/ Medini. Legoland is about less than 5km from the exit. Enjoy!!!!",5.0
2663,"Fun, fun, fun","I have been wanting to bring my children here. Finally now my sons,  8 and almost 5y.o are at the right age to enjoy most of the rides. I bought the combo ticket through legoland hotel booking. So we had the privilege of early entrance and multiple entry. Foods were expensive so we went out to Merini Mall (which is right in front of the Legoland entrance) for lunch. Weather was hot but kids just having too much fun.",5.0
2664,Kids having great time,"1) We stayed in Legoland Hotel and in my opinion, there should be attractive price given for the entrance tickets. They do give 20% to myKad holder and 35% for Maybank credit card holders so please utilize this.2) The foods and drinks are expensive inside Legoland so those with budget please bring your own snacks and drinks just in case. 3) Comparing to Universal Studio Singapore (USS) Legoland was definitely smaller and one could finish all the attractions if they didn't spend much time at the same place so one day in the theme park itself is sufficient4) Some staffs were not really well-trained - rules were not explained when we tried the fire engine activity in Lego City. My wife exited the vehicle early before the end and was scolded by the staff which clearly didn't say anything before we started. In fact he was just afraid that his superior would reprimand him if he was seen. ",5.0
2665,Fun Place To Be!,I totally enjoyed my time there as the rides were fun and staff were friendly. There were lots of interesting things to see too. What's lacking is signages leading one park to another and food wasn't as interesting as what you can get in Disneyland or Universal Studio.,4.0

2667,Great place to bring the kids,Easily accessible via 2nd link by a bus (JPO2) that leaves at scheduled timings. Full day of fun under the sun suitable for younger children.,4.0
2668,Enjoyable Experience for Kids,I've been here twice. The first time when this park was newly opened with no trees and the surrounding areas still under construction. The second time was better as I stayed at Legoland Hotel and the theme park is a walking distance only. The theme park seems cooler than the last time with a lot of additional attractions for visitors. ,4.0
2669,Second visit. Ll come again. ,My last visit was on July 2014. And kids requested again on November holiday. Legoland is a very kids friendly park for younger toddler. My gals are 6 and 4. They enjoyed it very much. ,5.0
2670,Your kids happiness moment..,"be there during last Hari Raya with the whole family. My kid was very excited during the trip. A lot of fun. Good facilities Location a bit far and hot. but is value for your kid happiness. Don't forget to bring umbrella, water, spare shirt. Have Fun!  ",4.0
2671,perfect for young kids 100%,"with my son being a Lego addict at 4 years old and me of course a huge lego addict ! we had to visit this place. its the nearest one to us other than the one in Denmarka bus ride from Singapore for 1 hour and some customs and a bit of traffic. we get there with sunshine and clear skies. (take an umbrella not much shade is available)all the rides are perfect for young children around 5 years old is perfect so they are tall enough to get on all the rides !we are able to ride them all too maybe just 2 or 3 that are for kids onlythere are 3 water rides so you will get wet ! take extra shirt for the kidsthe food is not bad for a theme park, prices are good too. the rides were empty being a school day. the staff were very nice and kind to the kids. also let my son ride more than once in a row. our favorite was The Dragon roller coaster, its a nice sized one for this age and was a hit with my 5 year old. he had his first adrenaline rush LOL but that made his day and got him hyped for other rides.take money or a credit card because the Lego store there is just amazing LOL you can tell im a Lego addict we spect much time in the stores so make that plan!All in all we will visit again because this was the first theme park that a 5 yearold CAN ride all the rides !!!great time and great memories !",5.0
2672,Legoland Lego Display :D,"Legoland is a place I would've enjoyed more if I were much younger - I am honestly more of the thrill-seeking type and the rides were designed for a much younger group. For me, the highlight would be the Lego miniature world display as everything looked so detailed and perfect!",3.0
2673,Lots of activities to do with kids,"easy parking access and also great baby care room. so convenience for mother with babies. a lot of activities and the water park was awesome. however, very limited activities for toddlers and the food & tickets was quite expensive.",4.0
2674,A Family Oriented Themepark,"Been an annual member since it opened its door. Can definitely see the improvement year after year. The rides were properly maintained too. And usually the queue for the rides will not be long, unless you are there during school holidays or public holidays.Bring along an umbrella, although there are more trees now, it's still very hot!",4.0
2675,Disappointing!,"It didn't help that it was oppressively hot but for a weekend day with very few people it all felt a bit sad! Compared to other theme parks in Singapore, Australia and even Waterbom in Bali it seems to be worn, faded and to lack something. There is some effort to have air-conditioned cool-down spaces but when outside even the shade was hot. Its very much plastic and concrete, nothing lush and tropical about it. Took the bus from the flyer in Singapore which was a very efficient way to do a day trip. I didn't see inside the Legoland Hotel but was glad we hadn't stayed out there..its literally in the middle of nowhere apart from the park. Travelled with 3 kids, 8 12 and 14. Was probably a bit young for them though be aware of height restrictions for the rides for little ones. Was ok and young lego crazy kids would probably love it for the day..",3.0
2676,"Fun, fun, fun! :D","It was great! Of course people were staring at us - 2 adult people acting like children, but I realy don't care.You pay only for the entrance ticket - all of the attractions are included in the price. Water slide and big castle were the best in my opinion. There is this LEGO Star Wars pavilon with all the Star Wars history described with LEGO exhibitions. There are also a lot of buildings made from LEGO.There are some places to eat and stores with souvenirs. We spend like 5 h there. Totally worth it :D",5.0
2677,Amazing display of world scenes,"Getting there from Singapore through Border Control is time consuming we took a private car but you can catch the bus from the Flyer. Once there prepare to be amazed. Displays of full sized animals such as Camel an Giraffe, sight disposals of Taj Mahal, Thailand Temple, Forbidden City & Great Wall, Changi Airport, Singapore River City, Docks complete with Cruise Ship, Anka Wat, Malaysian Temple and many more. Then the Star Wars exhibition which had scenes from all of the movies with Death Walkers , the Mellinium Falcon. All displays had working motels with lights & sounds. Then there was all of the rides such as Cars. Boats, fast rides, slow rides, train rides and many more. Something for all ages.",5.0
2678,Lego Land,This is also only a few years old . So the condition is good . It is near tuas . That means near singapore . It is some what like universal studio in singapore . But as it is in malaysia it is quite cheaper than singapore . A must for kids ,5.0
2679,Fun!,Enjoyed the rides though not extremes cause I presume it's really intended for kids or young ones. Try the Dragon Castle ride. The water park made it more fun. Enjoyed the thrilling rides. Unique slides. Though you may stop in the middle but it was a thrill. ,4.0
2680,Full of fun!,"i went there last year and was very happy with the visit eventhough i could not play few attractions due to my age..hehe. if you are planning to go both water and theme park, it is very advisable to go in seperate days (2-days pass) or else you will be very tired to finish all rides in there. Wear cap because there is only few trees in there.",4.0
2681,Best place ever!,"We went there twice and tomorrow we may even go back again, anyways we have the annual pass that allows us to enter Legoland as much as we like for a year. Also we managed to collect good mini figures and enjoy the rides too. Had a great experience at Legoland!",5.0
2682,Good service goes a long way..,Was there with my kids for a short staycation. I was amazed by the warmth of the staffs in the Legoland hotel. They are all very friendly and sincere in rendering help. Will surely be there again with my kids. Kuddos Legoland Malaysia..,5.0
2683,errr .... is that it?,"We came here full of expectation, only to find out that it is somehow over-rated for what it has to offer.Pros:- The well stocked shops with Lego packs of different sizes and budgets.  Most of these are not so easily available in chain stores.- The Ninja show - a good escape from the afternoon heat but basically it is a puppet show with a small amount of special effects.- No queuesCons:Apart from a few roller coasters, the park reminded me of an aging 3-star theme park.  The playgrounds are similar to those found in a good outdoor park in other parts of the world.  - The games and rides are old-fashioned and dated (akin to those at Blackpool in the UK)- F&B outlets have very limited choices and are full of patrons escaping from the elements outside (understandably so as there aren't enough shades or trees in the park)When put alongside the Water Park next door, it seems the designer has a more wholistic view of the patrons' expectations.",3.0
2684,Kids like it,"I visit with my son and my nephew, they are really excited to visit this place finally able to visit this place, they are very happy because this time they could only imagine when they watch legoland movies.",4.0
2685,Good family fun,"Legoland is big enough for a day of good family fun with many rides, shows and activities even you are like me - not a lego fan. The place is hot but I can see the park put in great effort to ensure the comfort of visitors while waiting for the ride. Covered shelter, fan even strong blower can be seen while queuing up for ride. The air-condition theater provide temporary relieve from the hot weather while enjoying the performance or movie. Not too crowded so if you are interested in particular ride you can try it again and again. The cafeterias inside the park provide a wide variety of choice for food and it is good too. Take note if you are going during year end, when it rain, all out door activities stop!  ",4.0
2686,Lego Land Review,"First of , I was really impressed with the statues of Lego land because literally everything is made from Lego - Even the ice cream Mascots üòÇ A for effort!! - The only down side I see in Lego land is that It's too ""baby"" - This theme park suits kids who are around maybe 15 and below? - From the rides to the shows I found it ""cute"" but not entertaining (talking in a perspective of a 20+ yr old) - Even their live shows and 4D - I love how much effort they put on it but the show itself is for kids that my parents fell asleep ~ I hope they would create a Lego Land for teens and that They would also give ""Emmett"" from the Lego movie an attraction üòÇ - Their main attractions are the ninjago and the other lego animations shown in CN Second : For me lego Land is still a must see attraction - and if you ever do go do participate in the Robot logo activity where in they would show you how they program lego robots and how you can do it too :) its fun/educational :) ",3.0
2687,I liked it better than Disneyland,It was the most chill theme park that we have been to. We didn‚Äôt feel overwhelmed or rushed. The park is designed for a good day or two even with a slow pace. I would suggest to spend two days if you want to visit the water park as well. Legoland Water Park is the most fun water park that we have visited.,5.0
2688,Definitely Going Back There Again,"Must visit place in Johor especially for Lego lovers..I went there for a day trip from SG with my family..Since I brought along 1 toddler and 1 senior, I can't get around quickly so I haven't had the opportunity to try all the rides there..Hope in my next visit I can also try the Lego Waterpark & Lego Hotel.. :)",5.0
2689,Fun filled Day Trip from Singapore,Perfectly doable as a day trip from Singapore. We went with our 3 little ones and they all had a ball. We went via the Tuas crossing and as advised we found the border crossing smooth and swift. We bought the Premium Annual Pass as it was on offer and works out to pay itself in the 3rd trip. Great selection of rides and plenty to keep all ages under 12 occupied. We were planning to do both water park and amusement park in one day but despite the rain only managed to cover the amusement park and that too not fully. Some great options of food spread across the park. The staff is helpful and wearing almost permanent smiles! Our plan next is to stay the weekend in the Legoland hotel but it was full this time. Highly recommended for any family with young kids.,4.0
2690,Amazing and kids enjoyed it.,"My family had a wonderful time at Legoland. The amusement park and the water park was next to each other and the family enjoyed their time at both parks. We stayed at the Legoland hotel and it was excellent. We had fun in trying to unlock the cabinet where there was some lego gifts inside. We also spent time at the lobby in the evening, where the kids played lego bricks. As for food, there is a mini shopping area where there were some restaurants and fast food outlets, so we didnt have to venture out to town for dinner. Overall, an excellent trip and it was worth the money spent. ",5.0
2691,Fun for the family,"A must visit for kids. Do note that children must be of a minimum height to enjoy all the rides. It is an all weather park, so it's a must to bring along an umbrella/ ponchos and caps/ sunblock.  ",5.0

The buffet area, the toy areas, the park, lego pools and the room is Lego heaven for kids.     ",3.0
2694,went for day trip from Singapore,"Ee visited logoland for one day from Singapore. We found a driver to pick us up early and drive us to the park. We did the waterpark first, then the amusementpark.  We went on a week day and didn't have a line for any of the attractions. Lockers are available for rent which made it easy to do both parks. The driver picked us up and took us to eat crab before taking us back to Singapore. Easy fun day.",5.0
2695,Amazing day !!!,"It's beautiful place to go.We enjoyed every moment there.The ride suitable for everyone. We love the dragon and dino island. Great food especially their grill chicken burger until finger liking good. Yummy pizza.. We eat until full.. The price reasonable.Fun activities at Burger Junction my children love it. My son keep saying its amazing.. I believe they really enjoyed every moment.. Great service from the worker there. Thank you to endang and umi for the kind and friendly service. We won't forget that.Before leaving, make sure you grab something from Big Shop..Our hearts leave at Legoland.. We will come back again..very soon...",5.0
2696,Fantasy Land for Lego Lovers,"Loved every moment of our time here. This is a Theme park + Water park but requires separate tickets for entry. Ticket deals were better as we had gotten combo tickets with our hotel stay, that gives you multiple entry options as well. Going for two days is better if planning to visit both the water & theme park. Though the water park wasn't very big, it was absolute fun. It has those big water slides as well. The theme park is segregated into different themes. So each theme has its rides, goodies shops & restaurants. We went on weekdays so it wasn't crowded, that made it a lot more relaxing & no waiting in queue. Luckily the weather was also better but it does tend to get hot. So carry sunscreen, shades, hats or even umbrellas. They have placed a few fog misting system units for cooling at the park. The Star Wars exhibition & the miniatures cities are work of art. About Lego stores, Pros: Large varieties. Cons: They aren't cheaper than what you get outside. They have meet and greet with Lego figures walking around the park & pose for photographs as well, which was very exciting for the kids.",4.0
2697,Fun day out,"We were 2 adults, no kids taking a tour bus from Singapore with Discovery Tours that we booked on line.  Fantastic place to visit even without children.  Lots of rides and fantastic Lego displays, unbelievable what they can create with Lego.  We went on a Wednesday and it was awesome as it wasn't busy at all, no cueing.  It can be very busy weekends and school holidays and cueing would not be much fun as it was hot, no grass anywhere.  Make sure you have Malaysian Ringgits if you are coming from Singapore.  They will change money but better to get it before you go for a better exchange rate.",4.0

2701,Amazing Legoland!,"Legoland Malaysia is a magical place. It was great and wonderful! For me, one day was not enough, because did not have time to go to the water park.Despite the fact that we're a couple of 30 year olds it was there I had a 5 year old :)I would highly recommend!",5.0
2702,Lego Creation,"Legoland is great place for kids recreation and also for adults, The miniature of some different places and landmarks made of lego are nice like the real building in a picture. I also enjoy the waterpark.",4.0
2703,World Class theme park,"We visited from Singapore using the excellent services ""MyTripTransport"". We got to Legoland about 10 minutes before opening and were picked up at 5pm. We wish we had booked the car later, in fact we wished we had stayed overnight and visited the water park the following day. This was an excellent world class attraction. Our grandkids were 8 and 10 and had a great time. We visited on a Sunday and there were no queues at all. The kids could get off a ride and then straight back on if they wanted. The lego stage show blew us away. Everything about this park was so professional.Food was fine, ammenities were clean.We purchased our tickets on-line and saved a little over the gate prices. The trip from Singapore only took about 45 minutes.",5.0
2704,Fantastic for LEGO lovers,"We spent four days at this resort in January 2015 and enjoyed every moment and we were NEVER bored even for a minute.  This is primarily a place for children up to the age of 12.  My son is 11 and he had an amazing time and wants to go again next year.  We spent two full days at the LEGOLAND theme park, one full day at the LEGOLAND water park, and on the final day we divided our time equally at both parks.  It was in fact cheaper to just buy an annual pass so we did this.  The mini land display is so extensive it is not the sort of thing you just glance at and walk away from.  We spent at least 2 hours just viewing the incredible details of the display each day that we were there.  So the negative people who say there's not much to do or who claim you can complete the whole park in one morning are clearly not LEGO lovers or don't know how to have fun with their kids.  I went on all the rides with my son and I loved them all.  You have to get down and have fun with your kids.  My son had no problem riding on the same rides again and again. There were no crowds and we did not have to wait long for any of the rides. There were some rides and play areas more suitable for younger kids and other areas more suited for older ones so everyone is catered for.  It's not just about the rides and LEGO displays.  We had fun browsing through the LEGO shops and my son also signed up for the various workshops such as robotics workshops which were free.  It was great that there were also tables where you can sit and build LEGO at your leisure. We also enjoyed the 'build your own LEGO character' tables.  I think the whole set up is wonderful. We stayed at the LEGOLAND hotel and thought it was a fantastic holiday overall.  Make sure you take a parasol/umbrella to shield yourself from the sun or rain and try the food court outside the entrance for some reasonable meals.",5.0
2705,Great place for kids,"I have visited this place early July 2015, with all families. This place is really good not only for kids but also for adult. I purchased the ticket through online so I got 15% discount",4.0
2706,Lego,"We booked a day trip from Singapore with WTS travel. The trip there was smooth sailing and we breezed through the immigration checkpoints, the return trip (4.15pm bus) we hit peak hour traffic and it was very tedious going through immigration, I think it took us an extra hour to get back to our hotel. Legoland had some crazy lego displays, the Star Wars display was a welcome relief from the oppressive heat, it's crazy humid and I was sweating in places I didn't think I would sweat! We didn't sample the rides as we were there purely for the displays. The lunch deal in the cafe was fantastic and good value for money.",4.0
2707,The only ones there!!!,"We stayed at the LLM Hotel and went for 2 days to LL.as we were there during the week, it was empty (good tip if you don't like crowds!) we had free rein of the park, we completed all rides multiple times. the park was very clean, as the workers had little else to do. some things need repairing, as with the hotel things are a bit weathered, they are building some new attractions in ""its a small world"" mainly Asian attractions (Petronas Towers) etc, should be quite special once opened.the food was very limited in the park, and a bit ""old"" probably made at the start of the day and then constantly reheated... but OK to eat if you're hungry, the water park was open and a refreshing break from the heat, they have a wave pool etc.",4.0
2708,Legos everywhere,"Legoland is great but pricey concept which works around the world. Children really love this but somehow I miss something with little more effort to entertain adults too - as they are forced to come here with their children and pay for it a lot too.There are little seeds of that too: In fire rescue you can take your parents to your team and the train is also for the whole family - but as it's Legoland which has emphasis on creativity and innovations the whole theme park could also be little more innovative too.As being here twice there is one thing I really have to say: Legoland is hot. I mean hothothot. I talk about temperature and I guess it has something to do with micro climate but whatever the reason, remember, most likely the day is going to be hot.The restaurants in Legoland are ok, but I would like to see more variety in this too. There are little more variety on the road to Legoland but not as much as there could be as many of the shopping areas' houses are empty. I wouldn't stay at Lego hotel very long for that reason: There really isn't anything else at the neighborhood - just Legoland. But if you go to Legoland for two days (one for the water park and other for theme park) the Lego hotel might be good choice",4.0
2709,Legoland Adventure,"Our adventure started with a heavy pouring of rain for few minutes. We had to buy some raincoats before we finally enjoy the entire stay. We began with a roller coaster rides. Staff were accommodating,  courteous, and we'll discipline. Since it was raining, there were less queuing in some of the outdoor rides,  which made us repeat the thrills and fun. I would say my son really had a great day in this theme park. Even my parents in law were satisfied with their stay. Usually they watched us but today, they ridden and enjoy with us even it was bit  raining. What pleased me was a the food. We tried Western food and we were surprised of their big and delicious serving. Legoland design has a touch of various Asian cultures. Accessibility to Legoland from our hotel was very convenient, I would say 10 minutes ride. This place has reasonable value for money and really a excellent place for young children and adults, too. I advise to check the weather forecast before going to this place to make it worthy. We started and ended our journey with heavy downpour of rains. Good thing was, rainshower occurred when the park was about to close. Definitely, I will recommend this park. I enjoyed this park over Hongkong  Disneyland in terms of rides, food, things to buy,  value for money,  and overall stay.",4.0
2710,Just didn't feel like leaving the place,"Well Legoland is certainly a kiddie paradise. But adults too can have fun & let loose their inner child. The rooms are lovely & true to theme. We had a pirate themed room that also had an interesting treasure hunt which the kid totally enjoyed. The hotel has great food places. Lots of play areas with Lego blocks lying around. They also plan a lot of activities so kids are constantly engaged. The theme park is quite well spaced & a 2 day visit will ensure you have sufficient time for all the rides & entertainment areas. The shopping however is a let down. Coz unlike Disneyland, here the shopping is kid centric & ODs on Lego blocks. So not much for adults. All in all, a super break.  ",5.0
2711,A must for Lego fans,"Younger Lego fans (and maybe older ones as well) will love to explore this theme park. It is well laid out & maintained. There are rides & areas catering for young children through to early teens, with several theme areas/exhibits, areas for younger children to play with Lego and at least 2 medium sized roller coasters. We walked through Star Wars mini land which was very impressive with different scenes from the Star Wars movies recreated with fantastic attention to detail.Miniature Land is equally impressive with amazing, very large, scale models of asian points of interest such as the KL Twin Towers, part of Singapore etc. Food & drink purchased outside the park is not permitted. There are food outlets located throughout the park, ranging from small snack/drink vendors to the larger food outlet typical of Asian theme parks. We decided to catch the LEGOLAND Express to take a look around the park. A really annoying, repetitive audio loop about a ""12 second"" delay is played in the station where patrons queue to catch the train. If we had to queue for much longer than we did, I would have left as I wouldn't have been able to tolerate the audio any longer - I don't know how park employees tolerate this for a full shift!The Lego sets in the ""Big Shop"" are not any cheaper than we could purchase them for in Australia so it was not worth us purchasing Lego at the park.We didn't explore the entire park, avoiding areas for the youngest children. As such, we were at the park for approximately 5 hours. I would recommend allocating a half to full day to explore the park.",4.0
2712,Great place!!,"Fantastic. However, I made a mistake staying at the legoland hotel. It was in the middle of no where except to Legoland. I was bored the whole night. I suggest staying in city hotel like KSL Resort or Gordon hotel which are just 20mins shuttle to Legoland. ",5.0
2713,Legoland leg,"We spent a day at Legoland, our first time to set foot in Malaysia too. We arrived about 1hr & 30mins from our starting point of the Singa flyer via a WTS bus. It was stifling hot when we got out of the bus. The rides were good, especially the transformers roller-coaster. the staff were also very accomodating. The highlight of that adventure was seeing with my kids the awesome installations of different Asian landmarks around their park. Wowwwwww =)! Good thing too that there wasn't much qeueing. The ride going back though was long & tiring. We left Legoland around 5:30pm & got back to Singa at past 9pm already due to the very long line @ the border crossing.",3.0
2714,Great day out,"market style stalls and some shops prior to the Legoland entry, Fun and interesting and not pushy sales people. Brought tickets before leaving home for a discount. Adults, kids and seniors tickets available. Did not go to the waterpark. Park was clean, spacious and good fun for our kids age 9 and 12, Our 18 year old came along for the ride but found great photographing opportunities so he had a better day than we had expected. Star Wars Lego display was inside, air conditioned and very cool. I thoroughly enjoyed it. The lego train was great except for the repeatative voice over when at the station that says that the 'train is running 12 seconds late' in a dreadful englishmans voice.",5.0
2715,Place for kids,There's a lot of games for kids. Your kids gonna love being there. A bit like USS Singapore but for child. Adult can play too but its limited. Better to come when holiday. Its gonna be full but at least all the games will be opened,3.0
2716,"Great place for the kids, but I enjoyed it too","This place is everything Lego.  Even the soap is shaped in a lego brick!  We were on the last leg of our family trip and stayed a night in Legoland resort so the kids could have some fun.I must say I was awestruck by the place.  The wall behind the reception counter was made up entirely of tiny lego figurines.  They had a play area at the reception for kids to play whilst parents check in or out.  There was even a castle with a princess, an elf and a lego person walking around taking pictures with the kids.The rooms were themed and each suite had effectively two rooms, one for the parents and a bunk bed that could sleep up to 3 kids.  The kids sleeping area was separated from the master bedroom by a sliding door for privacy (and peace)!  There were 2 TVs - one for the parents and one for the kids, so there was no need to fight over what to watch.  There were lots of nice little touches in the room such as the treasure chest which the kids had to solve in order to get to the treasure of free lego figurines, a pin badge and a key chain.  There were two wash basins in the toilet - one for the adults and a lower one for the kids.  There were also kids bathrobes and slippers.  It is obviously designed with the kids in mind.Legoland theme park was pretty fun.  For me, the highlight was the live performance  in the auditorium.  It featured several lego ninjas on a quest.  My 2 year old enjoyed the rides on the boat and train.Breakfast at the hotel's Bricks family restaurant was good.  There was a wide range of cooked foods  to cater to both adults and kids.",5.0
2717,Not coming back again ,"Abit run down and boring. There was nothing much to do. Could do with a half day trip, because by 4 hours, you're done with the entire theme park and pretty much bored and exhausted(heat) by then.  ",2.0
2718,Go only if you have little kids in tow,"My 6-year old son is a Lego fan so naturally the place was enjoyable to him. He learned to face his fear of heights when I got him to ride 2 roller coasters and of course he was rewarded with a box of Lego City which was priced cheaper than when you buy from the mall. He also enjoyed the indoor activity where he got to build his own Lego racing car and compete with other kids. Not much excitement for bigger kids and adults. For me, my son's happiness is my happiness too.",4.0
2719,Family fun day,"We loved legoland, my niece really enjoyed all of the rides and we were amazed by the Lego! So lifelike and really interesting to see.

Our kids loved the place and wanted to stay longer.The staff were fantastic.",5.0
2721,Rating as adult (Excluding water Park),"If you don't have kids this theme park would be a little out of place for you unless you enjoy Malaysia in mini Lego.

2722,"Enjoyable Place, Can Improve More.","The place consists of a hotel, waterpark, and a themepark. We only went to the themepark; and even though we were adults, we enjoyed our time there. Most rides and shows are for kids. My favorite parts were Project X ride, then the Aztec-y river ride where water splashed all over us (a big relief from the humid air), and the replicas of different tourist spots in South East Asian countries. You will really appreciate and not help imagine how long and how hard those Lego replicas were made.Make sure to bring an umbrella (sun / rain), and definitely extra money - there are a lot of Lego sets that i think are only sold inside Legoland.",4.0

2726,AMAZING! ,We went here with our 2 children aged 6 and 11 years.Absolutely awesome for any lego enthusiast!We stayed in the Pirate themed room and had a duo pass for 2 days to the Waterpark and Theme Park.We definitely needed the 2 days as we spent an entire day from 11am onwards at both. The kids never wanted to leave.It says no outside food and drinks but we brought in all our drinks and it didn't seem to be a problem.Kids meals for RM18 included 6 nuggets and chips with a 200ml Ribena. We had 4 of these and there was food left over as the serving size was generous even for an adult. The hotel is amazing and totally caters for kids. Breakfast was organise chaos but the food is brilliant for all ages and services is prompt.Interesting things to see and do all over the hotel. Not a moments boredom! Brilliant 2 days had by all of us.,5.0

2729,Enjoyable theme park for all,"Had a great time with my wife & 4-year old son. Went to both parks. The wet park was superb, lots of wet fun especially for the kids. Beware getting sunburned, even the morning sun can be quite nasty. The main theme park was also great. Management did a god job keeping the place clean. Surprised that it was not very packed with people, considering it was a Saturday (maybe it's not the school holiday season). Getting into rides were pretty quick, max. 5 mins waiting time. Price for food is on the high side (similar to airport prices), but considering it is a theme park, it's normal.In short, highly recommended for the whole family. No regrets!",4.0

Park at Medini Mall for only RM2 as opposed to the RM10 at the legoland car park. The mall is linked to Legoland anyway and you have restaurants there too. What I was most impressed with was the staff. All were very well trained and extremely friendly. Great job to the management. 5 stars. ,5.0
2735,Good for Family and Group of Friends for a fun outing!,"It was an outing with my girlfriend and we had loads of fun!Though there were some rides which did not operate fully like the water raiders; the water cannons did not function, it was still fun with activities and shows! Ninjago is real good!A word of caution; save the water splash ride for the last as you will get 80 to 100% wet! LOL! It is really fun and will make you laugh!",4.0

2737,Amazing park for Kids and Adults! Total Fun!,"We went to Logoland in Oct end - Nov start. It was not at all crowded. The theme park is very well made and definitely a paradise for Lego lovers. Plenty of rides for adults and kids. Most of rides are for 100 Centimeter above kids in height. Though it also has play area for toddler and smaller kids like Duplo train ride, play park...animals, cars...everything of lego. Plenty of huge Lego animals is fun to watch and click. Enjoyed boating. Loved Land of Kingdom and Land of Adventure.  Enjoyed making Lego cars and racing with kid in their Lego studio (dont recollect exact name). Also had Halloween theme deco when we went.You will get lost in the artistry and level of detail in The mini city. Miniature of various monuments like KL Tower, KL Airport, Taj Mahal, SG Flyer, River cruise...can go on!It has number of Lego shops and you dont get all of it outside so can buy unique stuff.Overall very clean, well thought, enjoyable for all ages, food (Pizza for veggies like us).Water Park is also good though the expectation gets set higher after Theme park. Found it a bit small with limited options. Loved making Lego boats and riding it in water with my kid.We took 2 day pass as travelled with small kid. It is better as you can relax and enjoy but people who want to club everything (Theme park and Water park) in one day can do it if they have energy and want to rush through. Water part takes 2 hrs only if not crowded.",5.0

2743,Good attractions with disappointed shoppers,"Attractions - Very good:The park comprises LEGO Technic, Star Wars, Castle, Adventure, Duplo and City zones as well as a Lego miniature city. All attractions are suitable for kids and they seem to like them very much. More attention should be paid to workshops like the LEGO Mindstorms and Build & Test which unleash your kids' creativity and strengthen their knowledge on physics. If you have a 2-day combo ticket for this Park, make sure you let your kids build their own creations and compete with other children for the fastest LEGO car, and watch some 4D movies at the LEGO studio (one movie every 30 minutes).  The Miniland made of LEGO bricks is just awesome, with some controllable mechnical movements. Do clear the memory of your camera to take more pictures.Shops - Average:Not much surprise for LEGO fans. Expect normal LEGO sets, key chains and accessories in the shops. The Brick shop provides ""DIY-3-minifigures"" at RM33 but there are not many choices of headgear/head/body/legs/accessories for you to assemble a minifigure that makes sense. Recommended attractions:Project X, Star Wars, Observation Tower, LEGO Studio, Lost Kingdom, Dino Island (Caution: You'll get wet), Rescue Academy, LEGOLAND Express, Boating School and MinilandPoints to note:- 2-day combo is recommended for full enjoyment of the Park.- Singapore dollars are accepted by shops and restaurants but not by game stalls and penny machines.- If you are really interested in the DIY minifigures, go to the Brick Shop in the early morning.- The hand-crank penny machines because they always reject your banknotes. Be patient. Try RM1 if they do not accept your RM5 paper.- Exchange your minifigures with the crew members. They sometimes have valuable minifigures in their hands.",4.0

2763,Loved the water park,"My 12yo son had one ambition, to make it to a Legoland, and Malaysia was the closest so off we went. We (myself, my 22 and 12 yo sons) went on a Friday, catching the bus from Singapore (tip - book a couple of days out and they do leave bang on time whether you are there or not). The border crossing went more smoothly than I expected, about an hour and a half from the Singapore Flyer to Legoland, slighty longer coming back due to peak hour traffic. Huge carpark there if you are driving.Everywhere we had read to exchange your Singapore dollars for Malaysian Ringitts but we didn't have time and it wasn't a problem - just go to the nearest shop on site (and there are plenty scattered about) and but something small, like a keychain in SD and they give you change in Ringitts, fair exchange rate as well. Too easy. We were told to do the water park first as there was a thunderstorm expected and they close the water park if that happens. They have very secure lockers available to store passport, bags etc while you are enjoying the water. The park wasn't packed and the most we had to wait in line was about 15minutes. Not a lot of rides available, but that was ok as we were only spending the morning there. Getting into the build your own lagoon and floating around there was the perfect way to cool off after the bus trip. Any water is appreciated in the humidity. Would happily have spent longer but we had to see the main attraction. We had lunch at the water park, lucky for us it was Ramadan so no queues at the food stalls, not sure what it would be like for the rest of the year. Food was reasonable and tasty  (burgers, chips etc).Across to Legoland - Miniland is HOT! no shade so bring lots to drink and an umbrella wouldn't go astray. The Star Wars exhibit was drooled over by my kids, the only place we felt crowded all day but still not unbearably so. My kids aren't big ride fans so the tameness of the rides wasn't a problem but I could see it would be considered a bit dull by some teens. We spent maybe 3.5 hrs at Legoland,about the equivalent at the water park and that was just about the right amount of time for us. If we stayed at the hotel we would have spent far longer at the water park but probably not much more time in Legoland. Shops aplenty, not cheap but nice variety and of course that's always the highlight for the kids. Not sure if we would go again but would certainly recommend it for a day trip - very easy from Singapore.",4.0

2770,Paradise for kids,"Well, I've heard a lot of good feedback and read various about Legoland. Its really a nice themepark. I could not say I had the best of my life after visiting Legoland but to enjoy will always be yuor choice. I went here with few of my friends last March, and when I say friends I mean yuppies friends. Most of the rides and attractions are for kids. So this paradise is really for them to enjoy.So, we, most of the times were just taking pictures for blogs and reviews purposes.We specifically enjoyed the basketball, where one could get a really big minion or any stuffed toy of your choice just by shooting one ball. We've tried and spent every RM we have in our wallet, yet in the end we werent able to shoot even one for I don't know why. (Honestly, until now I'm still wondering how that happens, when I know I've got friends with a good basketball skills. I think there's a certain magic or spell in that certain game stall.haha) So, we've decided to stop and laughed it all out, that was embarassing. hahahaBut we enjoyed it.Later that afternoon, we found out that there is a certain play stall in the upper area of the themepark where one just have to catch fish for with a corresponding number in it, sum them all up for a bigger stuffed toy prize. As simple as that. haha. But the prize youll get, I think, will not be worth the fun. So I still go for basketball.We also tried to ride and visit dome attractions to collect stars as we were given a card play stamp. (this is for fun and collection purposes only, you do not necessarily have to do it too. haha)Anyway, take a quick peak of the miniature buildings, theyre really cute.Foods are limited but range to only RM10-RM30.All in all. It's not the place or the experience but the people you chose to spend it with that will make the visit worth the while.Well, there's never a dull moment when I'm with my friends/travel buddies.Have fun. :)",4.0
2771,Best Theme Park in the World!!!,"I love lego, so i am a little biased, but we seem to have got to the park on a quiet day, so we were able to go on rides multiple times, which was good because we didn't get there until lunch time. We had 2 children under the age of 5 and they both got to go on rides. Which is good because it only seems worth going to a theme park if everyone gets to have fun. It was fairly good price to get in and the pics from rides were not very expensive either. Plenty of things to do, but unfortunately didn't get to go to the water park due to time restraints but would have loved to because it looked awesome. But would recommend this park to everyone. There are also cheap stalls all over the place that you can pay to play carnival type games, everyone wins something (well almost everyone). It was a great day!! Would recommend to everyone and will definitely go again when in Malaysia next time.",5.0
2772,Good fun!,"Great time again, its not a huge park so its easily done in a day if not less, especially when its not busy, both times we went we didnt have to line up or wait which was perfect.. the service is brilliant all the staff are very friendly and helpful, our kids age 5&6 had a great great time THANK YOU!!",4.0
2773,"Thrilling Rides, Child Memories ","Legoland is a cool place, just Lego, and Lego.  There's thrilling rides for children and the torrent is the most exciting. There are also some roller coasters and rides.  For adults you can take pictures of Lego Figures scattered around the park!  Everything is cool there.  It is a must go plave with children.",5.0
2774,A must for young Lego fans,"We did a one day combo to Legoland and the waterpark and found it was a bit of a rush for the kids. Two days would have been perfect but we were pushed for time. Managed to do most things and the boys had so much fun. Our boys are 8 and (almost) 10 y.o. They could go on all rides, which was great. Food price was reasonable IMO and merchandises were also affordable however I wish Lego sets prices were cheaper than shops. We didn't buy any since I didn't see the point of buying full price when I often bought them cheaper at a sale.",5.0
2775,Great for kids,"Great attraction, especially for 5 to 12 year olds who love Lego Lego Lego ! We went on a week day and it was easy to get around with only short waits for attractions. All very clean and bright. Great visit !",4.0
2776,A nice place to hang out with kids,If you wanted to spend great time with kids .. then this is the place to go...especially if they are still in elementary schools then you can go no wrong with this place... lots of rides are fun rides.... not too scary so kids can be scary on the first try and enjoy the next rides with big smiles ... If you go there during rainy seasons ... focus on doing the outdoors rides first as the rides may be suspended due to weather conditions especially rains ... do the indoors later...It wll be good if you can spend time in the hotels as well ...  lots of Legos around the lobby or pools so kids can spend time playing with it and meet new friends ...The only downside is trees are still not fully grown yet (already > 3 years) ... place is still hot hot hot and humid ...  next 3 or 5 years maybe will be much better where trees in the park and surroundings are grown ...If you stay nearby.... get the annual pass ... will get you much much affordable ...,4.0
2777,So Much Fun,"you will love this place no matter how old you are. It is not that big, But you can spend your whole day here having fun. You will enjoy their rides, but most of the rides are for kids. It is very hot as well, so mind what you will wear.",4.0
2778,Two days of fun!,"I think a major part of our enjoyment was that we visited during the Malaysian school term. It meant that the park was practically empty and our children aged 4,7 and 10 did not have to line up for longer than 5 minutes. We went on every ride on the first day and did the waterpark on day two. A variety of rides to suit children 10 and under. Impressive Lego decor. We did eat in the park and it was good value for money. Staff were helpful and friendly. Will visit again but will certainly avoid peak times :)  ",5.0
2779,Lovely theme park,Love this place so much. Makes you wanna be a kid again =) The park is really for kids. No hardcore scary rides.Pure fun and lots of lego.Be sure to book the hotel coz its equally fun too =),4.0
2780,Awesome for young kids,"This place is ideal for yound children as all the attractions like driving school, boating school, roller coasters etc. cater to them. The rides are not scary and young ones can go on all of them. Older kids may find it a bore. The water park is very good. The slides are fast and good fun. Many slides to keep you going all afternoon",5.0
2781,"Great place for kids, not much for adults",Visited this place as a side trip from Singapore visit. Its a lovely place and kids would surely love everything.. the rides are good but not much for adults... Cartoon figures everywhere are amazing!

2784,Awesome ,"We are a family of 4 with 10 & 8 years old children, we stayed at Legoland for 6 nights from 15th to 21st September room 709. We loved the theme room and their bunk beds. Disco in the lift is another groovy touch. Legoland offer everything awesome for the kids. All the staffs are friendly and helpful, bell boys, front desk, conceinerg, room service, restaurants staffs and chefs..... all are sweet and friendly. Highly recommended for families with young children like us. ",4.0
2785,Fantastic day ,I spent a day here with my 2 young boys and they loved every minute of it. The rides are fantastic the Star Wars exhibit is one of the best I have seen. You can easily spend a whole day here. If going with kids I recommend the Legoland hotel which is a few minutes walk away. The food inside the park is average but didn't detract from a fabulous day . We will be back !! The Lego water park is great to ,5.0
2786,Legoland,"Probably worth the trip for family with young children. Not advisable for adults as there wasn't much activities. The park was not crowded even on a Sunday we went. We saw mostly family with children. The park was not lively and things were moving slow. The show-¬†NINJAGO & THE REALM OF SHADOWS was a disappointing one. There was more of a puppet show than anything else, with the performers following their puppets throughout the show.",3.0
2787,Paradise for Lego lovers!,"This was a surprise for my son 6 years old on our trip in Malaysia and it did not disappoint me or him! When we reached by taxi the nearest road, my son said ""Wow, look Mama it looks like a castle made of Lego, How funny it is!"" That was the Lego hotel where we did not stay, but then when he read the big name ""Legoland"" in the mountain and understood what was going on, his smile did not leave him for 2 days.  We spend the first day in the attraction park and the second in the water park, both very nice for kids.  The attraction are not made to entertain adults but Lego lovers.  As parent I really do appreciate the attractions where you can build Lego with your kid, an interactive moment to share with your child.  We loved it and my son wants to go back!",5.0
2788,Paradise for kids,"The check in experience was just awesome. There were tons of Lego pieces in the reception so my 7 years old headed straight to the play area while we could peacefully check in. The rooms are outstanding. Huge divided into two parts - one for the parents and the other with a bunk bed with an extra bed under the bunk. The decor of the room is as per the theme that you choose which is nice. The bathrooms are huge. 2 wash basin of 2 different height for adults and kids. There is a treasure box in each room. They have created a treasure hunt kind of concept to open the box. There is a sheet of paper with questions written on it. You can find the answers inside the room (carpet, wall, bed etc). Once you solve them, you will get the number for the combination lock of the treasure chest. Open it and the gift are for your kid to keep (let me not reveal the surprise).When you want to go to the park, just head to lower ground and walk into the park. If up have only 1 day to spend, I recommend you start as soon as the park open coz there is the water park and the amusement park. Ideally you should do what I did. Check in by 2 pm and headed to the water park (not as elaborate as the amusement park) and spend the afternoon there. Next day got up at leisure, had a super elaborate breakfast and checked out at 11pm. Kept our luggage at the hotel and spent the whole day at the amusement park. It works coz u anyway get a 2 day ticket for the price of one. So you can see everything and you and the kids are not too tired. Their staff is exceptional with service and attitude. While queuing up to check out, one of the staff came and said, your bills are all cleared so you can hand over your keys and leave. Really thoughtful I must say. Absolutely a must visit place if you have a kid!",5.0
2789,Great staff and fun for the family,"Staff were very helpful and friendly. The water park was a bit on the small side so it only takes up half the day. Most of the rides and attractions are catered to children so adults might find it a bit boring after a while. But if you want to enjoy a day of fun with your children, this place will be great for it.",5.0

2791,Lego Kids Dream,"This was my son's dream for the last 3 years and we made it from Australia recently. My kids (6.9) were at the perfect age to enjoy the array of rides. A few more years and my eldest may have found it too young for him. Any younger and my 6 year old would have missed many of the rides. Staff were fabulous. Shops were great! The cafe on the left as you enter has the healthiest food compared to the other yucky MSG soaked stuff. We went on every ride and it was fabulous, built lego racing cars, admired miniature world, gasped at Star wars models and generally got totally blown away and exhausted! So much fun.A lego kids dream. Thank you.",5.0
2792,Surprising,It was our first time to visit a 'Legoland'. We loved everything there. We went there for our first wedding anniversary and joined its VIP Tour! The tour was wonderful and informative. Special appreciation to all the staff there. It is also good for new couples to spend their honeymoon there. The Legoland Hotel is nice and interesting. We liked the Pirates Room so much!,5.0
2793,it is for family with kids and lego-lovers,"This is the place for those who's into lego, or families with children. All the attraction are just small for adults I guess, the meant to be ""lego-size"". Got the concept. The park is not too big, you can just finish 1 round in less than 3 hours. Price is still ok. Consider to bring a hat or an umbrella, it can be too hot for some people. The 3D movie is not that good, kinda boring. But you can shop legos there, which is nice.",3.0
2794,Not as fun & fantastic & happening compared with HK Disneyland BUT definitely worth to try,"Not as fun & fantastic & happening compared with HK Disneyland BUT definitely worth to try with kids, friends or love one. bring your own umbrella or get ready to get sun burn if you visit on day time & sunny day. bring your own towel, too IF you do not want to pay so much for a LEGOLAND Towel, which is not that special to me, am not sure about you :) Food wise consider , as lousy as most of the theme park, i,e universal studio.. because most of the time they serve hotdog bread, sandwiches , etc only. Anyway who expect good food from theme park? at least my friends and I are now, so we are satisfy with what we had. ",4.0
2795,Best for family visit ,I with my family visited Legoland JoharBahro in Januray. Weather was comfortable and mild. It is best to reserve one full day for Legoland however if you are also interested in water sports then best option is to keep two days as Legoland has adjacent full facility of water park. Legoland has to offer something for all ages and many team activities are available which gives best bonding time. Everything is marvelously made of lego bricks and free to play and touch with. My favorite was the enclosure in which lego models of various majestic real buildings were built. The tickets available at hotel counters are generally cheaper than those purchased from ticket counter at Legoland. Taxis are best option to visit and one can easily find a taxi both in the morning or evening to arrive and depart from the Legoland.A must visit site if one is visiting to Malaysia or Singapore being located in the border city of Johar Baharu,5.0

2797,Ok but too hot,"The rides are mainly for children. The 3D movie is not very good, too much water splashing throughout the whole movie. The entire theme park should have more shades, it's too hot and will easily get sun burnt. Advisable to take umbrella or wear a cap.The Miniland is interesting, it has all the main buildings around the world.

Great for kids, just as great for adults","We stayed one night in the Pirate themed family room at the resort and wished we stayed 2 so we can enjoy the facility and lego building activities in the hotel as well.

The lego display was mind-blowing.The water park was fun, could have spent a whole day on the lazy river escaping the heat. We went on a weekday, outside of school holidays, and found the park to be quite empty. There were no queues to the rides and were able to go multiple rounds without getting out. Had a great time here, and makes a nice is trip from Singapore..",5.0
2805,Awesome if you like Lego!,"First visit to a Legoland did not disappoint. We even did the rollercoaster rides by mistake and enjoyed every one of them. The only letdown was that the Lego sets that we wanted were sold out there. Although the tour was for the full day, half a day is more than enough. If you are doing the trip from Singapore, as we did, AVOID using a third-party and book directly with WTS travel at the Singapore Flyer. We made the mistake of booking through our hotel and the pickup never arrived, and we had to scramble to get a taxi to the flyer. We missed the first bus and the tour company never refunded us the taxi fare although they promised to do so.",4.0
2806,For the Kids and Lego enthusiasts,"For those with complete childhoods, Legoland is a great place to feel like a kid again. Legoland is filled with all sorts of replicas of real life places such as Ankor Wat or Taj Majal, and even of fictional places such as those found in Star Wars.Overall, it's a place for you to SEE. Rides are abundant, but they're mostly for kids. You wont enjoy this place if that's not what you're looking for.If you're coming from SG, there is a bus that goes to and from legoland under WTS Travel. Alternatively, if you need to go from Legoland to SG only, you can:- take a taxi- take a bus from Legoland to Johor Bahru Terminal (Legoland information has the bus schedule), the from JB, take Bus 170 to Singapore.Either way you'll have to go through immigration first.If you're looking for a thrill, Legoland is not the place to go. But if you have the money and the time, why not?",3.0
2807,Legoland Hotel,"Didn't actually enter Legoland but headed for the adjoining Hotel, due to lack of time - my son loved playing with the many brick-playboxes all around the place. He also pestered us to buy some Lego stuff at the Shop in the Hotel, which we did - together with a cool Dragon (yet again :D ) keychain!Same goes for me, as I grew up to Lego bricks together with my brother (i.e. reliving a big part of my childhood with my ""next generation"")! :)",5.0
2808,It's a Hot Hot Holiday,"It was our first time visiting Legoland, it was not too crowded on Friday. Most of the rides are cater for young children and we found there were only a few rides cater for adults.  It is a hot day in Legoland and it will be nice if the park has lot of mist fan or giant fan especially at the rest area or at the outdoor dining area. We adults can‚Äôt stand this type of hot weather, how about the young children, pity them. I'm a big fan of Ninjago so I‚Äôm truly excited to watch the 1st live Ninjago show here. When I reached the City Stage to watch the show, to my surprised there was no show at 11am but the schedule stated there is a show at 11am. I'm thinking how a big park like this can provide such an inaccurate schedule to the visitor. Imagine we have planned our rides and have to walk a long way back to the stage again in this hot weather. Legoland, please do not stated you have show at 11.00am but there wasn't in future. So we left and decided coming back for the next show. Luckily we were able to see the next show.  It was truly a great show, with state of the art backdrop and digital effects. Foods in restaurant are a bit pricey though, so don‚Äôt think of bringing your own food coz outside food are not allowed.  I like the Big shop as they have a varieties of Lego products. We passed by Castle and coincidently there are having a Halloween event. I‚Äôm lucky to have a picture shot with the Frankenstein Lego character. There was also a Halloween show but I find that the show a big disappointment, truly bored and not entertaining at all. So we left and continue with our rides again.  I'm truly impressed with Miniland, the model works are so fine. It provides a great photoshot backdrop. Overall I enjoyed my time here and I think I'm going back for the Waterpark in my next trip.",3.0
2809,Amazed!,"Whilst set up for younger children, our 13 yo enjoyed the day. We travelled by coach from Singapore having to clear immigration in both countries. The miniature reconstructions of incredible landmarks like Angor Watt were amazing and worth the time to go and see. The new Star Wars exhibition was fantastic as well. It was a hot day so we enjoyed the water rides and got soaking wet! Very clean bathroom facilities which was a big plus!",4.0
2810,Great day out - pity about the haze,Small enough to complete everything in one day. Big enough for variety. There were very few people there when we went due to school being back on and the terrible haze. We got to go on all rides at least once and sometimes even 4 times!!There was enough food variety. Was very enjoyable. Been to Windsor Legoland too and both good - just depends how far you can travel.,4.0
2811,Always a fun place,Went to water park. The rides are definitely suitable for family. There are many lifeguards around and they are actively watching the kids.Fun place.Theme park is always a fun place for kids. Rides are suitable for children.,5.0
2812,A great stop for the family.,"We stayed in the Legoland Hotel after travelling across from Singapore with WTS Tours (located at the Singapore Flyer). Our son is a Lego-addict and this theme pare thrilled him at 10 years of age. Our daughter is 12 and they both became immersed in different experiences. Legoland caters for a variety of kids: there were some younger rides and attractions which were mainly City based. Some more adventurous rides are located at the Kingdom and Technic areas. Overall, two days of exploring, coupled with cooling off at the waterpark was well worth it. There are so many lego displays too, far too many to describe.We would recommend staying at the hotel if you can as you can relax in the pool (on the fifth floor), dance away in the lifts and their was plenty to choose from at breakfast. Eating was not a problem at Legoland too for lunch and we stepped out into the mall located a short walk away for dinner each night.  The only bad thing we can report at this time of year is the haze problem. This is not a Malaysian or Singaporean caused problem though. It seems as though companies in Indonesia have been destroying their rainforest using unsustainable and selfish methods (burning) and the winds blow it over neighbouring countries. We really felt for the Malaysian and Singaporean people having to live through these types of conditions since the mid 70s.Otherwise, don't hesitate. Legoland is great!",5.0
2813,..a child's play..,I first came here in April 2014 with my kids and back again this time with my hubby.. There is not that much new and the food is quite pricy.. But my kids enjoyed it so much especially the robotics class that they had and so with the 4d shows that we watched.. the replica miniatures of well known architural designs are just great!,4.0
2814,Must visit for kids,"Legoland lived up to my expectations and for my kids it was a fabulous place. I had booked it for two days for both parts. This place is not crowded like Wanderla in India. You can do all activities with ease and as many times as you want.I loved the Ninza go show, the draggon roller coster, Fire department and all the cities models done in Lego pieces. The other best part was the star wars done in lego. That was very nicely done. The water park was fabulous and the slides were awesome. My kids, me and my wife thoroughly enjoyed it. We could spend complete 2 days here without realizing how the time went by.",5.0
2815,Short Getaway in Johor,"The park is not as big and mainly designated for children and young adult, although there are several rides (roller coasters and water rides) that we also enjoyed.

We got here from Singapore by bus to Johor Bus Centre Terminal then looked for the Tourist bus that goes through Lego Land and Hello Kitty Land.",3.0

2819,Must-visit for anyone with young kids,"We took our children, 2 and 7yrs to LEGOLAND and LEGO Water Park on a day trip from Singapore.  In hindsight, we now think we should've stayed overnight in the LEGOLAND Hotel, because we felt a bit pushed for time.Highlights undoubtedly the LEGO Star Wars MiniLand - seeing popular scenes of each Star Wars episode in Lego form blew our minds.  We loved the Water Park too, particularly in the Malaysian heat.  The big water slides were fabulous, and the wave pool.  I'd recommend spending an overnight at LEGOLAND resort, with one full day at LEGOLAND and another at the Water Park. We loved our experience at LEGOLAND Malaysia, and would absolutely visit again.",5.0

2822,Great place for young kids,"Young kids will love this place. For adults, not much to expect. Rather small, walk one round and is done. A few rides adult can play only, most of it for young kids. If you want to buy photos from them. Make sure you let the camera man to take more photos for you so that you can choose. Because they sell at combo, 4 for RM120. Buy 1 RM60.",3.0
2823,How about the food,"I'm going to focus on food because everyone else will cover the other aspects:Burger Junction - decent priced food. A Cajun grilled chicken burger or double cheddar cheese (more like a quarter pounder) each cost 28MYR and that includes cheese rings and a drink. Nuggets for kids with chips cost 18MYR. The food here is decently priced and definitely ok value at an amusement park.Indoor eating to escape the haze is at Market Restaurant at Lego City. Chicken Rice, Briyani Rice served with a drink and fruit comes in at 28MYR again. The chicken is a big maryland sized piece. Kids can eat here similarly for 18MYR choosing from a kids menu of spaghetti or smaller versions of adult menu. Again served with fruit and drink.Don't visit during haze season - you don't get any compensation and all you do is suck in fumes. When its 300 PSI it really stinks.",4.0
2824,A fun weekend with Family,Legoland was on the cards for a long time.. we had been specially planning this trip for months.. to celebrate my Son's 4th birthday.We spent three days at Legoland  having taken the Annual Pass...  Kids enjoyed every minute of their time spent there both at the Amusement & the Water Park too.  The ride operators are very energetic and take an effort to treat all their guests with care.  Despite being the weekend.. it was not overly crowded and we could enjoy the rides of our choice over and over again.  Recommend watching the  Ninjago - the Realm of Shadows (live performance) and the 4D Movies...  The only drawback is... there are several rides not suitable for kids under 102 cms.. as such my younger one was not very pleased to miss out on them...  Would request the Legoland management to invest in Kid Sized glasses for watching the 4D movies... as the generic size is not kid friendly at all.Overall it was a fun weekend.  We look forward to visiting again soon.,5.0
2825,like Lego? must visit!,"LegoLand is quite big theme park with attractive but expensive hotel, the place is quite remote from downtown area. Entry fee is reasonable, they perform this welcome dance each morning involving visitor's kids. They have many rides to try out and all of them are free, some of the rides are too short but some are okay. The most popular ride is the dragon rollercoaster, lego technik, ninjago show and the 4D cinema. Foods are available all over the place, it's very easy and price is okay. Not so much trees in the area, so beware if you are visiting during hot season. Staffs are nice and cheery, they are well trained and good hospitality. Do spend the whole day here and try out all the attraction and rides so you get the max of it.",4.0
2826,Loads of cuteness!,"We visited on a weekday and as a result, the park was nearly deserted. It would have been great but it was too hot.

2829,A must visit for the kids.,Wonderful place for the kids to be surrounded by Legos. They can use their imagination to make their toys and figures.,5.0
2830,Legoland Johar Bahru Malaysia,"A brilliant family location. Bright, colorful foyer and themed rooms. The resort and park staff were very friendly and helpful. Clean, well stocked rooms (although some may prefer to supply their own milk since a powder creamer is all you will get) We only ate the buffet breakfast which represented good value, good quality and in abundance featuring fresh local fruits, various curries and  of course, some western foods (cereal, eggs, sausages). We recommend the local food for that wonderful cultural experience. The park has child friendly attractions from the lazy river and slides in the water park to a serene train ride through the theme park to the dragon Rollercoaster. You will need at least two days to enjoy the entire park. All up, a great family environment with fun for all and good value too!!",5.0
2831,Legoland is Heaven for Families,"LEGOLAND Malaysia although somewhat of the way (at least half an hour from anywhere) it is worth the trip.  The LEGOLAND hotel is a must as is the park. The hotel staff, room, food selections were all excellent.  The only down side was that the hotel pool was closed for maintenance during the time that my family was there.As for LEGOLAND Malaysia park it was amazing not just for my son but for the Dad as well.  You will need two days to get the full LEGO experience and to try out everything that the park has to offer.The only let down was the Water Park with to many people in the water at one time with no control on numbers and/or what people are bringing into the water.To many people in the pool created a form of 'human soup'. To say that this was quite repulsive would be an understatement.Do yourself a favour and concentrate on the hotel and the park.Forget the waterpark unless you want to be part of human soup.",5.0
2832,Family fun for all,"What a fun place for a family. We had a great time with our young teenage kids. It does get very hot here, so I would highly recommend buying the double park ticket that enables you to visit the water park as well. ",5.0
2833,Good attraction pity the exposure to the weather,"Brought my daughter age 3+ to this attractions over the Labour day Holiday.  She enjoyed herself as there are a lot of rides that she can go on.  Surprisingly there wasn't a crowd even though it is a public holiday, she took a few rides more than once.  However, the place has little shelter from the sun and it is even worst when we were caught in the sudden thunderstorm in the afternoon.  It will be good if the management can consider building more shades / shelter in the park.",3.0
2834,Good for kids and baby,We are going to legoland johor bahru from singapore.We decided to try with bus from queens street(causeway link yellow bus).Its easy from singapore.Only 3.4sgdThe problem was after arrival at johor really not recomended do a bus..too long.If you go with taxi apx about 50RM(11usd)Better ..if you travelling with group familly.The park was not too big .good for kids Especially if they were lego fans.The best part was the ninjago show. Its live show.Overall its good for kids..altough its gona be very tired trip with your kids from singapore to do 1 day trip,4.0
2835,Legoland,"It's a big place and actually good for outdoor activities.  No doubt it looks nice at the entrance, but not so attractive as it appears to be.  Parking facilities not so convenient.",3.0
2836,Nice theme park,"We enjoy this theme park eventhough we came during the hazy day in the morning. Maybe because it hazy, so the visitor is very less than usual. So we can enjoy the rides without queing for long time. Our kids (3,5 years and 7,5 years) love the rides so much! This park is not as big as Disneyland Hongkong or the other. But its giving the kids fun with the variety of the rides. We took about 5 hours to enjoy almost all the rides inside. There is a several restaurant. We try the Italian restaurant and its taste good. Its quite hot because the tree isn't growing up yet I think. You should get your hat or sunglasses. For overall, we love this themepark!",5.0
2837,Great for family with young kids,"great place to spend a day for families with young kids.watch out for some of the slides at waterpark. inclines are too subtle causing people to get stop sliding halfway, can be scary if you are in the middle of a covered tube slide. many lifeguards but not well trained in how to respond when a young kid did not emerge at the bottom of the slide tube for a good few minutes causing panic for her father who frantically ran up and down to both ends of the slide to find his daughter.some of the rides in the theme park are too fast/scary for small kids, use discretion as in all themeparks.lockers are tad expensive at RM20per day for small one (can be reopened multiple times). if you use a locker at the waterpark and have a combo ticket you can leave your stuff there but remember to bring your tucket along for rentry.  take note that the waterpark closes at 6pm while the themepark closes at 7, and by 6 the side entrance directly linking the 2 parks is closed so you have to exit the theme park main exit and take the long way (abt 5mins wall) to the waterpark to retrieve your stuff. lockers at the themepark has option for RM10 for 3hours and some for Rm5 for 1hour or so, but not the ones at the water park (only rm20 for small and 40 for large one per day)if you drive and park at the parking zones 1or2, do not linger too long after park closes as we found our car to be the only one in the vast carpark after dinner at 8pm. parking at zone one or two are at Rm10 per entry. you might want to consider parking at medini mall next to legoland hotel at rm4 per day. actually it is closer.road signages are not consistent at every junction as you approach so do check your gps or maps.food and beverages like in many theme parks are pricey. est rm20-30 per pax per meal. if you have combo ticket you may want to hop out to adjoining medini mall for food.website mentions family ticket 2adults get 1child free, was not available at ticket counter (online purchase only)malaysians (mykad) pay 4ringgit above 7day advance tickets but get rm10 food vouchers. BUT there was a better deal for maybank card holders at 35% off which i did not notice on the website. counter crew were helpful. ",5.0

2839,Goood place for kids & LEGO fans,This a place for kids. It is a must see place if your child is a LEGO fan. Many rides and attractions are coming up. Construction is on. You also have to stay in the resort to appreciate the place better. There is a shopping mall just opposite to the theme park entrance and you have some really good restaurants out there.,4.0

2841,"Great holiday for the family, the kids will love it!","As we were travelling from Singapore, we also booked roundtrip bus tickets with WTS Travel. The trip wasn't too long, and the bus was clean & comfortable.  We left the Newton Circus carpark at 9am and got there at around 11am.  We first looked for a money exchange counter to get some local currency then stopped at a restaurant in the mall for a quick lunch.  Then proceeded to the Legoland theme park but was recommended by the entrance staff to head over to the water park first due to the weather.  Great advice!  The water park was awesome!  Even if you are not a lego fan, you will be blown away by the sheer effort they made to make the place almost a dreamland for kids. At the Build A Boat station, kids can make their own boats & watch them sail along the river.  My son loved the Build A Raft river where you can just float around the river that wraps around most of the water park.  There are plenty of slides for teenagers & adults too.  We only had a day for both parks so we headed off to the theme park too.  Plenty of rides, shows & activities to keep both kids & adults interested. We especially liked the Star Wars exhibit.  A great holiday for the family, certainly there is something for everyone to enjoy!",4.0
2842,Good day out with family,"We were in Singapore for a weeks holiday and decided to go to Legoland for the day.  It was a really enjoyable day out although it was very hot so we had to take plenty of breaks out of the sun.The park is incredibly clean and well maintained.  The rides we fun and there was plenty of activities for small kids as well as older children and adults.  The Star Wars mini-land display was excellent.  The Asia-themed mini-land in the centre of the part was really well done and the models of the buildings was impressive.  Look out for Iron Man in the port model. :-)The staff were friendly and very helpful throughout the park. We went during the week so there weren't that many people there and there were very limited waits on the rides.  Given the heat, this was a real bonus.We organised the tickets through our hotel in Singapore which was easy and convenient.  Well worth the day out if you are in Singapore with kids.",4.0
2843,Best place  for kid!!,If u go to lego with the kid will be good...If not.... I'm not recommend  coz.. This place  special  for the kids with  family . .. thus please  easy  to go from  Singapore  ,4.0
2844,Needs some investment on the original features,"This was our 2nd visit, the first was a year ago. It is looking significantly faded and in need of some investment this time around. The kids won't notice, they will still have fun but when viewed from an aesthetic point of view, even the classic primary colours were looking faded in the sun. I hope the behind the scenes maintenance of the rides is consuming the budget and that the standards remain adequate. The Marketplace 'restaurant' was very poor quality food and the drinks (excluding water) were quite high in artificial sugar for a kids restaurant. At peak times the queues are longer that those of the rides where they could easily have double the number of open tills. Some of the photos available are very good and the gift shop remains of a good standard thanks to the Lego brand. The staff were generally above average and welcoming / helpful.In my opinion this is now a poor reflection of the Lego brand in terms of durability and appearance after a few years wear and tear. We won't be rushing back but when in Malaysia I'm sure the kids will still want to visit. If we do, we won't be staying at the hotel for a 3rd time (see separate review). There are many other excellent options at half the cost and twice the quality.",3.0

2848,Awesome fun ,"Had a family of 5 with the eldest 9, middle child 6 and youngest 3. It was so much fun for the whole family.  More suitable for the 9 to 6 year old. It wasn't crowded at all on a Tuesday so it was easy to get around and on the rides. The rides were very age appropriate too. The price of entry I thought was cheap compared to what we are used to. We caught a private taxi from Singapore using Singapore Taxi Services and they were great also. Took about 1 hour to get there from Sentosa and most of this time was customs and immigration. One of the most enjoyable family days we have had for ages. The staff there were very friendly and helpful and food there was a reasonable quality and cheap prices.",5.0
2849,Suitable for kids and young at heart,"we visited the park as a group of couples. highly recommended for kids as most of the park's rides and attractions are targeted to... well, kids. every attraction can be done within half day. must visit when dropping by johor...you can also opt to get the 1 day water park and legoland pass which could save you a lot of time and money. water park can be done in a half day.",4.0
2850,Lots of fun at the parks,This was our third time to legoland parks and it was lots of fun and many things for the family to enjoy together!The parks are clean and improving from time to next time.We like our time at the water park so much...kids like the water plays...slides...However I would like to suggest that the there should be private places like the ones there but less in price.If we are at the water park we have to leave our stuff in a public open place and most of the place rented for the restaurants.The private tents there that you pay i think 300 RM per day...6 of them or even more and the occupancy is little.Better make cheaper ones without the safe or the fridge just for families to have decent private places to sit/eat/leave our belongings without worrying..It can be 100 RM and I'm sure it will be more useful!,5.0
2851,Fun day out for the big kids,"This is really for the kids and for adults who still are in touch with their inner child. Rides are enjoyable, not crazily scary that you are too scared to enjoy. Best part of it was it was not crowded when we went so we didn't have to spend loads of time queuing. Some carnival game tents around with prizes to be won but the games are expensive. But for the fun of it.. Why not? Food inside the park is aplenty and reasonably priced. ",4.0
2852,Marvellous Lego Adventure for kids,"The place was hot and humid as the trees are not fully grown to give shady pathways. The park has many interesting activities / rides for kids n family to participate and bonding. Children will definitely enthralled with the rides. The waterpark itself they can have fun too!

It is an enjoyable and fun trip for the kiddos!",4.0
2853,Good One Day Park,Nice park for 1 day.  Don't really need multi-day passes.  We did the waterpark and Legoland with our kids.  Better for kids from 4-10.  The older kids didn't really get into it so much.,4.0

2856,Mostly for the kids,U went there back when it first opened and it was really cool and fun howerver I only think that 1 or 2 of the rides are suitable for people over 10 years old so its not really fun for teenagers but more for the kids. Overall it was cool and fun but mostly cool.,4.0
2857,Hot but nice outdoor park ,"I visited Legoland with my daughter in July. We were all soaked and sweated in the whole trip since the weather was miserably hot. So remember to prepare few t shirts as back up to change. Nevertheless, generally that whole trip was interesting. My daughter loves Dinoland most. Water park was another highlight. Convenient stores were all around so not necessary to carry much in the trip. Highly recommend to visit the park after October or November, as the weather will not be so hot. ",5.0
2858,"Not just a wonderful outdoor playground, but excellent indoor too","Much has been praised about the LEGOLAND theme parks anywhere in the world: fun-filled, lots of excitements, place for family bonding etc - and a lot of those are outdoor.  In this review, I would just like to add another aspect: the indoor excitements of LEGOLAND.We came from Singapore to LEGOLAND Malaysia in a hazy day when the smog level in the air in Singapore was near-hazardous to people's health.  Johor Bahru was a little better but still hazy.  We spent most of our time indoor in LEGOLAND, and there were still a lot for us to do.  Our son loved the ""car making"" experiments in Imagination area, then we went next door to watch a few Lego shows in 4D cinema - they were all clever, child-friendly and drew a lot of giggles.  The new Star Wars miniland is an extremely well-done addition to the theme park, with lots of information and models.  Last but not least, we watch a stage show ""The Realm of Shadows"" by Lego Ninjago - a show with large-size Lego puppets and spectacular lightings/special effects.  In conclusion, even in adverse weather, families will still have a lot to do indoor at LEGOLAND, and that's super helpful - from perspective of a parent.",5.0
2859,Theme park very suitable for children,"I would give it a 4 star as the theme park is very suitable for my son's age - 8 years old. They have a lot of kiddie rides for the children but I think the rides are not very thrilling for teenagers and adults. My son enjoyed the boat ride and the car circuit ride. The merchandise were expensive and with some of the stores in open air environment, the merchandise were dusty. The Lego displays that the staff of the theme park painstakingly put up also looked worn and dusty. The structures were nice but I think the management has to step up on maintenance and cleaning. Overall, we enjoyed the theme park, it was hot though, so bring lots of drinking water along if you are visiting the park. Stay hydrated!",4.0

2861,Amazing Theme Park,"A quiet Monday in Sep, the park did not have many visitors and no queue at any fun spots. Most of the games are more suitable for the kids and teenagers and mature people would be fasinated in taking photos with the Miniworld and Lego characters. Food in restaurants is not expensive but the sofa in the restaurant is quite dirty, probably didn't clean properly after dining. Though the Lego characters in the park are nice and funny, the souvenir in the shops are boring and expensive. The best souvenir is a personalized Lego brick key chain... boring, huh?",4.0

2864,Great outing for younger children,"My family and I finally decided to pay Legoland after hearing good things about it from friends. But, we were also wary of the heat that many people had complained about. So, we made sure we had our sunblock with us, and enough water to last us through the day (unlike the Magic Kingdom, Legoland does not provide water-refilling stations). There are restaurants and a convenient store at the Mall of Medini where you can eat and buy things just before you enter Legoland.Overall, Legoland is great fun if you are travelling with younger children. My daughter, who is eight, thoroughly enjoyed herself. We were worried about the crowds because it was the weekend but the time we were there, there were hardly any, so queue times were short and we could go for rides that we liked more than  once without having to wait long. We went to almost all the rides, and really, the majority of them are geared towards the younger set.Highlights were Dino Island (be prepared to get really soaked, so bring a change of clothes), the Dragon (a rollercoaster), the Dragon's Apprentice (a slightly less heart-thumping version of the Dragon), and Project X (an almost vertical drop inside a 'race car'). We also enjoyed the Ninjago live performance which is supposed to be the park's newest attraction. We didn't do all the indoor activities centres as we were saving them for later if it rained (it didn't). Perhaps, we'll check them out in another visit.  There were also more funfair-like games scattered throughout the park which I thought did not really blend in with the whole concept of Legoland. All in all, well worth spending a day for some outdoor thrills and fun.",4.0
2865,Fun except for unpleasant encounter with staff ,"We came back from a weekend stay at Legoland and my boys completely loved it. From the rides to the displays and the nice hotel deco, absolutely great for kids.Unfortunately I experienced a jarring incident while at the Water Park. While waiting for my turn at the long green slide (the narrow one with the blinking green lights inside, forgot the name of it) the attendant there carefully ogled me from top to bottom (was wearing a conservative tankini mind you, nothing skimpy) and waited until my husband slid down the slide and I was alone before proceeding to ask  ""You Chinese, ah?"". My immediate reaction was to ask him why did it matter to which he just smirked. Needless to say was pretty shocked by this - what does my race have to do with anything? Thoroughly enjoyed the park with my kids but the employees really to be told to refrain from this kind of behaviour. ",3.0
2866,Fun filled place!,"Water park was great with lots of Water Slides in the play area. Would be good if the quality of the water is properly maintained.

2867,Good place for children 5-13 years old,"There are a lot of things in Legoland to offer to the children 5-13 years old. For teenage or adults, there are also many rides to experience. My son, 5 year-old, loves the place so much and I got him the annual pass for multiple entry. The only thing is the weather in Malaysia is rather unpredictable. It could be very hot sometimes, and it may rain. So to prepare an umbrella, rain coat, sun hat and sun block are essential.",4.0

2871,Lots of fun for both the adults and children ,"My husband and I visited Legoland with our nieces (aged 2.5 years and 5.5 years). We spent a large proportion of the day at the water park so the two year old could do plenty of activities. She was occupied the whole time although too small for the water slides. The five year old could do all the slides (I think with adult supervision) and had a fantastic time. At the main Legoland park there were plenty of rides the five year old could do (but we didn't have time to do them all) but not so many for the little one (though she napped so this wasn't an issue). Much better selection of food available at the main park than the water park, and there is a large dining mall just outside both parks that is good for dinner after the parks close.",5.0

I e-mail them right away and told to double check.and I was waiting a week after.and when we visit the park I also spoke to one of their staff because I didn't received any email about my concern regarding the double charged.So they we're apologizing about this matter and they're asking me to provide a statement of account to prove that i was debited twice.I called also my bank about this matter and heard their side provide me also a bank of statement that I should shown to the legoland management..I'm really pissed of about this,because it feels that they dont bother because the tour is already finished..and it was terrible experience and hassle for my side because it was also my first time to book online and was debited twice moreover is not on third party online ticketing.its directly purchasing ticket thru their website!",1.0

There are restaurants in the theme park and the people there are all very friendly. Price for a day is not cheap though, an adult theme park entrance fee is RM165 and food inside is about RM30/pax. Though there are buildings and some activities are in aircon rooms, most of the outside are without shades and can be very hot in the humid weather.

There were scheduled live shows too, make sure you don't miss it, as they were pretty good.  The canteen served a good variety of food suitable for both adults and young children.  That marked the end of our morning activities. We went on to explore the water park.  We started off at the locker room, where you could keep all your belongings.  I can say the locker system is well design and very user friendly.  We went on to hit the play areas and my two boys were exhilarated.   There were a variety of slides and playgrounds suitable for all ages of children.  It was fun and safe for children to enjoy themselves.   By the time my boys had tried everything,  it was already 5pm and we were ready to pack and go.  I would strongly recommend Legoland to family with young children!",4.0
2880,Great place for kids to play ,"This is my 3rd visit to the park. It's not as crowed as before but definitely good for us cos the kid don't need to queue a long time to play the games. Visited the park at 11am and finished around 4.30pm... We didn't manage to visit the mini world as the kids we tired. My kids had a great time. Most rides were minimum from 4yrs onwards, so maybe they should only be charging for kids from 4yrs onwards instead of 3yr üòÅ. ",4.0
2881,Legoland Malaysia,Better than expected. After hearing all the bad review for earlier visitors.The rides are suitable for young kids. The shows are boring. the miniture replica of famous building around the world build with Lego is interesting. Lucky enough to pay 50% discount for entry to theme park. But would I go again and pay RM135 for entrance. Answerr is nope. But would I do it once for experience. Answer is OK lah...,4.0
2882,Interesting theme park,"Visited Legoland Malaysia during year end school holiday just to fulfill my daughter's wish. Aged 10, she is just suitable enough to enjoy all ride at the dry park. Those who planned to visit this park must really check the age and height of your child as not all ride is allowed for certain age. You must also pay attention on the weather cos if it's happened to be heavy rain and thunderstorms, 80% of the ride will be shut down for safety reason and no refund will be made. We went there on day trip and spent a whole day out in the dry park enjoying almost all rides from 10am-7pm. We did not visit the wet park. Probably it'll be better if you stay overnight at their hotel then you will be able to enjoy both the dry n wet park.",4.0

2884,Great place to spend the day with kids,"We came during the Singapore Sept holidays, and were pleasantly surprised with the lack of crowd. Most rides only need to wait for less than 5 mins and some we could do more than three times consecutively! Kids love the baby dragon ride and the Beetle bounce ride at the Egyptian area. Girls also love the horse rides. ",4.0
2885,Good theme park for kids above 4 years old,Staff are friendly. There are a lot of ride suitable for kids above 4 years old. The park is big enough to stay there to play for a day.,5.0
2886,Excellent for a family with young children,"My 4 yo son really loves this place. From the rides, playground, foods etc. He has nothing to complain about this place :)For me, I like this theme park for its high safety standard applied to the rides. Safety is very important when it comes to children. I also like their system which seems to put children in their best interest. For example, when queing for a ride, children can play lego or watch film while their parent stand in line queing for them. And the theme park is clean n nice  to walk around. Tips:- It's hot in Legoland. So do come prepared. Hats, Sunblock, long sleeves are among nescesitties.- Some attractions are air conditioned. And so are the restaurants. Just head in there n cool off when the heat got too hot.-Stay hydrated. Bottled water can be expensive there. So bring your own bottled water n put them in your bag (they didn't check for bags in the gate)- Tune hotel Danga Bay is a good choice to stay if you're an out of towner.

2890,Great Park for young kids,"My children, ages 8 and 4, absolutely enjoyed Legoland Malaysia. Apart from being Lego lovers, the theme park catered to my children's love for rides and attractions. The lego stuff is also amazing! Starwars and the Miniland exhibits are the best! Only downside to this place: older kids and adults will not find the rides exceptional and thrilling. The park is best left for the younger ones. :-/",5.0
2891,Awesome theme park!!!,"It was one of the best places we've been to. It has something for every age group and the staff were very accomidating. My 2 little girls 3 n 5 years loved every minute of it. We ran a little behind schedule so didnt get to experience every ride, but what we did get to do was definatley worth the money. Would go vack again whem we visit malaysia again. Thank you legoland!!!",5.0

2893,An excellent amusement park ,"We visited both parks with our 3 and 4 year old children and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The rides were good and the water park was fantastic.

2897,Very nice place for kids!,"I have read many bad reviews before going there. Therefore I didn't have high expectation when I went there. But to my surprise, this is a really great park! One day is definitely not enough for both parks. Dry park really worth visiting, although it's a bit small for a theme park. But the rides were really fun and suitable for kids. Water park is not worth visiting. It is way too small and noting much to play with. Cons: Park is really really hot. Not much shaded area and you better bring hats, sunblock, sunglasses. Also, the food is expensive for a Malaysian standard. 1 personal pizza + soft drinks + mushroom soup cost RM 30+. Mineral water RM5. No outside food allow. So you will have to prepare to spend more in the park. Nonetheless, I still think it's a nice place to visit. Best to stay at their hotel if you do not have a car. Public transport might cost  a bomb as well.",4.0
2898,So hot but oh so fun,"Went here during the Malaysia Independence day last Monday, surprisingly the park is not crowded at all. The park is clean and all the staffs are very nice. The surau is located through out the park, roomy and air-conditioned. My 6 and 7 yo daughters really enjoy their adventures here. They were able to play all the rides. Even my 60 yo mother in law can play along, except for the roller coasters. Food is surprisingly not too expensive, and quite satisfactory to our palates. We were lucky to go there on national holiday, otherwise we wouldn't be able to complete all the rides. We came around 10 and exited exactly at 7, when the park began to close.The only downfall was the lack of exclusive legoland malaysia merchandise.",4.0

The theme park is not too big, we spent 1,5hrs at the waterpark. and Spent the rest of the day from 1pm-7pm at the theme park. and we enjoyed it, as when we were there, no lines, and less people in d park. so enough time for us to enjoy the park slowly. The park is HOT, i believe many reviewers already mentions it before. But it was not bad, as we entering the places with d the ac if we got tooo hot. there is some rides with ac. The food was good enough for theme park with reasonable price for theme park (drinks 5RM and food kids meal 18RM).The park is clean and well maintaned. But since there is nothing much we can do at the kota iskandar (the city where legoland at), i think 1 nites is enough. and try to stay at the legoland hotel. Is more confinient. ",5.0

2906,Loads of fun for the family,"I bought a 2 day pass online. Being a Malaysian I would have saved more had I stood in line for the MyKad discount. Not much of a queue on Aug 30 & 31 (Merdeka weekend). We began with the water park on the 1st day 1030 - 2pm - lunch - 2/3 of dry park till 7pm. On the 2nd day we were there from 1030 - 3pm and we revisited some of the rides & did the 3D & 4D live show.The staff were very child friendly & helpful. The kids had a really good time overall. Highlights were: the 4D show, Build & Test, Driving School & Project X. Only do the Mindstorm if your child is 10 or older. Lego City is generally for younger kids below 6. The water park is something the whole family can enjoy from the toddlers to adults. Its hot so prepare sunscreen, hats,  hydration salts & I brought snacks (apples & gronola bars). The food is expensive and its the usual fast food. We ate a big breakfast, made do with lunch at the park & headed out for dinner.The kids were really tired after the water park. In retrospect we could have done 1/3 instead of the 2/3 of the dry park on the 1st day. However because they did some enjoyable rides on the 1st day they knew what to head for on the 2nd. Its worth it if you have kids 7 & above. The ques at the wet park were longer than the dry park rides. Overall a real memorable trip for the whole family.",4.0

2908,a very fun day!,"this place is a must for lego-lovers. We were there on a weekday, it was still crowded but not terrible, the lines were between 5-10 minutes long. It can get unbearably hot in the afternoon, I wished they had more of the cooling station. The wave racer is the only ride over water that is allowed for us who didnt buy passes to the waterpark and it was a lot of fun. we did get wet and were dry within minutes in the hot sun. Sunscreen is a must. We brought our own water but we ended up wanting ice cold drinks all the time, and since this is a theme park, the F & B items are overpriced however worth every penny.They have a few coasters, nothing overly crazy. My 7 years old enjoyed going on all the roller coasters. I find the staff to be very helpful and there's plenty of them. I wished the opening times/closing times are changed. 10am is a bit late to start since by 11.30am, its gets so uncomfortably hot and the rides are mostly outdoors. We had to skip some rides because the seats were burning hot from the sun. They close at 6pm on a weekday, this should also probably be extended to 7pm like the weekends since its also nicer in the evenings. We skimmed through miniland since we didnt have enough time, however the guards/staff were super nice and didnt shoo-ed us or the other people away. The Lego hotel was exorbitantly expensive when we were there so we stayed elsewhere, however its still worth checking out the lobby area. covered parking at RM30 for the whole day is very reasonable.",5.0
2909,Good theme park for kids,"This place is great for little kids. The roller coasters are fairly benign (but that's probably because it is catered to kids), not as scary as the ones in Universal Studios in Sentosa, Singapore. ",5.0

2911,stay at the Legoland hotel to save time,"We bought the combo pass which allowed us access to both the theme park and the water park.  Neither park was crowded and we didn't have to wait very long, if at all, for any of the rides at either park.  The parks were not very big and not very accessible but makes a good side trip from Singapore.",5.0
2912,Must see place for lego-lovers.,"From Singapore, we booked a day tour to Malaysia. Surprisingly, the cost of the theme and water park package is just as much as two transformers ride in Universal Studios. The day however was worth it. I loved especially the giant slides at the water park. There's KFC inside the park too. :D If you are a tourist in Singapore and would like to go on a day tour to Malaysia, the best place to book and make reservation is at the Singapore Flyer. It's much cheaper there and all tge bus are there too. They could arrange everything in order all you have to do is just follow all the instructions given. :)",5.0

2915,Lego Entertainment and Happiness Everywhere,"The theme park is not too crowded, but there are plenty of things to do. Most of the rides are for children as there aren't too many thriller roller coasters, but young adults and adults alike can still be entertained. Aside from all the rides, grab your cameras and prepared to be memorized by all the Lego statues and figurines. There are a lot of photo opportunities with all the amazing structures of famous characters, stories, and places all over the world. Just wait until you reach the end of the theme park where you can see landmarks all over the world built out of Legos as this is truly astonishing.There are places to eat, and the pizza place in the park is good for children and adults. There are a lot of snacks, just like in an old fashioned American theme park. The themes in Legoland Malaysia are plenty and can keep you entertained. There's also a water ride in the back of the park (separate from the water park) and a heater to dry your clothes in case you don't have an extra set.The staff members of Legoland Malaysia were always friendly and great with children. They were always smiling around the park and ready to help. I recommend coming here if you're looking to be entertained in Johor Bahru, even from Singapore. It's the less crowded park compared to Universal Studios in Sentosa Island, Singapore.",4.0
2916,A must visit place for lego fan ,The theme park is good. There is also waterpark (we didn't go there but it looks like fun). The staff was very helpful.

Dont forget to go to lego driving learn where your kid can get their own legoland driving license ,3.0
2917,Nice Theme Park,"Perfect place for Lego lover like me. Lol. But I would suggest that you book your tickets earlier so you can enjoy the park less crowded.

2919,Nice theme park,Nice themepark. Altough most of the rides are for families with litltle children. Ours are at about 11 and 10 but we had a nice day. Rides are ok. I liked Star Wars and Little Asia most. Very well build. Food and drinks are good at very well prices (Disneyland Paris could teach a lot of it). Prices for the Lego however are not really interesting. On the internet or most Toyshops (in europe) you can get better prices. However if your in the Singapore/Johor Bahru Area then Legoland is worth a visit.,4.0
2920,Great place to spend the day,"Whilst we were in Singapore we'd planned to visit LEGOLAND. Unfortunately, the process to get from Singapore into Malaysia wasn't a smooth ordeal from the point of view of having to go through two custom/immigration points one on the Singapore side and the other on the Malaysian side. Just something to keep in mind. And according to others I'd spoken to our 3 hour ordeal was nothing compared to 8 hour ordeals experienced by others! But that has nothing to do with LEGOLAND! LEGOLAND is a great day out for the family the kids (girls 4 and 8) enjoyed the park overall, it's quite interactive and hands on - as one might expect. Very easy to spend a whole day here. The only downside was that to access the adjoining water park was an additional $60/person to upgrade from the passes we already had.",5.0

Hotel guest can access to the park half and hour earlier from the opening hour. The kids enjoyed themselves especially the elder one. There were lotsa rides, activities and playgrounds that the kids can have fun. Apply lotsa sunscreen when you're there. It was super sunny when we went and we came back tanned although we applied sunscreen. O_OI would think this is a great place for family with young kids but probably not for the teenagers as most of the rides and playgrounds are designed for young children. It might be boring for the teens.",4.0
2923,Legoland-- must-visit theme park,"Legoland Malaysia is a must-visit when you are in Johor Bahru (or even in Singapore).  It was worth the few hours drive from Kuala Lumpur.  The resort is generally made for kids, including the ""driving school for kids"" and several areas where they can play with lego bricks and make automobiles or robots.  Adults can have fun too with the 4D movies, rides and Miniland area which are actually scaled versions of popular Southeast Asian destinations made entirely of Lego.  It is best to go on a regular weekday to avoid long lines and so you can appreciate the beauty and cleanliness of the theme park.  Staff have also been very friendly.",5.0
2924,Fantastic spot for kids!!,Operating hours need to be extended.Deal: Get the combo for both theme parks. Go to water park first and the theme park later. Be there during weekdays as weekend will be pack and you will spend your time queuing. Car park: Big enough to accommodate the tourists.,5.0
2925,Well worth a day out.,"Went up for the day, took about an hour and a half to drive there from Singapore. Hired our own car and drove ourselves. Worried that the border would be difficult but actually it was a very smooth process. Very easy driving. Wide roads and quite a fast speed. Got to the resort quicker than we thought. Didn‚Äôt expect much but we were pleasantly surprised it was a great resort. We only went to the Legoland; didn‚Äôt go to the waterpark and wish we had. It looked very good, but we didn‚Äôt bring water gear. The rides are excellent. It‚Äôs warm, particularly a bit humid because it‚Äôs Malaysia, but I‚Äôd have to say it was relatively quiet. We were able to get on all of the rides. Had a fantastic time and then slept in the car on the way back to Singapore. I highly recommend this resort. It‚Äôs well worth a day out, particularly if you make it a full day by adding on the water park. There are hotels there but it was no problem really to travel from Singapore into Malaysia. Very good theme park and I would recommend this to anyone thinking about doing something a little bit different when in Singapore.",4.0
2926,Great Family Day,"We went on an organised tour from Singapore to Legoland, Malaysia which meant going via customs. It took close on an hour to clear Singapore customs before continuing onto Legoland. When we got their we found the facilities were clean and their was not much of a wait for rides. Admittedly we went mid week and not in a holiday period. Our children (7 & 9) enjoyed the day but I am not sure if teenages would thoroughly enjoy the experience. We found that a day was sufficient to enjoy the park and the meals/ drinks were not overly expensive. We converted $200 (Australia) to Malaysian currency prior to going and this was ample for a family of four. Overall it was a great experience.",4.0

2929,Great for Young Kids,"We took the bus day tour from Singapore (from the Flyer) at 8:30AM, which made for a big day. A big frustration for us was immigration, particularly entering / exiting Singapore which perhaps cost us over an hour - but this is not what the review is about. Legoland itself was a really good day. We arrived close to midday and got around the rides quickly - most queues were 5-10 minutes. Our kids are 3 and 5 - the 5 year old was able to go on everything and the 3 year old was able to go on more than half the rides. I can see how teenagers wouldn't get much out of this place though - unless they were lego geeks.The park is well set out, and we were able to say we had done just about everything we wanted to by the time we had to leave (5PM). After a massive day of queues at Universal Studios this was a really good experience. The one tip I would suggest people consider is the Legoland hotel. We didn't stay there, but it looked really good and it would have also meant we could have avoided the Singapore/Malaysia immigration stop which was much more painful than we expected.",4.0
2930,Excellent place for kids,"It's a great place for kids for sure, kids must love. Rooms are specially decorated and my son likes the in-room guessing game which a little gift when figure out the magic number to open the save.I found the restaurant is so-so, food quality not very good may be we were at their peak season. I recommend eating outside, just 10 mins walk from the hotel you will find a shopping mall which has local, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, Burger, etc. and price a lot cheaper.Its Water Park is also a must do thing that parents and kids would like it. Can spend a day in the park though. They only serve fries, burger, soft drinks and ice cream there, no other choice of food.If you are going to stay at Singapore and Legoland, I would recommend you book a taxi / private coach service who can drive you from SG to Legoland because Legoland is just 30 mins driving distance from SG border, it's actually more convenient to travel from SG.Hope my comment helps and hope you enjoy your trip.",5.0

We arrived around 10AM here. not a lot of people was here when we were there. which is good, so you can ride without waiting for lines.We bought the ticket for both water park and the rides. We went first in the water park. lots of families was there. will sure go back here to swim in their water park.We just stopped swimming after rain came down around noon.after the rain, we tour the park itself and my son was the one riding most.For me, this is much better fun park than universal studios.two thumbs up.

2937,Superb but hot!!!,Legoland is like gasping and gaping every second step..it is so artistically beautiful. The heat makes you gasp as well! Maybe we chose the wrong time of the year to visit. After KL's pleasant weather the scorching heat in Legoland came as a shock. Please do take umbrellas and hand fans with you and smother your kids with sunblock! It was the first time my 7 year old was allowed in a roller coaster so Hurray !!! The lego models in the Miniland are truly mindblowing..i cant find words to describe them. After a full hot day in the theme park we cooled off in the water park. Especially enjoyed the build a raft where u get to build ur own raft from big spongy lego blocks or attach them to a tube! ,4.0
2938,A wonderful experience,"We went to LEGOLAND at the end of July.  The rainy season was great because it would rain and have thunderstorm for 10-15 minutes, then it would stop and be much cooler.  There were not too many crowds at the theme park so the queuing time was 10 minutes max.  The park was plenty big enough for pre-schoolers and tired parents.  There were different parts and the indoor theatres and cafeterias all had AC.  The 4-D Chima movie and STAR WARS exhibits were especially fun for little boys.  There were also outdoor slides and running areas.  The food was surprising decent as well - they had juice, chicken drum sticks, fish & chips, pasta, etc. on offer.",4.0

2940,No more than a one day visit,"We have booked at the LEGOLAND Hotel for 2 nights with a 2 days pass to the park. Frankly we have done all rides in less than 3 hours and kept the waterpark for day 2, which again took us 3 hours and we were done. My youngest one (7 years) was very happy about all attractions, however for my 2 teenage kids and us adults the overall experience was kind of average. If you been to other parks in Malaysia like Sunway Lagoon you will find yourself having nothing to do. Pictures taken of you which are sold on the selected rides are way over priced at the average of 60RM, and I have not seen a single person buying it. If it was at 20RM I would have bought at the every ride. The Lego Technics workshop could have been the exciting place yet the instructor was so boring that my kids asked me to leave after 5 minutes. I am a Star Wars fan and yet another despoilment, short movie and a walk through LEGO displays ‚Äì no interaction, no fun. In my view it is a one day visit to the park, although the LEGOLAND Hotel is very unique and can be considered for a 1 night stay to enhance your Lego experience. On day 3 we contacted a local tour operator and have gone to Singapore :)",3.0
2941,Attractions were mostly closed or work-in-progress,"Been hearing reviews about LEGOLAND, but probably more hype than substance. Visited the theme park with a group of friends - some with young children. I enjoyed the Miniland and Star Wars miniland exhibit as it was fascinating to see LEGO construction up to a very minute detailing. A letdown on a few things:1) Water rides Land of Adventure were closed2) LEGO city stage performance were under constructions (despite having show timings displayed at every board around the park)3) LEGO studios 4D show was cancelled; we were halfway through the animation when the staff announced technical difficulties and were told to leave4) Lost Kingdom Adventure had 2 faulty laser guns on our cart, so it was pretty much a boring ride",3.0
2942,Wonderful resort but the location could be cooler,"I went to to the Legoland Resort with my family with 2 kids - a boy aged 10 and girl 8 years old. The resort is very nicely built with amazing displays made from Lego Blocks. The entire resort was divided into various Lego themes like the Star Wars, Lego City, Lego Tecnic etc. The rides were pretty good and the displays especially in the Star Wars section were just awesome. They had Lego Robotics training sessions too which I also enjoyed. Overall a very nice place for kids and adults too.The only drawbacks were the food options which were very limited for vegetarians and the weather. We probably went in the hottest time of the year and it was far too hot to bear. It would have been so much better if they could have located this resort on a hilltop like Genting.",4.0
2943,A great 2 days!,"We stayed at the Legoland hotel and made the most of the whole experience.

2946,Good experience,"Went to the dry park, and it was a good experience. We went during the weekend, but it wasn't as packed as we'd anticipated. There aren't a lot of rides, but for the price of the ticket it's more than satisfactory. Do go for the wet park as well as I heard from others that it was better than the dry park. Also, it was super hot when we went there, so bring shades and put on lots of sunblock if you so desire.",4.0
2947,Enjoy a lot with daughter,"Had a great time there. Very well maintained facilities as well. It's a heaven for Lego fan. You kids will have fun there. My daughter enjoy all the rides there and she was running here and there, didn't know which one to play first.Oh also star war fan will be happy hereüòÄ there's a Lego full of room.  It's better to get there early. You can get inside 9:30 am. This way at the rides there is less crowd. And mid day, head towards water park and cool down. There's wave pool. Long tube and many more. And after you can go back to Legoland and finish off there. By the way they close at 6:00 pm.",4.0
2948,Good Effort,"Legoland Malaysia was well planned and hopefully still expanding. However, probably due to the tropical weather, I think they should perhaps clean, change, maintain the LEGO bricks around the park as it is not as wonderful as I remember it was 1 year before. Many of the display were either damaged or gone. I hope that the exhibits could be kept in a better condition.Need more adrenaline pumping rides!!!",4.0
2949,What A Treat,"Legoland was a planned visit as it was a promise I made to my kids. It was an excellent experience from the time we entered. The staff at Legoland Malaysia are extremely friendly, informative and helpful.  Special thanks to - Park manager and staff at admission counter who went out of their way to help us change the tickets as our plans were hindered due to thunder storm. The rides were awesome and so were the other activities they had to offer. Legoland is highly recommended to all. ",4.0
2950,Not much attraction,"Not much attraction to play with, so hot at the location, fit for small children, pretty boring for bigger children and adult. there are some restaurants outside Legoland (in-front of), be aware of the kind of ticket you bought, some ticket only allow 1-time entry, so if you get out of Legoland you cannot go back in.",2.0
2951,Short getaway,"We went on Singapore National Day and there was not a lot of people. We finished walking around the park within 3 hours. The rides were mainly for children, not really for adults. I think you will only need max. of 5 hours, we walked around the whole park twice and then went outside of the park for dinner. Is good to take pictures and just have a relaxing day.",3.0
2952,Amazing day for any age,my family and I went here at Christmas and we drove across from Singapore just 45 min in the car. We had a great day and there was plenty to do and see we didnt go into the water area due to time limit. The rides were great and not a long wait. This Legoland is not on the same level as the uk but it was still great . My only negative is its badly set out .,5.0
2953,Loads for fun for all ages,"We bought the annual pass which I believe is of great value because Legoland has enough to do to go back repeatedly. With a one day pass, you only have a single entry to the park and cannot return after leaving, even just to eat at the fast food joints outside. The crowds are nothing like the theme parks in other parts of Asia but the facilities and rides are world class. Even on a rainy day there are plenty to do. Highly recommended!",5.0
2954,Family holiday!,"An interesting place to visit and enjoy the fun for both kids and adults alike.  As an adult, I did enjoy some of the rides.  We went during the local Raya fasting month, and we had the chance to try every single ride.  On a normal day/weekends, you probably get to try only 2-3 rides as there will be long queues of visitors and kids to this place.We spent an entire day in Legoland and returned home feeling excited, looking forward to come here again real soon",4.0
2955,A Whole Day of Ultimate FUN for Families,"This is by 100% a recommended theme park to go to with families of young kids or young adults, or any kind of individual traveler.  Plenty of rides to make hearts glee with fun and scream with excitement.  Park is clean and well maintained.  Staff are friendly and accommodating to speak to about the park attractions.Best to go on a non weekend/public holiday (if possible).  Otherwise, the queue is terrible.Try the 4D theather, the Lost world log rides, the Technic roller coaster, etc.  Worth waiting in line.For lunch, the pizza food centre is highly recommended.  They serve fresh from the oven thin crust pizzas with reasonable price for every tasty pizzas in town.",5.0
2956,Everything is Awesome,"This Hotel is great, experince the world of lego in this hotel, try the theme park or spalsh the water in the Water Park or just chillin' in the hotel",5.0
2957,Great fun for all the family,"We took a taxi from Singapore straight to Legoland, well worth the money - no waiting at immigration and we could spend more time at the park.  At the end of the day we phoned the taxi for pick up.  With three kids (5, 8 & 11) they were just the right ages for the park.  Even the 5yr old was tall enough for the rides with a parent.  No queues so the kids jumped off the ride - ran around and got straight back on again.  They all got their drivers licence - expensive but fun to have.  Rides were great, loved it all but one day was enough.",5.0

2959,Legoland - fun trip for family,"My family of four had a great time at legoland. My elder boy loves the driving school, boat ride, roller coaster etc. My younger boys likes the boat ride.",5.0
2960,Great day out if it isn't raining,"We went at the beginning of August 2015 as a couple with no children. The park has some great features, with life size Lego made adults in different poses. Whilst we were there, there was an unseasonal thunder storm which lasted all afternoon. Lego has a policy of shutting down rides during thunder storms, so the only place to go was the shops. We were disappointed that there were no Asia/Malaysia specific Lego sets.Worth a visit, but be mindful of the ticket cost if you don't book in advance and there is also a separate charge for the car park.",3.0
2961,A FUN DAY WITH MY SON!,"It's been a long hot day yet we really had fun!!! especially my son,he enjoyed taking pictures with a huge Lego on the side of the hotel.It's an outdoor place so better put sunblock first. The food inside is not that expensive,the rides is good for all ages. The staff is really friendly you can easily ask and communicate with them.Goodjob",4.0
2962,A 1 day outing place for family,"If you are looking for a nice day trip out of Singapore for familyThis is a family fun theme park to goRemember to apply more sunblock cream, put on sunglasses and bring along an umbrella cause the place has little sheltering places to rest especially under the hot afternoon sun",5.0
2963,Fun for family and kids!!,"We went to legoland for a day trip. We are unable to book the rooms for legoland as it was full for the long weekend. So no issue we drove from othe hotel to legoland. Something to take note the fast food like KFC Burger King are outside of the legoland entrance and tickets are not allowed re entry..so we have our lunch kfc before entering around 12 plus.. Noon also the water theme park requires another ticket so I think 2 days at least is required to have fun.The legoland is suitable for family with kids and the queue was not long even on a long weekend for sg. My whole family really enjoyed the ""fire rescue"" really exercising for adults and fun and competiting for kids. Do remember to bring a cap sun block lotions as it is really hot for the weather if only going to Legoland. I will be back to try the legoland hotel and water theme park.",5.0
2964,Friendly staff,one hour bus ride from JB Sentral. You should have an umbrella and a paper or battery-driven fan on a sunny day. Outdoor game rides are closed if weather is bad.,4.0
2965,Can't wait to see more trees are grown to keep the place cool...,"We went there about 3 years ago and the Water Park was not ready.  We come back in Aug 2015 and the Water Park is now open for family although we didn't go into it.  We spent time at the Dry Park and have great fun.  The trees have grown and more shrubs and flower beds make the place cooler than before, despite the scorching heat.  More fans have been installed at children's playground as well as the queuing area making it more comfortable queuing up and going around the park.  The rides are maintained quite well and staffs is friendly.  It would be great to come back again, probably 3 years later when the trees are taller and the park is cooler...Like the fact that rides both for kids below 5, over 5 and adults are all present in the park",3.0
2966,Fantastic !!!,"Very nice park with Lego style  , they have water park also , we finale in one day from 10 to 7pm , and I think it's ok to play most of the games .Any one visit Johor or Singapore don't miss that  ",4.0
2967,Great family attraction,"We went towards the end of July, there was very little queue and the whole family had a good time. It was clean, not too hot, plenty of shaded areas to sit and overall staff were good. Food was generally good except for the Shawarma, this was awful, it was more of a challenge than food which ignited a dispute between my father and the inhabitant at the counter serving it.",4.0
2968,2 full days of fun,"We visited LEGOLAND for 2 days recently whilst staying in Singapore. When we booked the hotel we got a very good price on the 2 day unlimited pass. So we decided we would do a day in each park. We did the water park the first day as we could go back to the hotel room to dry off. The water park was great we enjoyed floating around the build a raft stream and the kids loved the playground area. The water slides are amazing especially the ones a whole family can go down together on. In all we spent 5-6 hours there. On the second day we visited the theme park side and spent the whole day there from 10 until 6. It was very quiet (quieter then the waterpark ) which made getting on rides easy and you were able to go again if no one was waiting. The kids loved the log ride, technics rollercoaster and dragon rollercoaster but also enjoyed plenty of others. The mini buildings and starwars areas are very good too.",4.0
2969,A nice place for kids mainly,"We had a day trip to Legoland Malaysia from Singapore a few days ago. If you have kids, you should go to Legoland as they must enjoy it a lot. However, if you are young couples who has an affection for amusement games that can be found in places like Universal Studios, you'd better think twice. The majority of games in Legoland cater for children. The most amusing games are 2 roller coasters called Project X and Dragon. The miniatures in Miniland are surprisingly mersmersing! Luckily, the recent fire only destroyed the KL part. Parts showing the landmarks of other Southeast Asian countries are still well kept. You are suggested to include some air-conditioned games or activities between the outdoor ones as the sun there is really really harsh! One reminder: If you plan to visit Legoland on a day-trip basis from Singapore, don't hesitate to buy bus tickets (or even park tickets) from WTS Travel in Singapore, which offers direct cross-border service from Singapore Flyer daily. Taking local cross-border public buses is time-consuming and it may ruin your trip if there is serious traffic congestion at the border.",4.0
2970,"If you have child below 12, this is the place you should visit","Located in Johor Bahru, just a 60 minutes drive from Singapore (we stayed at Singapore), the ambience and concept is just the same with LEGOLAND California. It's not a really big place, you can ride all the attraction within a day visit.We travelled from Singapore Flyer with WTA travel on 8.30 AM and arrived back to Singapore Flyer on 20.30 PM.",4.0
2971,Great time ,"Had a great day at Legoland.Did a day trip from Singapore arrived at 10:30 left at 6:30 but really think you need two days to do it properly.When we arrived the guy at the entrance recommended the waterpark first ( Legoland is two separate parks beside each other which you need two separate  tickets for ) due to a thunderstorm being predicted for the afternoons that would mean the park would stop operating for safety reasons.The tropical storm hit while at the Lego park side and all the rides were suspended, no way I would have been out there in that lightning and rain.My kids 4/6 loved the water park more than the Lego park , hardly any queues, great staff, safe.Beware,although there are smaller kids water slides,most require the child to be over 1.02 and the bigger rides 1.07 even to ride with an adult.Locker hire is 40rmPlenty of free  to use good quality flotation jackets at the water parkWent on a Thursday, queues were small never had to wait longer than 10 mins.",5.0
2972,Nice theme and water park for family,"We had visited this park for 2 days. We strolled around the theme park during the first day but due to very humid and hot weather, we didnt enjoy it. It is not recommended to stroll around with kids below 2 years old because it's hot. But of course the park cannot do anything with it, best they did is that they have put several sheds around the area. Our second day is more enjoyable since we went for the water park. With 1 kid and a baby, I have decided to rent a cabana so it will be more convenient for my family. But it is pricey and they only have the option of paying for half day only after 2pm. I told them that we will just stay from 11am to 1pm but not allowed to pay for half day rate. It will be better if they will have this option for before 2pm as well (maybe halfday rate for 10am-2pm then another halfday rate for 2pm-6pm). But nevertheless, we will still come back to this park since we have purchased an annual pass =).",4.0
2973,Theme park above expectation,"1) admission fee has 30% discount with maybank card, though i expect more discounts for seniors n children2) rides are fun. I see attendants of rides doing a good job supervising whether kids meet requirements to ride. Saw a foreigner complaint that they need to double triple check but im all for it as they checked my daughter's height. Safety is utmost important3) food is good with good portion n value for money @ Pizza restaurant4) clean washrooms Will visit again!",4.0
2974,Great place to enjoy childhood memories!,Wow wow wow....if only I had a place to visit when I was a child. The Star Wars display was awesome! I had non stop fun from the moment I walked in the gates. The rides cater to adults and children alike. Food and Lego gear was cheap compared to other theme parks. Loved the place and would recommend to anyone to visit.,5.0
2975,Lots of cute spots to look at,"Paid about RM 115 with discount for theme park only. Overall, the experience was good. Every corner you go, you will see a lego figure.. and when you take picture of it, you can hear noises coming from the figure. Loved the tiny ones especially! It took about 3 hours to explore everything. The rides are okay but quite limited. More for children I'd say. All the souvenirs etc are quite pricey, and food wise is quite limited as well. I'd suggest you to have your lunch first before you enter.I was quite unlucky as it rained a bit when I was there. I brought my DSLR but I did not use it. I found using my handphone is more handy, but if you really want good shots of the lego figures, then use DSLR.",4.0
2976,A must do for Lego fans.,"Some tips for families - if you have a child with allergies take your own food, even though they say you can't bring it in. They have signs up saying they can make allergy friendly food but the staff we talked to had never heard of gluten. Beware taxi drivers outside who try to charge you 3 or 4 x the price back to JB. The info desk will call you a taxi or just wave down a red one (not a blue). Take advantage of the indoor air con activities when it's hot, or the water log flume ride (you get very wet, which is lovely). Overall our kids thought it was one of the best days of their lives. They loved it. Would recommend, but I'd suggest sucking it up and paying for the overpriced Legoland hotel then leaving to Singapore. We stayed in JB to save money and wished we hadn't.",4.0
2977,Good Experience To Legoland,"I recently travelled to Legoland Theme Park with my family.  We have spent a day there. My kids enjoyed the theme park very much!We have travelled by WTS Travel's Coach. The experience was good! We arrived at Singapore Flyer to board the bus in the morning. The bus departed on time and the staff were very friendly. This gave me a very good impression of their services.In addition, the Theme Park is very suitable for kids. They have family rides where we are able to accompany our kids to play together. Overall, it was a good experience and good choice made. Will definitely come back again and try out other theme parks too!",4.0
2978,Surprised by how much there was to do!,"We had just one day to visit LEGOLAND Malaysia and got the combo park ticket. We love the pool so we spent most of our time in the water park; great slides, creative lazy river, and more, all with short to no lines. Of course, it rained awhile in the afternoon but there were indoor activities on the theme park side. We could have benefitted from more time at the theme park. I think a family could easily spend two fun, relaxing days between the water park area and the regular LEGOLAND park.",5.0
2979,Nice amusement park,"Clean Park,  clean toilets, a lot of snacks outlet with affordable price. However, the rides are not as many as dufan Jakarta.  I assume this park is still under development. Hopefully there will be more rides next year ",4.0
2980,Very Surprised!  An Excellent Place with No/Very Short Queue,"We stayed in Legoland Hotel and walked to this park at noon on last Thursday.  As it was not a school holiday of nearby Singapore, I was so amazed and happy that no queues EVERYWHERE!  In other theme parks like Disneyland, one cannot take a game without at least 1 hour waiting!We brought my 9 years old niece to the driving school first, which is quite near to the entrance.  He was so excited and was free to line up and took the ride again and again.  When the park was about to close at 6pm, around 5:30pm, my niece went to drive again but at this moment the queue was longer yet absolutely bearable.  The whole driving time is 10 mins and before driving, the kids are put to a room with video for driving lesson first.The park is rather small, yet we had not visited all the places during our 6 hours stay.  The weather was a bit cloudy, so making our visit cozy and more enjoyable.  Finding food and drinks is not a problem in the park.The shop at the entrance has more varieties of Lego products than the small shop inside Legoland Hotel.One suggestion for improvement:  better to have one or two staff in the centre of the boating area to give assistance in case of accident or unexpected event.  Our pedal was malfunctioned and our boat could not move somewhere in the middle of the water.  No one can help. Luckily I could later make good the broken parts by myself.",5.0
2981,good timing to go is the answer to enjoy it :),"Really nice place to go, especially for a lego lover. The lego is much cheaper here and more complete. there are also hard to find lego that u can find here. I went with 2 toddler aged 4 and 6. My 6-year old boy can play almost all the game, but not my 4-year old boy. almost everything inside is child friendly. best for kids from 6-12. We went there on Saturday 25July 2015. it was 2 weeks after the eid mubarak holiday, so it is not too crowded. we can play all the ride even twice since there is no queue. we also stay at the legoland hotel, so we have the privillage to go inside earlier at 9AM while non-hotel guest can enter at 10AM. we also buy the 2-days combo ticket, so the next day after we play at the waterpark, we can go back and enjoy the theme park again for 2days. the weather is so hot but can suddenly rain for a while (at that time). i wore hat and sunglasses but i think it's better to use umbrella instead than a hat. sunglasses and sunblock is a must. there is 1 ride that will make u wet (dino island), so better bring more shirt and pants, or u can use the whole body dryer there with extra charge. Overall, i really enjoy the theme park, the staff very friendly,  toilet quite clean, easy to find restaurant, and the prices are still acceptable. just find the right time to go, coz i think u won't enjoy it if u go at peak season  ",5.0
2982,Second Visit was Worth It!,"Second trip to the LEGOLAND. You can never finish all the rides and attractions within a day! So we have to pick and choose our rides. Surprisingly, there was no crowd on the day we were day, thus we are able to enjoy most of the bigger attractions before the day ends. We tried the restaurant that sells western/italian food. I believe the Pizza set meal was really the most value for money. We will return again, once my boys are bigger.",5.0

But... if you are a thrill seeking individual, you will not find your so terrifying rides here. Also, it is quite hot and humid, thanks to the airconditioned toilet. Don't go during holidays it will double your travel time. Location wise, it was okay. To sum it all up, it was more than average compared to other theme parks. ",3.0

Race your own lego car was fun where it allows you to make your own race car from legos and race them down a ramp with anyone. The simple robotic education was not bad for young kids to build and control their own robot. Food was nothing to shout about and pricey.",3.0
2988,Great Family Holiday,"We travelled to Legoland in May and had a great time.The resort itself is fantastic and themed perfectly for kids to enjoy (and big kids)!The activities on offer are plenty and our kids had a ball just playing in the main Lobby and meeting roaming characters (Emmett, Ninjago).The rooms were clean and large and again themed to please the lego enthusiast.The Park itself was vast and you need at least a day and a half to do a lot of the rides and exhibits, we did it in over a day, however it was reasonably quiet.The Water Park, was a massive hit with our Kids and the staff and Life Guards were so friendly and enthusiastic with the kids and really made our time in the lazy river fun, squirting the kids and playing with them - they had a ball!Cannot recommend more highly.",5.0
2989,One of the best Theme Park,I love this theme park. It has rides for both children and adults. The staff are very polite and courteous. It is not that much people comparing to other theme park.

2994,6yr old's dream,"We visited Legoland for our 6yr old birthday.  He was in Lego heaven!  And already wants to return.Pros:  Attention to Lego detail, range of rides and attractions, 4D lego movies were great to escape the heat.  The build a car amd race it on the track was also very popular. All the staff were friendly and helpful.The Big Lego store was good, but we were expecting to see more Lego merchandise that you cant buy elsewhere.  Everything we bought we could've bought back home.  Also, were were expecting more range of t-shirts and there were no watches, bags etcCons:  If you don't like fast food/pizza etc then you are going to struggle to eat here.  We went on a public holiday which menat the lines were 40mins long which feels like forever for a young child.  Also, we had to stand in the sun and monitor the kids in the lines as other kids kept pushing in front ours.Tip: get a Lego buddy as its hot, humid and there is alot of walking required, Our 4yr old needed to rest along the way and the buggy made it easy.  Bring a hat and sunnies and lots of water!Take a waterproof camera, then you can get great pics at both theme and water park,If you are staying at the hotel, use your early entry wisely and go to the Nissan cars first as these seemed to be the most popular and the lines here were the worst.",5.0
2995,I left my heart in Legoland!,"This place is kind of paradise for all! We arrived exactly at 10 am, took hundreds of pictures of lego-buildings-and-cities, rode the mini-train around the park, had a hearthy lunch at PizzaMania, watched 4D movie about lego, shopped at BigShop and finally left at 4.30 pm. The kids were enjoying each minute they spent there on all rides. The facilities in Legoland are superb! They have clean and very nice smell toilets, friendly staffs, cool mushollas (or surau in Malaysian language). I was sure that I left my heart in Legoland <3",5.0
2996,Great day out for kids and big kids,"We took a tour here from Singapore - the journey was about 1hr 45 total, including getting through immigration, etc. The park is a good size. Not too big you can't get around it in a day but not so small you run out of things to do. The mini cities are amazing and the rides are OK. When we went, it wasn't busy so we didn't have to queue for anything.

3001,Kids and even parents would love it!,"Have been to LegoLand Malaysia twice. Though on both occasions, the visit was bit curtailed. Last time visited on 18th July, 2015 and there was a electricity failure and hence the park came to a standstill. After about 75 minutes with no electricity, the park management decided to give a full refund to all those who were on a single entry ticket. This was commendable on their side.The park contains rides that suits kids with all age groups. Hence unlike Universal Studios Singapore (USS), here the kids will have maximum share of fun & frolic.The park is usually crowded on long weekends (public holidays) and hence while planning, this should be considered. However, the queues are usually under 30 minutes of waiting time and the park is very big so one can always look to start with least crowded rides first.Restaurants are bit limited inside the park. Water can be easily sought within the park but one may find a little expensive so there's no harm if you can manage to carry some with you.The Miniland is worth spending some time and clicking snapshots with some of world's famous monuments built with Lego blocks.Getting to Legoland is easy as buses and cabs can take you there. If you are driving your own car, then massive car park facilities are available.However do note that at least one full day would be required at Legoland theme park and similarly for Lego water park. So trying to cover both places in one single day would definitely shorten the fun!",4.0
3002,Legoland + waterpark = Fabulous fun,"Loads to do for my five year old and we bought a combo pass to do the water park as well. The water park is a sensational break after spending a couple of hours in legoland we dipped straight to the pool! Could almost see the steam coming off us!We stumbled across something which we thought was such an excellent investment - we hired a cabana inside the water park for our exhausted (son and parents actually) to take a nap before returning to legoland again. It was a fantastic thing to do for 180 Ringgits - it came with half day rental - wifi, safe and 2 deck chairs fully reclinable PLUS 12 bottles of cold drinks in the fridge and 2 lego land towels. A great day spent between 2 parks (and a nap in between) - very civilised!",4.0
3003,Nice place,It was a very nice place. Very large with different varieties of entertainment.....The place could have used a better ranges of restaurants.The locker system was very practical and reasonably pricedI will recommend going there for fun ,4.0
3004,"Nice, clean park, best for younger kids","Definitely worth getting the combo pass that includes both the water and amusement parks.  Decent water slides, lazy river, and water structure with various slides, coupd spend half the day here.  A few good rides on the amusement park side, with interesting mini-land structures featuring Asia locations.  Overall the park is smallish, can see about everything in one day.  Several stores for a wide variety of Lego products if you're willing to pay at the higher end cafes you can find okay food, otherwise, suggest bringing your own.",4.0
3005,Legoland adventure,"My family and friend were visiting the place 2nd week of June,2015.We enjoyed the placed but food and stuffs there were to costly.But they have offered too much enjoyment to my family especially to my 2 kids age of toddler and 6 y/o.",5.0
3006,Kids Theme Park,"Our son really enjoy this park more than Universal Studios Singapore, more kids friendly attraction. Weather is very hot when we went there, again I wish theres water drinking tap in some area. Not so fun for teenager and parents, but below <12 must really enjoy this park :)",4.0
3007,Legoland Dissapointing,I was really looking forward to this trio to Legoland - it was the presume highlight of our family holiday. We got he bus from Singapore to Malaysia which took about 2 hours and was ok apart from the queing at the two immigration points both ways! I wouldn't go to Legoland if my kids were any older - they were 7 and 9 and most of the rides were childish and fir much younger children. The star wars models were great and the Lego mini cities were amazing (although very dirty and tired looking).  The food was terrible! It just really missed the mark. It could be an amazing place but it's just not done properly. The shops were ok but the price of Lego wasn't any cheaper which was really disappointing. Quite an expensive long day and it wasn't the magic Lego Mecca we had all been dreaming of.,2.0
3008,Must place to visit for Lego lovers!,"Had such a ball spending a day in this Legoland! Kids loved it and we did as well! It's not so big but it was still so amazing to see the amount of Lego shapes items which has been built there. It was quite annoying at the beginning as it took so long for us to organize our prepaid tickets, we thought it would have been much quicker with the prepaid tickets but we were so wrong! You can get a stamp on your hand to get out of the park and come back in, try doing that because you can have lunch (cheaper) outside then come back in again. The park doesn't have enough shelter, heat and humidity was quite intense, I think they should be building more shelters as it can get quite ridiculous! The miniature world of Lego was just so great! Amazing time there, looking forward to visiting the original one!",5.0
3009,"If you don't have kids , DON'T GO ","We liked there as an experience as there in Johor bahru is not more to see , except the view of the nature there , so we tried enjoying things there , but no ... It's not an adult entertainment , except some small models of Far East countries  being made by Lego in the middle of legoland .  Suitable for kids and families . ",3.0
3010,"Amazing Lego building, details and Star Wars Display","When entering the Legoland attraction at first, I was disappointed.  It seemed more family oriented such as rides on the simulation of a Logo train.  Once I actually entered the display park I was totally blown away.  Most of the displays were oriented around famous Indonesian buildings.  The detail was mind boggling.  Every detail - from plants, to people engaged in activities, traffic patterns and moving parts - was considered.  The Star Wars display which was indoors was magnificent.  If you are a Lego builder or enjoy seeing creative efforts, this is a must to see.The park also has an added feature - a water park.  Good family fun, but expensive for a day pass.",4.0
3011,great waterpark,the theme park is quite entertaining for children as the attractions are mainly built in lego character.  my children loved the waterpark the most. Although the souvenir is not as much selection as Disneyland.,4.0
3012,Not very crowded but very hot..,"I'm come here for two days , one for water park and one for theme park. My kids really love water park rather than theme Park. For theme park, you should see starwars section, very amazing.Both park is very clean although very hot too.",4.0
3013,Fun in the sun for kids and adults!,"My husband, eight-year-old son and I visited the Legoland theme park and water park over two days while staying at the Legoland Hotel (see separate review). We arranged entry tickets before arriving and as we were hotel guests could enter the parks 30 minutes before it was open to the public. We found the parks to be very quiet at first, probably due to Ramadan and visiting on weekdays. All the staff walking around are very friendly and most greet you with a smile.My first recommendation is to hire a locker for the day. They're just inside the main entrance and cost RM20 for the full day or you can hire one for a few hours. You tend to collect photos (and other items) along the way and if you all go on rides it's handy not to carry everything with you.  We visited 'The Big Shop' first as we were planning on purchasing some large Lego sets. The shop was quiet and purchases were made quickly. We arranged for our items to be held for us, to be collected at the end of our visit, which worked well.We followed the map and headed off in a clockwise direction. There are six main areas; Lego Technic, Lego Kingdoms, Imagination, Land of Adventure, Lego City and Miniland. Each area has its own rides, souvenir/Lego shop and eateries. Each Lego shop is different and you may not find the same Lego sets in each of the shops, so check each one along the way. Plus there are roaming photographers and food and drink carts. Bottles of water are quite cheap, so keep some cash handy and stay hydrated along the way.We found it quite hot in the sun, but there are plenty of shady spots, seating and water rides to keep cool. There's also a good amount of indoor air conditioned entertainment if you need to sit and cool down for a while. We enjoyed the Lego Star Wars Miniland, with a fun movie to watch and dioramas representing each of the Star Wars movies to date, and the Lego studios, where there are 4D short movies to view. We watched Clutch Powers but there were other films, including a Chima one.Some of the rides we enjoyed were Technic twister, Aquazone Wave Racers, Merlin's challenge, Observation Tower, Lost Kingdom Adventure (a big favourite), Beetle Bounce, Lego Rescue Academy, Boating school, Driving school (where a Lego drivers licence can be obtained) and take a tour on the Legoland Express train. There are also a few roller coasters for the adults and bigger kids, but we avoided these.The Miniland is pretty amazing, with Lego models of Kuala Lumpur International Airport, the Taj Mahal, pirate ships and so much more!We paced ourselves with plenty of rides, drinks and stops along the way. We entered the park at 9:30am and left at 5:30pm (the park closed at 6pm). An exhausting but very enjoyable day!On the second day we visited the Water Park. You could easily visit all the rides and pools in half a day. We were there from 10:30am to 2:30pm. There was less shade available in this park and you should really reapply sunscreen regularly. Lockers are just inside the front gate (the same ones at the other park) and there are change rooms located there also. We really enjoyed the lazy river which you can float along on a rubber tube. Or you can build your own Lego raft from all the blocks floating in the river! There's also a water playground with some small water slides and lots of water falling from above! A fun structure to climb over. There are longer water slides and really fun ones for the whole family.  We all sat in a round raft and went down the waterslide! Great fun! We did that five times in a row.A large wave pool is located off to one side, about 1.4 metres deep. This was very relaxing with small waves lapping the shore. Photos are also available in this park and there are two fast food eateries. It's better value for money to get some sort of combo meal, but the quality of the food is passable at best so lower your expectations accordingly. And you're not allowed to bring food in from outside.After the heat of the previous day, the Water Park was a good place to keep cool.Both of these parks are great fun for adults and kids alike. They are kept beautifully clean and the staff are happy and friendly. Prepare to spend money, get hot and sweaty and have a great time!",4.0
3014,kids will surely enjoy this place,i kinda regret visiting this place without my kids. i know for sure they will really enjoy it here coz i myself and my man enjoyed every hour we spent here. This is the best place to go if you had enough of disneyland. highly recommended!,5.0
3015,Cleanest CR,"There's always a need to go to the toilet, specially when you're in theme park.  They have the cleanest CR (for a theme park) that i have ever visited.  The staff are always smiling and nice to talk with. You won't get lost for the staff always available to give out directions, etc.",4.0
3016,Good family fun at a bargain price,"It is not as crowded as other similar theme parks, but located quite far from the city center and metered taxi is hard to find, while shuttle bus is not conveniently scheduled",4.0
3017,The full package,"This was a genuine surprise. With two kids of 11 and 12, we were a little worried that this might be aimed a little too young for our kids. Well, we we're wrong. We stayed at the Legoland hotel, which we really highly recommended - paradise for kids! Make sure you get breakfast with your hotel deal - and enjoy the real coffee. The water park was a great three to four hour diversion, and the main park took us the better part of a day. Rides wise, it has it all over the Singapore water park. Better still, whilst Universal Studios was packed with very long lines on the same trip, Legoland was quiet - fancy four goes in a row on the junior rollercoaster (no disembarkation), or three goes in a row on the major roller coaster (with 5 minute waits between each go). At Universal studios we purchased expensive express passes and still waited much longer. A couple of tips - there is an attached mall to the hotel with plenty of selection as far as food goes, all a lot cheaper (of course) than the hotel. And if visiting, make sure you stay at the Legoland hotel, and purchase the two day pass (which allows you to wander in and out as much as you please) - it just makes it easier.",5.0
3018,Great for the kids,"Had a fantastic day trip with the kids (5,8 yrs), travelling in with WTS from Singapore.The bus ride was well organised, takes 30 minutes or so to get through immigration, but was an easy process.Must get access to both the water park and legoland, the kids did struggle with the heat a bit, but a quick dip in the pools and they were on the move again. Moving between the parks is easy, only a 40 metre walk.We didn't get to see all of legoland, could have easily consumed two days and that hotel looked pretty awesome.A couple of minor points to improve;As so many come in from Singapore having the ability to pay for a locker on credit card or Singapore dollar would have simplified the process, had to change currency at shops only after purchasing something, it was a lot of stuffing around :(Also, need more Lego friends stuff to buy, shirts etc, girls love Lego too.But a great day and highly recommended.",5.0
3019,Loved it. Park was so Quiet,Great 2 days trip here. Park was very quiet and did not have to Q for anything the whole of the 2 days! Staff were all friendly and only to pleased to help. Very mannerable also. Park was clean and tidy and it was easy to get about (as it was quiet). Prices for food and drinks were very reasonable compared to somewhere like Disney.I think the water park could be a little better set out for one reason only. The locker area was great to use but we had to walk a few metres to get up to the water. We exited the change area with lockers - and I had new flip flops I was wearing as the ground was hot. I left them at an open storage shelf near the lazy river. I went back for them about 2 hours later and they were gone! My families were still there. I spent 40 minutes looking for them before I found them abandoned a fair distance away and damaged. So someone just chooses any set of sandles and walks away with them when they want basically...But overall I got them back albeit damaged but we enjoyed the park and the staff.,5.0
3020,"Great for kids, age 6-10","We did a 2D/1N trip of Legoland, me, the better half and 3 kids (11, 7, 7). Day 1 we explored the Water Park & day 2, the Theme Park. Both parks are great for small kids. Not much for adults though. The wave pool is downright wimpy (for adults). The slides are much better. One of the slides can be done by a family of 5. I found the theme park more interesting with its monuments and the Star Wars exhibit. Interestingly the kids loved the model car building & spent the most amount of time there.Food is mediocre in both parks, but I was not expecting much. Souvenirs are all Lego and priced accordingly. The park staff is pleasant and helpful. I did not stay at the Legoland hotel - found it overpriced. I got a good deal for two rooms at Hotel Jen, which runs a free shuttle to & fro.The timing of your visit is critical...a crowded park is just not worth it. We went in the latter half of school holidays on Mon/Tue and the crowd was very manageable. I am told that weekends are a crush.",4.0
3021,Legoland last week,its a nicely built place for young kids. My 4year old was very happy and kept repeating the water bomb.Its even better if free WiFi can be provided at the park.The instruction signs on site are not enough and we could not find some of the places drawn on the guide map,3.0
3022,Bad Cashier Service,"We're one of the Annual Passes holder, therefore my kids likes to have the chicken rice at one of their restaurant. But what makes me felt a bit disappointed & terrible was, the way the cashier been treating us with such an irreverent manner that was so called rude when talking to us. This was not the 1st time we've been treated like this. On my previous arrival here, i was attended by the same girl. I couldn't grab the chance to get her name, but her looks is still recognizable to me. And on that 1st incident, i just make my assumption whereby probably this is her way of attending her customers. But sadly, this have been repeatedly on my recently arrival there and this is really pissed me off. And this time i managed to get her name (REEN) - as on her badge. Is this the right way to talk to the customer?? We're paying for our food and it's not for FREE yahhhh!!!!! Don't treat we customers like we're a beggar to u. It would be much delighted to the customers like us if u can show some politeness rather than giving us the cynical looks.I hope the management aware of this inappropriate manner given by the staff.",1.0

3024,Cloudy water,"The park has a lot of nice rides for kids. They loved the water slides and roller coasters.  Unfortunately, the water was cloudy and unappealing, especially in the Lazy River. If the water situation is not rectified, it would impact my decision on whether to visit again.",2.0
3025,For children below 12years old. Family park,"Not for older kids. Better to buy tickets online - more discount when you buy advance. Example 10% for 7days advance ticket, 20% for 14days advance.   Nearest hotel is Leogland Hotel, just 2mins walk. Next nearest hotel is JEN (10mins drive - hotel provides free shuttle bus). Bring some dry clothes, if you like water theme rides. Tip: Legoland is most frequent by Malaysians and Singaporeans. Check out the school holidays period. If you can avoid Malaysia school holidays, you avoid half the crowd. Then waiting time for rides are cut by half!    ",5.0
3026,Good experience,I didn't expecr much and it turned out overall more than good for this trip. I booked the ticket online with second adult ticket at 50% discount so it was fairly worthy. However the queue to the ticket counter was taking too long. The crowd on the day is less so we got to visit the rides multiple times with no lines. All the theme parks were well maintained but the legos on the miniland were too worn out and Dusty! The toilets are Well Kept and deserves A plus. SMOKERS watch out as there were no where u can smoke. Please also bring towel to dry yourselves. I am surprised they said the shades are limited but to me there are quite a number of shady places you can rest. The souvenirs there are Expensive and not much choices but I managed to buy a few. Overall Legoland is worth going.,5.0
3027,Everything is awesome,"Twice in the last 3 months, we have visited Legoland Park avoiding busy periods that coincide with school or public holidays.Perfect to venture here during off-peak periods. Usual waiting time for any attraction or ride is only 5-minutes. This is worthy to mention considering the likes of Disneyland rides do not appeal to me anymore when one queues up longer than the ride itself. Legoland is a much more pleasant experience.Rides are fun abd look very durable and safe. Some rides encourage visitors to do some work by pumping handles to get the police car or fire truck moving at Lego City or pulling on a rope to hoist your sit up a Power Tower in Imagination.Plenty of indoor areas for building Lego like the Star Wars build activity, build and test race cars and even simply playing with bricks while waiting for the Lego Friends show to start at the Lego City aircondituoned theatre.Miniland is fascinating to see where famous sites are replicated in miniature. It was fun to walk around and be amazed by the Lego versions of key Asian landmarks like the Taj Mahal, Angkor Wat, KL'a Twin Towers and lesser known places but just as interesting like Bolinao, Pangasinan in The Philippines.Food around the park is of better quality than what I normally would find in theme parks in Europe.Merchandise in stores are varied but thankfully not as over-the-top as in other theme parks.Duplo Town is a delight for toddlers. 4D MOVIE theatre is worth saving for the rainy spells. Building activities are so therapeutic - everyone in our family loved it. My 3-year old and I particularly enjoyed building our structure as high up without it breaking with the tremors (earthquake test activity). My daughters loved building their own race cars and testing them on the race tracks against other kids' creations.Plenty of things that we have done and we know there are plenty more we can do on our next visit. We hope to maximise our Premium Annual Passes which is good value for money if you at least plan to visit Legoland Park and Water Park twice within a year.",5.0
3028,Kids Love It,"We went in June 2015 and it was our second trip to LEGOLAND. My kids love this place. Luckily we went on a weekday and the Malaysian school holidays hadn't started, so the place was not crowded. The kids could take as many rides on the different attractions as they liked. The water park is also fun for both adults and kids. As the weather is very hot, do bring along sunblock lotion and caps/hats and drinking water. Only complaint from my kids is they cannot get to buy Legos as they are more expensive than Singapore's.",4.0
3029,HOT,"From Singapore, its almost an hour and a half drive in a private car barring traffic at the immigration. First and foremost as a tourist, you MUST have your passport with you and your travel papers so as not to be held at the singapore and malaysia immigration. At the highway in Johor Bahru, there are already signs pointing towards legoland and from afar you could see the colorful building which is the hotel itself. There is a wide parking space provided for visitors. The first thing that greets you upon alighting from the car is the heat of the surrounding... it really is HOT, so be ready with sunscreens to protect the skin and hats or scarves to protect the head. Legoland is really for children and adults that love fairy tales and colors. The striking feature is the colorful buildings one of which is the mini mall and food court rolled into one and the other is multi-colored hotel. The rides and water attractions are well loved by the children too. There is just one catch though... it literally is hot as there are limited shades and sheds. But for me personally...once is enough... there are no other places of interests nearby. hope they continue improving and installing new rides/new attractions so people continue to visit the place.",4.0
3030,Suitable for family with children below 10 years old,"Legoland Malaysia Resort offers total experience of Lego. It is advisable to book into their Legoland Hotel to fully immerse yourself in the experience.

Please check the weather before booking the ticket as the weather in Johor Bahru is unpredictable and if its rain, some of the rides are closed. Best time to go is from May until September when it's the hot season in Malaysia. But be prepared to bring umbrella and wear comfortable cloth as it can get very very hot. Recommended to go to Legoland Park and Waterpark at 2 separated day. Legoland Park might only take half day but going to Waterpark might take whole day because the hot weather in Malaysia compel people to play longer in water ;)",4.0
3031,Nice but hot,"It was my 2nd trip to Legoland. It was better than the first trip (as last time, it was smoky).Not many people around this theme park which made it much more convinient to be around.One thing haven't change was the hot condition. Not much big trees to provide enough shades.But the Star Wars section was quite impressive. Our kids were thrilled and I learned that they were surprisingly know much more than us adults üòÑ",4.0
3032,Ready for a day of family fun?,"It had rained a little on the morning we got there so the place wasn't crowded.  The overcast skies made for a welcome change from the usual hot sunny weather here in Malaysia.  Took the LM1 bus from JB Sentral at a cost of approx. 4MYR per person one way.All the rides were open that day so we pretty much got into the swing of things straightaway.  The roller coasters are well designed and cater for younger children as well, so they are thrilling but not scary.  The new star wars exhibit is really cool to marvel at if you're a star wars/clone wars fan.  Food isn't too bad in terms of taste and pricing.  Previously you could exit and re-enter the park but apparently you can't do that anymore.  Don't miss the ride up to the top of the lego tower which reminds me of a similar tower in a different Malaysian town.  The water log ride is also a thrill and its the only ride in the park whee you are guaranteed to get soaked.  we saw some people buy ponchos to wear for this ride.  Alternatively there are drying stations that cost 10MYR to operate.If the humidity gets to you, you can chill out at the various cafeterias and shops, alternatively you could try your hand at building and racing lego vehicles down a ramp in air-conditioned comfort.The miniland exhibit is also worth a mention.  The buildings, ships and planes are a true replica of their real world counterparts and whoever built them is truly talented.After being here in person I understand why so many people rave about this place.Highly recommended to spend the day here with loved ones and family.To get back to JB, we headed back to the bus stop where we disembarked.  This is also where the taxi stand is and usually there are a few taxies already there waiting for business.  You can take the LM 1 back to JB Sentral at the same cost as previously however the one I took used a different route (coastal road) to get back to Sentral.",5.0

The queues in customs are very long with few immigration officers. And with kids, the experience is worse.The waterpark is okay but not enough shade. The main Legoland is average.

Coming from Singapore the 1 and a half hour journey actually took just over 4 hours, recommend you DON'T go on a weekend day!  I appreciate that the park is aimed at children but I found that even the rides for them were over too quickly making the queuing not worth the wait.  The main attraction was the log flume but again this was over too quickly.  There are plenty of lockers and places to eat and coming from Perth Australia we found it to be reasonably priced for food and drink.",1.0

Particularly fun for elementary school age children, not so much for bigger/older teenagers who want to be thrilled more.Eateries are available in different areas of the theme park, serving different kinds of dishes (pastas/pizzas/rice/fish&chips/etc). Prices of the menu a bit higher than usual (the so-called theme park price), but it is worth it, since they give bigger menu than usual, so it is quite satisfying after all.All in all, enjoyable experience visiting this place.

Lack of excitement on most game, an example : the airport small flight for kid, fly 1 meter height. (Imagine 1 meter from floor, for a flight...)5.

3052,Fun trip for kid,"Before go to Legoland, need to prepare few things like moisturiser, sun block, cap/umbrella. the weather is sun shine means is hot when reach 1pm. there got stroller to rent out to fit weight until 40kgs. we only go for theme park for 1 day as if we go 1 by 1 for each game will just nice for 1 whole day trip. last, need to let kid drink plenty of water..",4.0
3053,Tons of Fun!,"We bought the 2 day Combo (Theme Park & Water Park) and spent two full days at both Theme & Water park. Theme Park was pretty hot. A must go for Star Wars fans, as there were having the Star Wars Lego exhibition. We would probably go back next round for the Water Park as we had fun at the Water Park slides.",5.0
3054,Fantastic Experience - Need more shade though,"We had a great time there though more shade is needed for one to walk around the theme park esp the display area. The heat and humidity is just absolutely mad. One needs to apply and reapply your sunscreen constantly  (kid you not as I fot badly sun burnt!) to be safe. The water theme park was great fun even for a young child. I would say KUDOS to the lifeguards on duty through the time we were here for 2 whole days for being so vigilant all the time and friendly esp to young children. The little playfulness and sprays of water added much laughter to their day. The staff all around are also very friendly, warm and helpful. ",5.0

3056,Legoland Themepark - Fun Place For Entire Family,"First section, the Miniland has 17 iconic places in Asia in miniature form. Really nice to stroll around and look at it one by one.Second section, the Imagination has fun activities for the younger kids and such as the Duplo Playtown, Build & Test and Duplo Express train ride. There is also a 4D theatre with fascinating show to be seen.At the Lego Technic section,  there are rides with slightly higher intensity such as the Project X and Aquazone Wave Racer where children need to be accompanied by adult. More fun rides at the Kingdoms section with roller coasters, carousel and Lego horse saddle competition.I love Land Of Adventure section the most as it consists of exciting laser beam blasting adventure ride, Pharoah Revenge & the water splashing Dino Island ride.I think smaller children under 5 would love this Lego City section as they can drive the small Lego car, climb and crawl the Shipyard, captain a boat, control aeroplane and even help put out fire too.However I do feel a little bit sunburnt as there are little shady areas for the visitors to hide under the burning hot sun.As for the Legoland hotels, you can check out the full review at flyme360.com/share",4.0
3057,Place is fine.,I'm not sure if it is not yet complete but I felt that it's not worth travelling from kl to jb for the legoland. It was so hot there without trees and not much shades. The place also is not that accessible,3.0
3058,Made me feel like a kid again!,"Fantastic place for adults and children alike.  It is a smaller venue but a great mix for the entire family.  From some pretty crazy roller coasters all the way down to a train for toddlers they have something for everyone.  The tour train was really nice to explore and the kids loved it.  I really cant think of a single thing that we ran into that we did not like.  You get a discount on tickets if you stay in the hotel and free admittance into the waterpark as well.  I cant recommend this place enough.  Please do not forget your sunscreen like I did, the sun can be a bit brutal there with overcast skies.  Well worth every penny we spent.",5.0
3059,I've been in my childhood!!!,I really enjoyed it!!! everywhere is Lego characters! great attractions. and Lego bricks are everywhere!!! it is super fun! you wont regret!! and snacks there amazing as well!,5.0
3060,Good - only during off peak periods!,Went with friends during off peak period and it was crazy empty. We did not even bother to alight from the ride because there was no one waiting in queue at all!Can get a little hot during midday so be sure to bring water bottles and sunblock!,4.0

3063,very hot!,"Very hot place. Limited sitting areas. Food is expensive. Entrance fees are not final, you still have to pay for a ride inside the park. Not worth our money. ",3.0
3064,Great fun! ,"We spent 2 days at Legoland and the children enjoyed the water theme park better! The slides were amazing and we conquered almost all the water slides! We went last weekend and it wasn't very crowded so the queue was at most 5 min for each ride. The theme park was alright but due to the super hot weather, the kids didn't really enjoy that much as they felt really tired after a while. Legoland is more suitable for kids 5 years and above. Wouldn't recommend for any kids younger that 5 as most of the rides need a height limit. The kids wanted to go back again! ",4.0
3065,Fun for Kids,"My first impression will be, it is very Hot weather. Not enough tree for shelter. Bring along your umbrella, hat, or you can rent a stroller for your kids. As for the park, it was really fun, lots of attraction, mostly are for kids. There are quite many choices for food, you can see in the map for the menu, each restaurant got different menu. During my visit, it was not that crowded, so can actually visit both park ""Theme Park"" and ""Water Park"" for one day.",4.0
3066,Fun - a few things to improve,"Overall, this is a fun park - going there during Ramadan seemed like the best idea, as it was quite clear that the crowds were very thin. Considering the heat (scorching) and design (no fast track for queues and winding paths for all of them), this was appreciable.The park itself is of unequal quality and staff suffers from the same problem - some were really very nice (like the staff manning the shop in Star Wars) and other dreadfully bored and quite unpleasant (like the guy manning the junior racing school).The medieval area, with a lot of trees is a really nice respite - in contrast City looks worn down and poorly maintained. Similarly in the AquaPark, which has way too many pools with exposes concrete (one of the play areas even had a metal barrier right in the middle of the pool, to protect from a very large piece of exposed concrete)...A few things which were rather annoying:1. The Big Shop is touted as Asia's largest Lego store... this must be in square footage but certainly not in products - you'd expect that instead of t-shirts, they carry all boxes made - not so - for example, if you're looking for Star Wars stuff you have to walk to the shop there. Makes very little sense. The Big Shop should carry the entire range of Lego toys, with another one catering to clothes etc.2. in the AquaPark, towels are not provided for hotel guests - this is rather idiotic since it's easy enough for people to take them from there - also, if you rent a cabana, half day starts at 2pm - so you have to pay for a full day if you only need it for the morning, which we did - very greedy. Each cabana comes with 2 towels by the way... so no need to buy them if you plan on renting one.3. Food is really poor - the hotel's Bricks restaurant is certainly a far better choice than anything in the park - just bad food, poorly made - nobody would expect fine dining but an effort in terms of quality, execution and selection must be possible. Here, it is just badly made sludge in all outlets.Overall and these elements notwithstanding, a good experience - kids obviously loved it and that is the single most important thing... wish the management would try and push the envelop a bit further to keep parents equally pleased.",3.0
3067,Great entertainment place!!,Its an awesome place to enjoy it with kids...best place to them to make their weekend great!! Don't miss the mind blowing architecture...its really enjoyable place for child and adults too!!,5.0
3068,"Fun for all ages, including teens and adults.","Some other reviewers are saying that this park is not good for older kids/adults but I think most of the rides were BETTER for an older audience because most of the rides are roller coasters and little kids will not be able to handle them.The lines were close to non-existent, the Lego statues were mind-blowing and there were plenty of different rides for different people , depending on how much you can handle. It was worth a day spend but the food  was below average.I suggest you go on the rides this way: first go on the Technic coaster, then on the apprentice then on the main Dragon, and then the Dino Island. Most of the other rides can be done in any order; but these rides are the scary(er) ones so this way you are prepared for these ones.Another good thing about Legoland Malaysia is that since there are virtually no crowds you can re-ride and the staff encourage you to re-ride instead of preventing it due to rules concerning queues.Overall, it was great but carry your own food because unless you are used to having terrible Malaysian food that isn't anything like normal Malaysian food, you will dislike it.Didn't go to the hotel though, that's for another time",4.0
3069,Not satisfied,"i've been to others amusement park such as Disney world and Universal Studios, this place is way below those two. It just like cheap amusement park with cheap facility, there's no futuristic rides etc you came to see some statue made of Lego and thats it. They only operate til 6 Pm which is way to early.They also sell Legos at same rate to mall, they should give special treatment to visitor just like In Universal.",3.0
3070,Pretty fun theme park but hot weather,Went there because a short school holidays.parkings lot is inconveniently located far from main entrance and it is open air under hot sun.be ready to walk some distance.if u carry huge luggage make sure a trolley get standby.Inside the theme park got shop for buying souvenir and you can have to staff safekeeping it for you to collect it once you return.bring umbrella and drinking water.the food are expensive. A bottle of softdrink cost rm5.We plan our journey by choosing the park to plan under sun first and when its getting too hot we will go hide inside the aircond park eg.the stage performance and the 4D movie show or starwar lego exhibition. The miniland is fun to take photo and it locate in the center of the park.Worth to try the lego train too.Its a fun experience for family.as many game can be play together.,4.0
3071,Great for Kids,"We went there during June 2015 School Holidays, and it was amazing, our daughter had fun and so do us. it was a family friendly theme park, the games and activities was great, but the only nay for the trip is the food in theme park, its pricey but average quality.. But will definitely come back again. we had a lots of fun.",5.0
3072,it's a heaven for our little lego enthusiast,beware of the weather as most of the attractions are outdoor... it's a half day walk or more to enjoy the whole attraction... be prepared... ,4.0
3073,Travel and day trip from Singapore,"This review will mostly deal with our travel to Legoland from Singapore because that is what I was most nervous about when planning this trip.  Every time I inquired about how to get to Legoland I was given the answer WTS bus service but I really wanted to get there by taxi or private car without paying an arm and leg.  Our hotel could get us a private car but it was $200SD each way.  No thanks!We took the metro from our hotel in Singapore to the Bugis metro exit.  There is a Singapore-Malaysia taxi stand on Queen street.  If you have the Singapore street directory.com app, it is listed on there.  We got there rather early (again because I couldn't find all the info I needed except that some people have 2 hour+ trips just to get to Johor Bahru).  We left our hotel at 7:30 and were in the taxi by 7:50.  We made sure to say $70SD up front and the taxi driver said ""okay,"" we clarified ""okay, as in yes, right?""  The driver did make sure to ask that we had our passports with us.  We also confirmed that he would take us all the way to Legoland and not just the border.Anyways, the ride to the border was only 40 minutes and we were through both sides of immigration and customs in 15 minutes.  Just an observation, but once we crossed the border, our taxi driver took off his seat belt and drove quite a bit faster and between lane lines.  It took another 20 minutes to get to Legoland.  So we were at Legoland an entire hour before it opened.  It seemed too easy for all my fretting.He dropped us off at the Mall of Medini which is located just outside Legoland.  Nothing was open yet (it was only 9 am) so we used the bathrooms, applied sunscreen and ate some snacks we brought with us.  To note, there is a burger king, chicken place, convenience store and some restaurants in the mall.Legoland ticket counter opened at 9:30 so we got our tickets and kept waiting.Before I get into my review of Legoland, I will continue with the travel portion.  Specifically, the return travel.  I asked the driver if there were taxis at park closing time and he said he could take us back to Singapore if we gave him a ""return deposit.""  It was worth the $20SD to us to have a ride home.  We would have given him a tip anyways, but he seemed happy with the $20SD.  We arranged to meet at 6 at the same place he dropped us off.  I took a picture of his license plate so we would recognize the car.We left the park and went to the taxi stand at 6 and he was not there.  We started getting circled by the other cab drivers telling us they could drive us.  They were saying they knew our driver and he would not come back.  A few said it was illegal to cross the border and no taxi can do it (even though we told them that is how we got here).  I won't lie, I was getting nervous.  We told one driver we would talk to him if our driver did not show in 15 minutes.  Well, thankfully, he did show up.  Late, but he was there.  The ride home was not as smooth.  Leaving at 6, we met with some traffic.  But mostly, the border was so crowded.   We waited over an hour just to get through both sides of immigration and customs.  Our driver brought customs forms with him so we were able to fill that out in his car.  He told us that 70,000 motor bikes are known to cross from Singapore to Malaysia at the end of work days.  Even though we were going back to Singapore we still met with very long lines.  We never had to leave the car though to get through customs and immigration.  The kids didn't seem to mind and both fell asleep during the ride.  Another thing to note, they cannot drop you off at your hotel.  They said they must drop you off at the Singapore-Malaysia taxi stand.  Our driver, however, got us another taxi to take us to our hotel.  We had taken Malaysian Ringitts with us and had not spent very much (Legoland takes mastercard) and we asked if we could pay him in Ringitt (with a large tip) just so we wouldn't have to convert back.  And he said no.  Our total travel cost was $140SD.Now Legoland.  We went on a Monday, not during school holidays and it was not crowded at all.  We bought the one day combo ticket.  The longest lines we waited in were for the driving and boat school.  But even those lines were only 10 minutes long.  We were able to ride most rides multiple times.  When we got hot, we ate at the market restaurant or went to the 4D movie.  The market restaurant was priced like most theme parks, slightly higher than average (we got two chicken nugget kids meals and fish and chips).  The miniland was so cool and well done.  The jousting ride was very popular with my kids and we had to eventually put a limit on how many times they could ride so we could try other rides (I think they rode it 8 times).  They have signs that they recommend water park in the morning due to possible storms but we went to the main Legoland first and spent from 10-3 enjoying the park.  At 3 pm, we got a locker and changed and stayed in the waterpark until it was time to leave.  I wish we had more time at both but we were able to ride everything in both parks.  We just had such a good time, we could have done a second day or spent more time at the water park.   We didn't spend alot of time in the lego building centers so if we had a second day we would have done more of that.We did Universal on this vacation too, and Legoland actually seemed to offer more rides (not as large in scale).  I think they were aimed towards a younger demographic also.  A highlight of our trip for my 4 and 6 year old",5.0
3074,From singapore to legoland,"Intook a day trip from singapore to legoland,there is a old fashioned park in Malaysia,the rides are good for kids3-4 ,but for older are boring.The water park slides need maintenance,you could stuck easily on the way down,and is not slippery enought to pish u down.Totally Singapore has the same and much much better parks,so for only visiting some legos is not worth travelling to Malaysia.",1.0
3075,Good theme park for small children,"The park is not very big but is enough for young children to have fun. The rides are all for small children so adults won't have much fun. The best time for children to have fun there is when they are 100 cm tall as that is the minimum height for most rides. Please bring umbrella and handheld fan as the weather there is super hot and bring a lot of water if u want to save money buying water there. Children has a lot of chance to play lego there and they can bring the lego around but u have to give it back when u exit the park. Bring extra clothes as there is 1 ride that will make u wet. Overall the park is fun for kids. U can rent a stroller there, single seater or double seater. They sell a huge range of legos there with some limited editions available there",4.0
3076,Water park and theme park!,"Awesome rides and queues were not long.Nice short getaway for families with kids.managed to cover most of the rides in half a day at the theme park. Not much queue except for the kids driving school. Many water rides at the water park too, so it‚Äôs a great place for a short family getaway.

3083,A good day out for kids,"Arrived early on a Sunday morning to try & beat the queues, expecting a long wait for the few roller coasters that are there. The entrance fee is reasonable for the size of the attraction & did not feel it was too expensive. We did not go to the water park so cant comment on the facilities / amenities thereAs others have said there is a definite lack of shade, which for a park aimed at kids is a pity, plenty of factor 30 sun cream required. The next surprise was how quite the whole place was. Even at the busiest time we were still able to stay on the rides without having to get off run around and queue again. Don‚Äôt understand why it was so quite on a  weekend, but a definite bonus.Plenty of food and beverage places, offering typical food, it‚Äôs not 5star food, but then I would not expect it to be, burgers n chips, chicken n chips and it‚Äôs not over priced. My daughter is 9 and had a great time exploring, never got bored and spent the whole day there so must be doing something right.Plenty of washrooms & toilet facilities and all were kept clean and tidy. In fact the whole park was clean with no litter anywhere, this surprised me because apart from Singapore, everwhere else I‚Äôve been the litter is just dropped on the floorThe only negatives about this place are the price for photographs on the rides at 60MYR, my daughter picked  a ride photo in the shape of lego, but when they asked for over 200MYR it went back, can‚Äôt justify paying that for a photo. The negative that bothered me most though was having to pay for car parking, yes its only 10MYR, but there is nothing else around here so it‚Äôs not like you can park your car & wonder around shops all day and not spend any money in Legoland. You have to pay to enter Legoland so for me car parking should be free. Just get the feeling that management decided let‚Äôs make the most out of the customers and someone came up with the idea, car parking charges.Overall though was a very good experience, probably aided by the fact that the park was quite & we could go on the rides multiple times.",4.0

3088,Great fun for kids,"This is our 4th visit to Legoland. It is also our first visit to the waterplay park.Waterplay park is great fun, though the usual elements were present: wave pool, lazy river, kids, and slides. The lazy river was different cause they provided styrofoam  lego bricks and lots of people were quite creative. The wave pool was disappointing cause it was too mild. The slides were great fun though. The lifeguards were good. They made their presence felt and played with the kids.The theme park was good. However, for people who want thrills, this is not the place. ",5.0
3089,Impressive & Wow!,"I was very impressed with Legoland Theme Park. Didn't make it for the water park though. The time of my visit, it was a cloudy day but nevertheless, it didn't stop me from having a good time/day at Legoland. In fact, cloudy was good because the weather was cooling to walk. On some rides, you will get wet, so make sure you wear something comfortable (perhaps an appropriate short pants). Bring along some small towel to dry yourself if you're not willing to pay RM10 for the Body Dryer machine (like me!). Used up so many tissue packs! Lol! Preferably don't wear jeans, as it will take longer time to dry off unless you're okay with that. Other alternative, you can buy their Lego poncho which I finally realized why they are selling it. Hehehe! :D  If you're going with just your significant other and it's only two of you, bring along a camera tripod or a selfie stick as there are a lot of attractions which you would want to take pictures of. Or if you don't mind, you can ask others to help you snap picture which was what I did. Fortunately, the people were friendly and some staffs are also helpful and willing to help you out. Toilets are clean and dry all the time (which is very important to me!). The parks are also well-maintained despite you can see some signs of wear and tear but what you expect in our tropical climate? If you're planning to visit the theme park, do allocate a whole-day trip on this, not just a few hours. It's better to enjoy yourself than to rush. I took the theme park leaflet at the entrance, and that leaflet is very useful to help you navigate around the park. In fact, it was very informative as well, you hardly need to ask the park ranger much.  As for their souvenirs, don't expect much as you can also get it in normal Lego shops in shopping malls. In a nutshell, it was a good trip to Legoland. Might try out the water park in future. :)I bought my tickets online. On certain period, Legoland website does have some good deals and you may save a lot from their original price/package. So do watch out for their promotions. Of course, you may definitely purchase the tickets at Legoland itself; there are many counters there, you won't need to line up for long.Parking fee is RM10 per entry, which I think it's quite worth it, looking at the fact that I was there almost the whole day. Very convenient too, as I paid using Touch and Go card. Except the parking zone at 1 and 2, the roads are quite bumpy and alot of small, tiny rocks. But it is a spacious kind of parking lot! You do need to walk a distance though, from where you park, up to the Legoland entrance/ticket counter.",5.0
3090,Fun for Young Kids,"Not so fun for adults. Prepare for the heat, wear sunscreen, and stay hydrated. Check the showtimes and schedule accordingly for a nice break in the A/C. Most rides have a minimum height (+95 cm) & age requirement (+4yrs old) yet children above 3 years old require to purchase entry ticket.If you plan a return visit, it might be worthwhile to get the annual pass which will give free parking and discount at retail / f&b.",4.0
3091,Graduated from Legoland!,Better for under 8s.  Celebrated my son's 7th birthday at Legoland and he's officially graduated from the rides now - he has tried them all and 'conquered' them.  Legoland is very good for U8s but does get boring for the older kids.,4.0
3092,PERFECT during Non-School Holiday,"Wow ... My kids love and prefer this than Disney World in Orlando, FL of USA. Can you believe it? Well, at least this is for Lego Enthusiasts. A few things that went right:1) Please visit when Malaysia/Singapore schools are in session. When we visited on May 27, there was absolutely no one around. The Dragon ride and a few others were so empty that after the 1st round was completed, the operators suggest ""2nd round?"", and if everyone clap hand, you go immediately for round 2 ride! Ha! And after round 2, everyone left, and yet, I do not even see any new incoming rider waiting! I just hope Legoland would not close in a couple years. :)2) Imagination park, which is located towards the end, is a big attraction due to (i) 4D theater showing every 30 minutes rotating through 4 shows, (ii) Build your lego car and race on the track  (iii) Large & Covered kids playground with small train ride.  3) Best place for food is the King's Grill. RM$68 for 2 adults 2 kids combo meal. You can sit right by the window, and watch/feel the roar of Dragon Ride roaming by! Fun.A couple things that can be improved on:1)  The Water Splash ride did not provide any coat cover, and we have to pay exorbitant fee of RM$13 for 1 cheap rain-coat. In Disney, they used to provide the re-usable for free. If participant is gonna get FULLY WET, please gives warning to customers at the time of booking. I have 2 kids, and since the ride must have adult accompanied, I have to buy a minimum of 3. So we skip this.2) The water park's water is colder than I expected, especially at the big central structure where the bucket of water came splashing down.  3) There are many sharp edges in the pool's ground, due to the patches or broken patches. 	4) The Lego City showing famous building, that park can be replaced. I see no one there. 5) The photo is way too expensive, RM$60/sheet! Please learn from Disney -- USD$150 for unlimited photos, including professional shoot + ride's photo for the whole family, all in downloadable electronic copies. Overall, the park is real small compared to other world famous theme parks. Feels like your backyard playground. Nevertheless, it was great fun and memory for the kids.",5.0
3093,Excellent... Kids loved it...,"my boys enjoyed it so much that I had to take the annual pass to visit Legoland frequently! the rides were fantastic... one thing to improve, the 100cm restriction they kept - appears to be deviating at various ride points. Meaning, my son, was qualifying at some ""100cm"" limits but not at some ""100cm"" limits.. strange but true...",4.0
3094,Heaven for Kids,"I came here as Brand New Theme Park which very famous talking by people.Traveled from Singapore by bus, it took almost 3 hours. I reached here around 12 p.m.Fist impression which I get is uniqueness. The giant gate made by Lego. The have lots of ticket counter so you no need to queening for long.This place is perfect for kids, due to most of the games are for kids. They also provide souvenir shops, restaurant, mushola. You also can enjoy the 4D Cinema where you can watch short Lego Movie with different experience. They also have miniature of some Landmark from some countries, such as KLCC Petronas Twin Towers, Taj Mahal - Agra India, Wat Arun - Thailand, etc.",4.0
3095,Great weekend getaway from Singapore,"I travelled to Legoland from Singapore, with my wife and four year old son, during March 2015. It was a three day weekend on account of Good Friday and we made a last minute decision to visit Legoland. To our disappointment, we realised that all the rooms in Legoland hotel were fully booked. We were not too keen on staying in any other hotel in Johor, and so decided to convert our tour to a day-trip instead.On Friday, we started from our home in Singapore at 10AM. I was using Google Maps, and had keyed in the destination as Legoland Johor. Few minutes on the road I realized that Google Maps was directing me towards Woodlands checkpoint. I decided not to change course and to continue with Google Maps recommendation, something that I feel in hindsight was a wrong move. We reached Woodlands checkpoint at 10:25AM, and it took us a full two and half hours to clear both the Singapore and Malaysian Immigration. The whole infrastructure seemed pretty unprepared for the high amount of weekend traffic. I believe the Tuas checkpoint is more modern in infrastructure and hence better placed to handle high traffic on weekends.The next topic of confusion was exchanging to Malaysian Ringgit and procuring an AutoPass card. I was pretty surprised to see that there were no money changing facilities available in the checkpoint. So next time I have to make sure I carry enough Malaysian Ringgit with me and not wait to convert my Singapore Dollars there. Also, there were no counters selling AutoPass cards. You can buy them once you enter Malaysia in many petrol pumps. But still, AutoPass cards are not as easily available as eZ link cards are in Singapore.  Having spent two and a half hours in navigating all the above mentioned problems, we emerged on the other side of Woodlands checkpoint in Malaysia. From there, it was a pretty straightforward thirty minutes‚Äô drive to Legoland. There was some confusion created by Google Maps when it directed us to a wrong exit. We had to spend extra ten minutes to come back to the expressway and then we decided to follow the road signs instead of Google Maps. Upon reaching Legoland, things went better for us. We had already purchased tickets online, and entering the park was a breeze. I was hoping to see some weekend crowds, but the park pretty much seemed to be able to handle the weekend surge. For example, we never had to wait a long time for any of the rides. There are locker facilities available near the entrance where we conveniently deposited our bags. We also had enough food options for us, given that we are vegetarians. The rides are well conceived and managed, and can interest both young ones and adults alike. We spent three hours going around the park, and did not realise how fast the time flew by. I had purchased a combo ticket, for the theme park and the water park. As per my experience, a family can easily spend five to six hours to cover the whole theme park at leisure. The water park may take another three to four hours if you want to try out all the rides. Overall, I felt that a good plan would be to visit Legoland for two days. On day one, one can see the theme park and then spend the night in the Legoland hotel. On day two, one can see the water park. This would give adequate time to cover the whole Legoland, as well as enough time for relaxation. Do also please note that the theme park is open from 10AM till 7PM, while the water park is open from 10AM till 6PM. The water park may also be closed if there are any thunderstorms. Having spent five hours in the park, it was time for us to call it a day. We had not been able to cover a lot of the park, but that was something noted for correction in the next time. We enjoyed a simple dinner in one of the many eateries outside the park entrance. On the drive back, I decided to go via the Tuas checkpoint. The journey back to Singapore was a breeze. I took exactly 70 minutes from Legoland to my home in East Singapore. I and my family really enjoyed the time in Legoland and hope to visit again with better planning and preparation.",4.0
3096,A paradise for Lego Fans,"Located right beside Legoland, it was perfect for the kids to spend the night without traveling too far. We stayed in the pirate themed room which had a little quiz for the kids with a prize if they managed to solve the puzzles. The children were absolutely delighted with the hotel and can't wait to return again. But it's a pricey hotel and you can only check in at 4pm. Breakfast was good but very crowded. Staff were friendly and helpful and it's truly a place just for Lego fans.",4.0
3097,Okay to an extent,"Everything there was awesome and super creative. They tried their best to link almost anything to lego, and you can see their efforts. The structures and decorations are very impressive, most of which are made out of lego, and you cannot help but take as many photos as you can, even if you are the kind who knows that you are just going to delete them later. The rides were quite okay, but most of which are pretty kiddy. Especially in lego city where most of the rides caters towards kids. The more thrill seeking ones I would give them a 3.5/5. Again, this theme park are mostly targeted towards kids, so the pace is quite easy to catch up with. If you want to know what the rating of 5 roller coaster thrill means, I suggest you go to Australia. The rides there literally make you throw up. It is not impossible to finish all the rides in one day, but it mostly depends on the weather and queue. When we went during the final days of the march holidays the queue was mindblowingly short, we could take each ride at least twice. But if the weather hates you plan out the rides which are your first priority. If you are an adult or teenager, avoid kiddy rides like the teacups or driving and boating schools (they don't allow you entrance if you are above 13 anyway.) If you are with kids this is something they would enjoy because there is a slow pace plus a fun way to test their motor skills. Here's a bonus: don't go to the 4d show. It totally sucks. The chairs don't even move, the effects are extremely lame (water and smoke, really?) and the movie they show along with it is just awful. The character are annoying and you just sit there praying that it's gonna be over soon. One last thing: eat lunch outside the theme park. There are restaurants like secret recipe, Burger King and kfc just right outside the entrance. The food inside the park is 1)overly expensive 2)very, very bad. ",4.0
3098,Good,"3rd visit to the park, 2nd visit to the waterpark. It was Friday when we went to waterpark and quite crowded. They have new zones as compared to last year and kids enjoyed. Will recommend the build a raft river, wave pool, duplo splash safari. Joker soaker is super crowded so though is fun, not suitable for smaller kids who may get pushed or run away (hard to supervise). Price is expensive, as one is unlikely to play too long in the waterpark usually.  We went to legoland themepark on Sunday (another day) but its not crowded. Rides waiting time is good except the boat ride which is quite popular. New attraction at starwars zone which is a must visit, as they have extensive exhibition and good show. Missed the new lego friends show as kids wanted to take the big train instead. Went for the same rides but include some new rides this round. Most enjoyed - boat ride, junior driving school, big train, small toot toot train, miniland, starwars.It was raining on and off on both days so was not hot but quite chilly at times. Hope there will be more promo and cheaper price. Service staff generally are good, polite and will help if asked.",4.0
3099,Two parks into one. 3 year old to 13 year old all had fun. ,"There is so much to do here that one should really spend two days. If you are spending one day here, then please do the water park first.¬†Go to water park first. Reasons :1. Water park closes earlier so you will get more fun if you do it first¬†2. Toilets to bathe are much cleaner and will get grotty during the day. And too much hair and clogged sinks at the end of the day.¬†3. Mad rush for toilets when everyone has to get out at the end of the day4. Hopefully Counter-intuitive to the flow of most people so hopefully less crowded.¬†Rating on water park¬†1. Plenty of rides - has something for everyone from babies to older people.¬†2. Baby pool is warmer. A lot of the other places is colder - perfect if it is a hot day.¬†3. Lots of life guards so feel safe with young children and they also make sure everyone behaves and cleanliness of place is kept.¬†4. Water pressure weak in the toilets¬†Other water park tips:1. They charge for everything so bring a small carry-on luggage and bring your own towels. The big locker can put in a small carry-on. RM 20 (eg handbag) for small locker. Rm 40 for large locker. Rm 10 per towel. Go do the Maths.¬†2. Lockers are great facilities wise because you can open it many times. But entrance to water park and adventure park different so if you bring a carry on will have to bring it back to car halfway during day or else have to rent another locker at adventure park.¬†3. If breaking the day into two, can have lunch outside at the Medina because there are more food choices.¬†4. We came once a sunny weekday and another time on an overcast weekend and faced a lot less lines. Weather was also so much conducive for having fun. If you are in water, a little rain doesn't hurt, so that should be the day you come.¬†ADVENTURE PARK. Come here for rides, giant playground, group games eg in a fire-fighting Lego engine, a show with 5 dancing girls, seeing Lego characters and also famous sites made of Lego. Service staff are also very relax and friendly.¬†Tips on Adventure park¬†1. The park isn't that crowded so very few lines. But For those rides with lines in the adventure park, they do seem to move very slowly especially for the driving school. But the rides are probably longer. However on the day we came, by 5pm all the rides seemed to be empty and we had loads of fun.¬†2. Below 120cm and 3 years old there are some things that are not suitable. So may wish to come only if kids are older. Having said that my 3 year old had no problems finding lots to do and really liked the Star Wars exhibition and the mini-legoland and there were so many different theme playgrounds and some rides eg boating school and aeroplane. Just as my 13 year old nephew loved the rollar coasters.¬†3. The performance is 5 girls dancing and audience getting involved. It's suited for younger children and girls.¬†4. In interest of time may wish to plot out where to go on the map before going. The map names rally do not indicate what the rides are all about.¬†",5.0
3100,star wars exhibition worth the visit,go visit the newly opened star wars exhibition. you can see all the epic battles from episode 1 to 7. Place is not too crowded...can finish in a day with proper planning.,4.0
3101,Kids love to go there,We were impressed with the park as it is rather big and with lot of things to explore. Kids really love to go there and spend the entire day in every corner in the park. We like the miniature constructions of some of famous attractions in different countries. The only things that we felt exhausted was the hot sun. It was really hot inside the park so please bring along with umbrella to avoid sunburn. In fact there is a room with air-cond where you can temporary enjoy the cold air. It was so much fun inside the park and it is worth the money we paid for. We'll definitely going back in the near future.,4.0
3102,OVERPRICED OVER RATED,"Coming from Singapore on a booked bus $A25 return, this 90 minute trip to LEGOLAND was made much easier, getting through customs etc.  Whilst I would highly recommend going on a weekday, fewer crowds and locals, singaporians and Malaysians.  I found entry to be very overpriced at $A74 for adult and older children.   This is a small park (about same size as Universal Singapore), and fortunately the rain (never seen anything like it, drowned in seconds) didn't come down till 4pm.   LEGOLAND does not close or refund due to this common downpours.   Staff were very interactive, within themselves... there seemed to be little interaction with park Lego store within has very minimal stock and variety, (seen more variety at Target) and it was slightly more in cost to buy than Australia (when not on special).   Many souvenirs' were only 'Legoland' and no specific reference to Malaysia (I think the same souvenirs are used world wide and not country specific (therefore cheaper to produce.    There is a small mall outside LEGOLAND, not much there, and of course LEGOLAND hotel.   I found the hotel to be overpriced and unnecessary for the visit.   I haven't been to LEGOLAND Florida to compare but I would suspect it would be a more joyful and engaging place, being everything in US is Big !  and the US has much more theme park competition.   A note, the toilets were very below standard (especially for a theme park) the womens smelt like a urinal (without exaggeration) and there were big old machines going to try filter the smell out, to no avail. Very poor.",1.0
3103,Lovely theme park and lots of fun for the kids to enjoy their time.,It was a fantastic place to take kids there where they can enjoy themselves for the whole day . Actually you need two days there as one day you spend the whole time at the water theme park where they can swim and do the splash pool and others things while the other ones are more for the rides. Which the older kids love. So take your own food and plenty of water as it is very humid and hot.,5.0
3104,Fun huge land,"We had a fun visit. Area was huge. Loved the rides where parents and children can participate together. Lego mini land was surprisingly impressive. Toilets were clean. Only downside is food, entrance tickets, souvenirs and photos were all pricey.To me, RM60 for a candid shot is on the high side even for a tourist location. If only they could bring down prices of these items, I'm sure mummies & daddies would not think twice to get those souvenirs / photos etc for their kiddos to complete the memorable experience.",4.0

We were told to do the Water Park first as the crowds would get there later on. Its was a kids delight...water water everywhere and no one to prevent you from jumping in. There were slides and water shooters, and much more. Next we went to the rides, adventureland, miniland, lego kingdom  and ofcourse the shows. Everything was excellent and even adults could enjoy LEGOLAND ...Try and find a hotel close by  so that when the area closes down at 7 pm you do not have far to travel.",5.0
3109,Such a great theme park!!,"The Legoland theme park is great! It is located about 3 hours from KL and an hour from Singapore (excluding time getting through customs) so it is quicker to get there from Singapore if you are staying there. The park was quite deserted which made it better for us! We got a duo pass to cover us for the water park as well as the other amusement park. We had a great time, the friendliest staff and a great experience. The workers there really made the experience great for us. Great for little kids and big kids such as myself as well! It was great!! Wish it was closer to home so I could go back. Well worth the trip!!",5.0
3110,It was good but slightly bad,"Everything was ok except for my mistake.I booked the legoland amusment park tikets (including water park)with wrong date which I totally did not know until the day I visted. so I tried to negociate with manager to  change my tickets with no extra charges but I cant. That was my mistake but I thought I can get date change service cause I did not use them at all and just one day difference. BUT they said NO~~~ I bought them again with full charges. :(Anyway except for it, it was nice experience for my 5yrs boy. ",4.0
3111,Too short of time to enjoy,"Lobby was not grand but very friendly to kids. There are a lot of play areas for kids while adult can wait for their turn do their check-in. The hotel is next to Legoland which is easy access. The lifts which are all of different themes. The disco lights in the lifts do make people felt dizzy though to my opinion. It is a must to experience the water park. About the hotel, the allowable check-in time is 4pm and check-out time is next morning 10am which is not good at all. We get to enjoy the room and facility very much lesser. Not good, not good.",4.0
3112,fun-filled place for family with kids,especially like the water park and slides as it is well built and safe for kids. the colourful theme park is eye-catching. most recommended for family with kids above 4 years old. the hotel room is splendid with impressive interior. just that not much choices for food at night,4.0
3113,Rides good for all ages,Rides are good for all ages. Food prices have increased though and not much promotion going on this time around. Need more shade around the park. Very hot weather,4.0
3114,Fun park for the young one!,"We went there last weekend (6-7th) but the park wasn't really crowded hence we didn't have to queue for a very long time for most of the games. However it did rain on both days so it ruined a bit of our experience. In my opinion most of the rides are for young children and there really aren't much for the adults. However the newly opened star wars miniland is very nice though, if you were a star wars fan, you definitely don't want to miss this.Visitor who bought 1 day pass for one park only need to be aware that there is no re-entrance to the park. If you arrived in the morning that means you are forced to eat inside the park. I only tried 2 restaurants inside but I can say the foods were very bad and too expensive.  Shops are boring too, every shops seem to have mostly the same merchandise. So all the shops located through-out the park seem redundant.The locker at the waterpark cost RM 20 for small one and RM 40 for big one. There aren't any free towels provided so if you need them you have to rent one for RM20. There are cabana for rental too but I can't remember the price.Overall it is still a fun park for the kid however as an adult I found it less attractive.",4.0
3115,Must see park for Lego fanatics,"Legoland Park was a must visit in our last Sg trip, located just 11/2hours away Sg.

The hotel was also true to the Lego theme. I love that they a separate room for some adult privacy and own wash basin for the kiddos.

3117,"Great fun for all of the family, especially outside school holidays for Malaysians and Singapore, there were no queues!","We were extremely lucky with the timing of our trip; no school holidays for Malaysia or Singapore, the 2 key markets. There were thus NO queues at any of the attractions and staff were delighted to see us and have something to do! The Driving school was both educational and fun, especially when you stay at the hotel and get in at 9.30. We were the first and only guests for many rides on the roller coasters and Dino Island. The latter ride was great fun, even if you did get very wet! Our son tried out virtually every ride and enjoyed them all. We all enjoyed the 4D films, managing to see 3 different ones. The afternoon ""Friends"" show was also fun with our son going on stage to play the drums, winning a small prize. There was a variety of food outlets and it was easy for us to find non meat food. The food was very reasonably priced, compared to other Theme Parks, especially the ""Family Combos"". There is a very large Lego shop with many tempting products. It is about 20/ cheaper than Lego here in Thailand.  The Water Park had a great variety of rides to suit all ages and water skills.  The water slides / bucket area was very well supervised by staff who genuinely like children and this enabled the parents to watch from the sidelines. The Legoland replica buildings was interesting to look at. We have visited all of the Asian countries featured in the display. As the Theme Park attracts guests from many different countries, would it be better to have famous mini buildings from Europe - the home of Lego- rather than from Johor Baru, none of which are ""world famous""?",5.0
3118,Disappointed - Water stoppage means Park closure,"It happened like this.On 4 April 2015, Saturday of the Easter Weekend, we visited the water park of the Legoland in the morning.  We took a bus from Singapore, and arrived right outside the Legoland.We followed the advice from here and from the ticketing staff - that it is better to do the water park first in the morning and then the park itself in the afternoon.The park wasn't busy that day, and we almost finished everything at the water park around 12 or so. But before we left, we saw people starting to leave the water, and some staff also asked people to go back to the changing room.  No announcement, and we thought probably there would be thunderstorm or lighting.When we were about to leave the changing room, we asked the staff for locker arrangement as we originally planned to leave the bags in the water park.  Staff said no, we couldn't leave anything in the locker, upon further questions, he told us to bring the bags and leave, and perhaps try to find some lockers in the main Park.  NO  REASON whatsoever was offered despite I asked why we had to leave the water.So we went out and then found a lot of people lining up at the ticket counters.  Then I asked staff over there about the lockers, and at that point of time, I was told the whole park, both the water park and the main one, had to be closed because there was no water.  They had to close the main part because toilets also need water, and no water meant we couldn't use the toilets and the Park so had to be closed.  We then lined up for ticket refund.  We could either choose a refund or another ticket for use on another day.  But the refund option was not so clear so I asked the manager who finally came out to make announcement through a microphone.After about 50 minutes or so of lining up, when it was almost my turn, the gate suddenly opened.  There was no public announcement whatsoever, and I asked the staff there, and they said the Park was open again, and we could visit it.  Great !About our bags again.  We paid for whole day use of the locker at the waterpark, and after enquiring with several staff, we finally got a free locker in the main Park again after it opened.  No need to be penalised for Legoland's closure.Legoland should really improve its water supply and the way it deals with contingency.  Staff training would also need to be boost up. Despite all of these happenings, we managed almost to finish everything in Legoland and watched the show.  The whole area is not that big, and I am sure that those with kids could also do it within a day with better planning.  Sun and heat, however, could be a problem and it might limit the activities that you want to do in one day if you want to really enjoy it.   Legoland is more for kids below 10 for sure.",3.0
3119,"Too hot, too pricey and not enough entertainment","You want to awed in a make-believe world... I was not awed at all.. Maybe it's the unpredictable weather of super strong sun followed by thunderstorms. But I give it 0 for ""wow"" factor. Besides some of the rides that are worth queuing up there, some are washouts. The only thing I liked was the ""build your own vehicle"" technique station suitable for 6 years and above. The giant kiddy playground next to it is badly maintained with flacky paint and rusty slide handles. Unsafe for little ones. The food is as theme park food goes - overpriced and microwaved... You eat there because there is no where else to eat and no where else to hide from the sun or rain. There are little entertainment between exhibits besides large Lego statues. The ""largest Lego store"" in Asia should make full use of its size, display, stock up and sell more classic and unique Lego sets.",3.0

This is the place to be if your children are under 10. We will be there when the park opens at 10am and leave when they closes at 7pm. We may still come back if the kids request strongly or we get good discount for the annual passes. For now, we will keep the perfect memories we had in our mind for a very long time.

3128,Great for Kids,"It's all really great for kids, and a bit fun for adults too! The miniature displays at the middle of the park really caught my attention and interest, I just couldn't put my camera down and just want to capture every little detail of the displays! It's also nice that they displayed a place in the Philippines, Bolinao. It is also nice that these displays are interactive, like the merlion that can eventually make you wet if you press the button. My Cons though are:-- It is a really open theme park. It gets too hot during day time when the sun is out and you'll get all wet when it rains. Unfortunately we get to experience both happenings. -- Everything inside the theme park is expensive. Food, mini games, souveniers and toys are all over the top expensive.-- I hope they allow people to come in, out and then in again in the park. They have this policy that once you go out, you cannot come back in. I guess stamps are not really a fad in LegoLand. :)Other than that, it was once hell of an experience there. One tip as well, if you don't want to be all too stressed with the experience, do not try the firemen thing. Haha. :)",4.0

3130,FUN FUN FUN in the sun!,"We had an absolute blast at LEGOLAND Malaysia. LEGOLAND is simply one of the happiest places you can visit if you love LEGO.

3131,PARADISE FOR KIDS,"The kids were so excited upon entering Legoland, they didn't quite know which way to turn as everywhere you go is FUN!  Our 11 y.o boy and 8 y.o girl loved every moment of our two days alternating between Legoland and the Waterpark.  There are rides for all ages there from young to older thrill seekers.  There are rides where you get wet, and some indoors to escape the heat.  Yes, there is not much shade, and not an abundance of seating, but we seemed to go okay.  Overall a really good experience.  We were very lucky to go in the quiet time and the most we ever had to wait for a ride was about 3-4 minutes, so we were VERY lucky indeed.  We would love to go again, but if going for the first time again the kids recommended three days would have been ideal, as we really like to explore and go on the rides quite a few times. The Waterpark was smaller than expected, but adequate for our time there.  The slides were all really good, which makes it hard to decide which is best.  There is also a lazy river for the more sedate pace, as well as a wave pool.  Again, overall we really should have gone for a bit longer so we could have chilled on the lazy river for longer! ",5.0
3132,Interesting place but pls bring an umbrella there,An interesting place just across the causeway via the 2nd link. There are a few interesting rides there and it's advisable to go there early to avoid the crowd. The dragon roller coaster ride is a must. As you walk around legoland please remember to bring an umbrella with you as the heat can really knock you out. It's so hot that I wonder if the Lego pieces will melt under the heat. Do bring along your own water as theme parks drink usually are pricey. You can just walk across Legoland to the small shop in area where you can get cheaper drinks and food and if you are coming back they do allow you to re enter legoland but remember to get your hand stamped at the exit.,4.0
3133,Fun but very hot,"This is my second visit with my family, my son having a blast. The playground serve its purpose, but one thing is this place is ultra hot when the sun shine. I come from Indonesia tropical country same as Malaysia, but I can't stand the heat. Management should consider how to treat this matter",4.0
3134,Thrill & Spill Family Outing,"The water and dry parks were really awesome especially for kids below 12. Nevertheless teens and adults, also can enjoy some of the rides like the project X and The Dragon. It was not overly crowded, waiting queing time was tolerable. The Lego exhibits were great  - Star Wars not to be missed.",4.0
3135,Great fun for small kids,"This was our third time visiting Legoland in Malaysia, arriving by car from Singapore. It's a relatively short ride, which took us about an hour, including time spent going through customs. I was told it could be much longer during rush hours though.The 6 year old boy loved the rides at the water park. At 120 cm of height, he could get on all attractions, which is a big plus. Many other water parks require 130 cm or taller for some rides. We went on a week day, so there was no wait at all. After a few hours, we had tried everything, multiple times. The only complaint we had, was the thunder storm warning, which happened at least once a day. Everyone needed to stay clear of the water for at least 30 minutes. And when the sun came back out, it was super hot. So don't forget to bring a good bottle of sunscreen lotion.The theme park was equally good. The boy loved the driving school and the boat ride. There were some attractions for toddlers too, such as a small train that went around an indoor track. Again, don't forget to carry your sunscreen here.",4.0
3136,Lego Heaven,"Legoland Malaysia is exactly what it's advertised to be; an amazing fantasy land theme park for kids and adults alike who love to play with Lego. Since we were travelling from Singapore, the bus ride only took us about an hour and 30 minutes. So if you are visiting Singapore and have an extra day to spend, I highly suggest visiting Legoland Malaysia as well. We booked our trip via the hotel we were staying at. They took care of all the arrangements with the travel agency so If you are unsure how to book your trip, ask your hotel concierge for assistance. As for the park itself, it is made up of 7 themed attractions which will take you a whole day to explore. They also have a wide variety of restaurants to choose from so you will never go hungry. Although the theme park is mainly for kids, Legoland Malaysia is full of scary rides from roller coasters to water rides as well. All in all it was a great experience. The amount of Lego creations in the park was truly amazing and the staff were very friendly and helpful. I highly recommend visiting Legoland Malaysia.",4.0
3137,Fully-furnished bay care center,"We booked tickets through Asiatravel.com, and it was hassle-free. The children loved it! Rides were ok. There's a lot of activities for the kids inside air-conditioned rooms(which is best for avoiding the hot afternoon sun). Next time we'd stay longer so we can also enjoy the waterpark (which they say is the largest in the world). There are full-furnished baby care centers throughout the park (with hot/cold water, large restrooms, diaper-changing stations, high chairs for feeding toddlers, even a crib for naps!). Food is reasonably-priced. There are fastfood outlets anyway just outside the park. Bring extra clothes. Fun place!",4.0
3138,Flying Visit,"We visited here at end of Sept 2014 and booked three nights at Legoland hotel so we would have plenty of time to visit Legoland and the waterpark.   When we went here was no queues for any rides, the longest wait we had was less than 5 mins.   If you visit outside of holidays and weekends you appear to get no crowds and you can do whole park in under a day and this is going on most rides more than once and in some cases 5 times.   It is a theme park aimed at children with the more ""wilder"" rides still suitable for a 7 year old.The Mindstorm attraction is good for adults as well as children if you are interested in robotics.  Star Wars exhibit was impressive as well.The waterpark seemed to close rides down at different times during he day when we went which was a little disappointing as kids went to the large children's area later after doing all the slides to find that it was closed for remainder of the day after being open earlier in the morning.",4.0
3139,Fun filled day ;),"It was a very comfortble transfer from singapore to malaysia, my daughter enjoyed it so much, its absolutely for the kids and kids at heart. I love how they set up the store where in the kids can build their own character. The facilities are clean and staffs are very helpful. We'll definitely come back again.",5.0
3140,Family fun,"Great family fun. Started with the Water park - and enjoyed it thoroughly - kids and both of us. Good rides - safe , clean water and luckily for us wasn't crowded. Must try the raft rides as a group. Spent the 2nd half at the Lego theme park ( had a combo day ticket) . Good rides for the children and ample food options. Both my sons had a great time though my favorite would be the water park.",5.0
3141,Good family entertainment,"Our kids became Lego fans (elder influencing the younger one) over the last one year, this made our job easy to plan for the yearly vacation.  We booked our tickets to logoland with the stay at the Lego hotel. We stayed there for 3 nights and took 2 day entry pass.Kids - two boys, elder 10 years and younger hitting 3 in few months.Legoland hotel -Key points 1. Check-in time is only 4pm2. The hotel is mind blowing for the kids. Lego everywhere, our kids,for a few min, were taken aback seeing Lego everywhere and did not know where to start..3. The restaurant inside the hotel is costly 4. Just take lift down to LG2 and walk out to mall of midini, you will find a good variety of options at much less price 5. The hotel staff are at their best waiting to help you any time. Best in classRooms:1. We took Kingdom  room at 3rd floor; 2. Windows face legoland theme park; kids loved seeing legoland all day3. They have a treasure hunt for the kids to crack - fun for them4. There is a separate bunker bed for kids in adjacent room with separate TV for them5. rooms are excellent6. staff were very courteous - our elder son lost one Lego piece and requested the cstaff to help find it.. When we came back.. There was a the piece and a new set with a message from the staff to enjoy it.Legoland1. Needs one full day to complete2. Not very crowded. So there wasn't much waiting time 3. Speciality was the mini land, otherwise almost all the rides are similar to what you will find in other big theme parks4. Make sure to carry umbrella, cap and also towels.. This month it will be very hot.. Lucky for us the weather was pleasant 5. We started the day at 10:30 and completed at 6:50Water park 1. 1/2 day is sufficient to complete - but as you know, kids love water so you end up wing there for most part of the day2. Replica of adventure cove park in Singapore 3. We started by 11 and completed by 4Overall a fantastic experience for the kids ( though our younger son couldn't get into any rides, he had his own fun with Legos and at water park).We highly recommend a trip for all those Lego loving kids.Not least - we two also loved building Lego structures.. Legoland made us two also kids for a few days ",4.0
3142,For Kids Attraction,The lego block displays are amazing; the resort has numerous restaurants to choose from. But we had a wonderful time at Legoland Waterpark.  Its better to buy the combo ticket because you would really love to cool down after going around the outdoor resort.,4.0
3143,Fun not only for children!,Great recreation place for both children and children-at-hearts. Some of the rides though are not best for the faint heart. but the building exercises and the sites awed both kids and parents. Will surely wish to be back.,4.0
3144,Families with children up to 12 years old,"Most of the rides are for children.There are not many roller-coasters,but the good thing about the roller-coasters is that they can be for teens aged 12-16.The coolest part about this place is that almost everything(or in fact everything) is made up of blocks! I haven't been there since 2012(Tripadvisor is not letting me put the year 20120, and I heard that many rides have been added in,but still most rides are still suited to children.",4.0
3145,Excellent Theme Park for the Whole Family!,"This theme park is excellent for both adults and kids. Adults can enjoy the more thrilling rides while the kids can enjoy the other rides more suitable for them. Many restaurants and small kiosks selling food and drinks too, so don't worry. You won't go hungry while you are there. You can also find some nice Legoland merchandise in some of their shops. Totally recommended! My 4-year-old keeps bugging me to visit this place again.",5.0
3146,Great for children 10 years old and younger.,"Legoland Malaysia is a theme park for Lego lovers.  The rides and attractions are designed for children 10 years old and younger.  Older kids may not enjoy the thrills of the rides as much as younger kids.Good thing the Star Wars exhibition opened this May 2015!  For a Star Wars fan, this is worth the visit!  There are seven dioramas depicting multiple scenes from the movies and the cartoon series.  Several sections of each display has a moving display or light show.The staff are very helpful and friendly.  The food is expensive as it is so in all theme parks.Some of the displays in the open air Miniland are in need of maintenance- some moving displays don't work.",3.0
3147,Great for kids,Water Park was a blast. Beware height restrictions for kids- kids needs to be 90cm and above to really participate,5.0
3148,all are block-mades! Amazing!!!,"we love everything we saw here, it was weekdays when we visited this amazing land and we did a lot of fun. Few are visitors by that time so we enjoyed the rides and the water park as well. Foods in the restau are ok, kids meal is great as well, staffs are helpful and approachable.I will soon come back to this place and prepare myself for a better trip and adventure.",4.0
3149,Go during offpeak seasons!!,"We last went to Legoland with my now 6 year old and 4 year old in Dec 2014. However back then, my younger chiLD was a little too short for many of the rides so we had to skip quite a few. Seeing that the online website had an attractive May promotion, we booked tix for the dry park. May is still the school term for most Singapore and Malaysia residents so when we got to the park, we were the third car in the car park! We did see quite a few school excursion tweens as well as some Korean and Taiwanese tourists. However the park was fairly empty and so there were no queues. We spent about 6 hours in all and covered all the rides except for the two that would have gotten us wet, I.e. Dino Adventure and Wave Riders. Do note that height restrictions do apply so Children above 4 years old and minimally 1.1m in height typically need to ride with an accompanying adult. Children aged 6 and above 1.2m can ride on their own for most rides. There are quite a few air conditioned play areas for children such as build and test, academy, the theatre during nonshow times etc that allow the children to build LEGO cars and models in air conditioned comfort which provides respite from the tropical Malaysian heat and humidity. The children loved it and had fun on every single ride that they took. Food can be quite expensive like 3 ringgit for bottled water and 75 ringgit for a family pizza set for 4. ",4.0
3150,Great theme park for young kids,"The place is great for young kids, up to 12 years old I think. Once it's older than that, i think they will get bored. Anyway, I don't think older kids want to play with Lego set anymore. We came on a weekday, Friday, and the place is quiet. There is no queue on all the rides and attractions and we are able to cover all the rides and attractions in a day, plus repeats. This must be the first theme park that I've ever been where we can go to all the rides and attractions. The place is hot though, and could do with more shelter. ",5.0
3151,Fun playground for young children,"Fun playground. The facilities is quite complete, the bathroom is clean, the food is quite nice. My daughters especially loved the aquazone wave racers. We played it 4 times in the row and still cant get enough of it. But remember to play it at the last of your visit on legoland because you will definitely get wet. The down side is that there aren't enough big tree in this playground, that's why it is so hot after 10 o'clock. Be sure to drink a lot of water and bring a spare t-shirt.",4.0
3152,Hope and pray that it is cloudy,"From Singapore, there are shuttle buses that operate going to Legoland (as well as Sanrio Hello Kitty and Johor Premium Outlets) and would normally leave in the morning, going back to Singapore from 5 to 8 PM. The park is just 15 minutes from the border but take into account the bumper to bumper traffic going to Malaysian Immigration especially during long weekends. Once you have cleared immigration, travel should be smooth.The park is large and has lots of attractions and learning activities for kids. For adults, be aware that the park is geared towards kids so try to lower your expectations. However, there are not enough shades from the trees and it's so hot and humid. The last time I was there and rode the Dragon roller coaster, I was so ""lucky"" that after the roller coaster train left the castle and was already out there under the sun, it temporarily got stuck for 10min and there we were under the mercy of the blazing sun. They now have a water park in which you need to pay separately but can be bundled with the Legoland entrance fee. The Legoland hotel is also now open though we didn't stay there. The park closes early, 7PM, so try to enjoy everything before that.",4.0

3154,amazing place for kids,"LEGOLAND is truly an amazing place. I have visited the theme park, it takes around 3 to 4 hours to complete the theme park. there is also a water park. for pure vegetarian people its a problem so I suggest them to take food along with them. the climate there is very hot n sometimes rainy .there  is also a place in theme park called miniland which is THE BEST PLACE in it cos all monuments in there are made of lego  pieces . the bathroom there is very very clean which is actually great . I suggest all people who are reading this to go during weekdays excluding Friday cos then u can do many rides again n again. And if u r from Singapore then all the shops n counters accept sgd. there are 6 places in LEGOLAND theme park (excluding miniland) . when u enter LEGOLAND u will see a shop beside u where there is a man with camera made out of lego pieces infront of that u will find map for the theme park n many figures are mage of lego pieces with really amazing n is great for taking photos of u n your family n etc . very great place for enjoying for staying purpose u can live in the LEGOLAND hotel. there is also a train in which we can sit n experience the view of miniland  THANKS for reading this review.",4.0

3157,"LegoLand, Malaysia","Not so suitable for age 3 years old and below or height below 100 cm. Other than that, the kids enjoyed themselves at the stations where they allow 3 years old kids. Do get prepared with lots of water and umberella/hat as the park is very hot with not many sheltered areas. The food quality in the theme park is pretty lousy so might want to consider to pack your own food or have your lunch outside. The water them park is a little small and more suitable for grown-ups or bigger kids, not many areas to play/go to for kids around 3 years and below. ",4.0
3158,More for kids play,"Bought a cheaper than counter tickets through a Sg tour agency for entry to both the themeparks. Space was huge but the shows and rides were more suitable for kids play.

Overall, it was okay for the price we paid and both themeparks could be covered in a day.",3.0

3165,LEGOLAND - the different theme park,"Legoland is the first theme park by LEGO outside europe in asia and more may soon follow in dubai and china, but currently this is the only one in asia. This is exciting theme park for all ages especially kids and everything made in lego bricks and pieces. The main attraction was a very big display of monuments from around the world including temples, airports , ports made complete from lego pieces with cars moving. this is really a fest to the eyes, in the way this has been constructed using thousands of pieces and in a very colorful. Other good thing is the STAR wars indoor theme which displays all the seven episodes of the movie in LEGO pieces which actual moving warships and robots.Overall LEGOLAND is a full day attraction and the best time to visit is end of april , before the vacation season starts so that you can enjoy all the rides multiple times else u have to wait for hours due to the mad rush.",4.0
3166,Worth a visit if you have young children,I was there with my 5 year old son and wife. The boy cannot ride in some of the rides but there are enough for him to enjoy. This is a more family place.

3167,Family fun at the amusement park!,"This was a family day of fun! My son is a big fan of Lego, so he had a blast! He got a chance to get a driver license and also drive in a car!

There are coach service that you can book to travel from Singapore into Johor Bahru, so it is very convenient!",5.0
3168,My kids had a blast !!,"We stayed at the Legoland Resort.  My boys love all things Lego.  This was a dream vacation for them.  We bought a 2-day combo entry to the water park and the dry park at a reduced price offered to guests of the Resort.  My 11 yr old and 7 yr old had a blast, especially at the water park.  The rides are a lot of fun and my 7 yr old was able to get on all the rides as long as he was accompanied by an adult.  Bathing attire is a requirement to use some of the rides at the water park.  We were able to do both parks in one day.  There are locker facilities available to store your things for a fee.  The food was mediocre in the park.  It is definitely a family friendly place.",5.0
3169,Fine themepark,"Went there with my girlfriend, Location is great as we spent less then an hour to come from Singapore...The attraction was existing for my girlfriend and for most of the kids but not for me....i suggest there should be a more ""High Level"" attraction for adults......quite a lot of Lego model available....interesting!!!Overall it's a great themepark, would like to try the Legoland Hotel and waterpark next time!!!",4.0
3170,Fantastic theme park for the little ones....,"Less than an hour from Singapore in the car, a fantastic theme park for young kids. If they love playing with Lego, they will have a ball here. Our kids were 5 and 3, and they could enjoy almost all of the rides, so well worth the entry.. (unlike other theme parks where they can only go on a fraction of the rides.. and then having to wait in massive queues.) Although incredibly hot (40 degrees), as we visited mid week, there were virtually no queues and so we went straight onto the rides, interspersed with some of the indoor airconditioned attractions, and water rides.  Staying overnight at LegoLand Hotel was a highlight - brilliant setup for families, with themed rooms (we had the pirate room - with pirate lego decorations everywhere!!) with bunk bed/trundle for kids in one room, and a separate king bedroom for the adults. They even have a treasure hunt for the kids ...and upon discovering the clues unlock the treasure chest (i.e.: safe combo) to receive a Lego gift each. Highly recommended..",4.0
3171,Themepark for Family and Friends,"If you are with friends and the type of person to ride each attraction once, then you can visit both theme park and water park in one whole day. However, if you are with kids, or the type of person who rides a single attraction a couple of times, you have to allocate one day each park.  It is worth your money and time to visit Legoland, although like all theme parks, i find their gift items very expensive. I was hoping that Lego at legoland will be cheaper compared to retail shops inside malls.",4.0

3173,Great theme park.,"When I went there,I had the pleasure of a lifetime. The  waterpark  were cool, the rides was very pleasing and most of all the food. It was delicious like you were drooling for real. For anybody who wishes to go there,I would recommend the car ride and the boat ride.",4.0
3174,Themepark for Kids,"I went to the Legoland Malaysia Themepark. Best for kids as there are few places to play but limited for adult to enjoy. Limited shelter as the scorching sun is shining brightly directly to us, or even the heavy rain like what I encuntered. During the time I went, it is very inconvinience . Plus the carpark is quite far from the themepark.. Thats an additional minus point.Food place is not bad, have more than 1 variety but places to sit isnt much is cleaned ones. The cleaner seems very limited. Will have to think twice if I were to go again in future. Perhaps follow up on the shelter wise and such, as stated as per above. Thanks and hope to come again with a re-newed Legoland.",2.0
3175,Has much potential to be even better,"Best theme park in Johor (actually the only one of this size). I'm an annual pass holder, so I go pretty frequently. It's great for kids below 12... super awesome fun... brought my nephew (aged 4) there for the first time 2 years ago... refused to go home. That was the scene at the exit of Legoland... kids of primary school age bawling their eyes out coz no one wants to go home! Kids love it that much! If you're an adult looking to go without kids... please don't waste your time. There are about 5 jungle gyms there... your kids can spend all day there. The rides are pretty decent for the kids, mots of them will love it. Now there's a water park too still a bit new... and lacking some rides but like I said this place has got potential to be much better. The Star Wars section is pretty small and basic when it was just opened, I understand that they've expanded it. Should be awesome being a Star Wars year this year? Food and drinks easily available, a little pricey but still ok, don't go buy food during lunch... que is mad. Weekends very packed, have to que very long for the popular rides, weekdays dont have to que for rides.The biggest negative thing is the HEAT! It's Malaysia!!!! They should've planted more trees etc. To be fair to Legoland, they heeded the public's complaint about the heat and put up several shades.  But alas... still woefully inadequate. Hope they will continue to address the weather issues. Toilets are super clean and cool! sometimes I stay in the toilet longer as refuge from the heat! hahaha ",4.0

3178,Great place to visit ,"Asian theme parks seem to be less crowded, cheaper and more friendly than those in US or Europe.First of all the staff are simply amazing and from the cleaners to the welcome team they are always happy and seem like they want to be there - nothing seemed too hard for them - not like the sad looks and groans you often get in other parks.The rides were ok but it is more for younger kids say below 12 or nostalgia fans - the rides are good but olde kids will get bored after a few rides. The water park is quite fun.Be prepared to get wet, be prepared for heat and even though some things are expensive its lower than other countries regardless - got some photos, some food and souvenirs and none if it broke the bank.Hot tips are to use the shops just outside the park and book a mind storms session early as it is a lot if fun.It's well serviced by busses even for tourists not wanting to cab it - bus is dirt cheap compared to cab.",5.0
3179,Fun for the children,"Lots of space for children to have fun. You could queue up for rides, play at the many playgrounds, walk around the mini world, build lego, etc. Food selection is ok. Wonderful nursing area with baby changing stations, baby high chair for feeding, cots and even toilets. Suitable for the very young to older children.Do apply lots of sunblock or bring an umbrella as it can get very very hot.",4.0
3180,Trip with friends,"Queue for an hour for theme park entrance ticket, because we are using voucher from watson. Is better if you could buy it online. Have lunch before enter into legoland. It will help you to save some money. Lego shops are besides the entrance / exit. You can get lego, shirts, cap and etc.We enter at 1pm and leave at 6pm. We had some activities in legoland like ride on roller coaster, 4D movie etc.a camera is a must! although there are camera man around, but the photo selling price are expensive. Wear sport shoes / flat shoe & comfortable outfit, because you gonna walk around for whole afternoon. Apply sunblock!Everything is awesome!! Enjoy!",4.0
3181,"Perfect for children and ""mature"" children","As a child, Lego was my favourite toy. This was the random blocks in red, white, yellow, and blue, and did not come with an instruction manual. I'm from the Philippines and the nearest Legoland to us was the one in Malaysia. Having Lego in my childhood motivated me to visit the park.WHEN WE VISITED: First Saturday of MayWHO WE ARE: I went with my siblings, our ages are 28, 26, and 18. I am a young lawyer, my sister is a young physician, and my brother was entering college. My brother did not really play with the actual Lego bricks growing up but he loved the Lego-tie up video games.PURCHASING TICKETS: We bought the tickets a day before the actual visit through the Legoland Malaysia website. You will have to print the tickets and use the barcode to enter the park. This is better because you skip the long queues buying the ticket, and it was the same price. Although I will advice to plan ahead and buy tickets in advance because they give discounts if you buy earlier.GETTING THERE: We were visiting family friends in Singapore and we were staying at the northern area. Going to Marina Bay to avail of WTS coach services seemed counterintuitive and inconvenient. So we took the MRT to Woodlands. The Woodlands Bus Interchange was the first stop for SMRT 950. The bus will stop at Woodlands Checkpoint, and passengers have to disembark (tap out and the ride will be suspended) to get through Singapore immigration. We were able to resume our ride on the same bus (we were able to tell by the driver), but you could also take the next 950 bus if you are stalled in immigration. The bus then crosses over the border and we were brought to Malaysian immigration. This is the part where we got a bit lost and ended up in the platform of buses going back to Singapore instead of JB Sentral, where the bus to Legoland was located. So getting out of immigration, you should follow the signs that state ""JB Sentral"" instead of bus platform. Because we made a mistake, we ended up taking SBS Bus 170 to Larkin Sentral. This was okay because the bus that goes to Legoland, Causeway Link bus LM1 stops at both JB Sentral and Larkin Sentral. LM1 follows a schedule but make sure to be about 15 minutes early for the scheduled departure. So we boarded the LM1 bus at around 9:15, and we got to Legoland at 9:55. Including wait time, traffic, and immigration it took us less than 3 hours to get from Sembawang, Singapore to Johor Bahru.ATTRACTIONS: We were so lucky that on our visit, the special exhibit was STAR WARS MINILAND. We love Star Wars so much. The exhibit was in homage to International Star Wars Day, and I think they had more activities on May 3 and 4. Nevertheless, we enjoyed the special Star Wars Exhibition. The exhibit starts with a short film on Jarjar Binks, in an alternative narrative where he was the accidental hero of the Star Wars Universe. We were able to take photos with Lego Darth Vader and enjoyed the interactive displays of the different planets highlighted in each Star Wars movie. Even for non-fans, the displays are majestic. The Millennium Falcoln was really big, and you could find little details and scenes from the Star Wars movies. I can't describe it enough. It was awesome. At the end of the exhibit there's a dedicated store for Lego Star Wars merchandise.We only visited the Theme Park but even if you're just visiting the theme park, consider bringing a wet suit. There were a lot of fun rides that involve water, and the riders really get DRENCHED. There's a drying station but you have to pay 10 RM to use, so I think a full complement of extra clothes, or rash guards and swimwear will be useful if you want to enjoy those rides.The park itself was enjoyable because every corner is photogenic and ""Instagrammable"". The Miniland is the best place for that, and it's worth taking the guided tour held at 2PM. Our guide, Ezzy, showed us the ""easter eggs"" in the display, like Spiderman climbing the Suria KLCC, and the little pandas behind the Forbidden City.Other attractions we loved: Project X, The Dragon Apprentice, and The Dragon. They were all rollercoaster rides. The rollercoasters were exciting but not that scary. Beginner rollercoasters.We also signed up for a Mindstorm class. We programmed a Lego robot to accomplish a mission. We didn't accomplish the mission but it was fun. Plus, the venue was air-conditioned.However, there is one attraction that was only good for the air-conditioning. It was the 4-D show. We caught the Chima in 4-D. The audio was so bad. I couldn't hear anything. The 3-D rendering was good, but there was nothing 4-D about it except there was cold foam during the part where the characters were going through waterfalls. For me, it was a waste of time.FOOD: Food was okay. We availed of a Pizza promo in Pizza Mania. The package was good for four and included a 14"" pizza, four soups, and four drinks for 75 RM. We also ate overpriced ice cream, but it was worth it considering the heat.SOUVENIRS: Aside from 4-D, this was my next source of disappointment. There were a lot of Legos that are not available in your usual toy store, but I was really looking forward to more Legoland merchandise. Unfortunately, even after checking all the stores, the selection was limited. Universal Studios Singapore was more diverse and had souvenirs for all ages. Here the things are too kiddie, if they're not actual Legos.OVERALL: The trip to Legoland was Very Good. We went on a weekend, but the crowds were manageable. The longest queue we did for a ride was 30 minutes. Some people say it's just for kids, but for me, it's also for mature, responsible children. Like us. :D",4.0
3182,Everthing is Awesome!,"Spent three days at this wonderful hotel and theme park, celebrating my wife's 50th Birthday. Yes she's a big kid at heart. My two boys, aged 12 & 16 loved the place. From the moment we arrived  to the time we reluctantly left, was fun, fun, fun. We were lucky enough to be there during off peak so there weren't big crowds and no waiting in line for rides. We had a Pirate themed room which was spacious and comfortable, not that we spent a lot of time in it. The restraint and buffet breakfast was nice. Would recommend this place to everyone for a family holiday. The staff are friendly and looked after our every need.",5.0
3183,"Young or Old, Legoland strikes Gold!","Majority of you will be visiting Singapore and then figuring out if you should make the trip to Legoland in Malaysia.  From the Tuas Second Link (Singapore to Malaysia) via car, it is literally less than 15mins away (assuming you don't get lost).Was not the first time we visited but this time we stayed overnight at the hotel (Everything is AWESOME!  of cos). Tourist coming from Singapore can pick up tickets and comfortable air conditioned bus transport from the Singapore flyer (round trip).Visited the park in the day time... kids ran around like crazy bees.  Make sure they hydrate!  Good thing about the park is that the rides are so kid friendly that most do not require adult accompaniment (unless they dont make the height requirements).SUNBLOCK required!The theme park aint that big so we hit the water park slightly after 3PM (arrived at the park at 10AM).Water park slides are AWESOME (Just like Lego's ""Everything is...).  Great way to cool down!  It is bigger than Adventure Cove, Sentosa.Now... the hotel... (WOO HOOO!) is at a whole different level.  Inspiring from the moment you enter the carpeted lobby all the way to the rooms (see photos).  There is a locked safe where the munchkins have to break the lock code by answering some clues...  The smarties will be rewarded by Lego treasures, of cos!  Awesome no?We fine-dined at the Italian restaurant.  It has wine!  (woo hoo!  Awesome) and the service was simply out of this World.  How awesome?  My mother wrote a excellent review of the wait staff's service and submitted to management the next day.All in all, wholesome family fun since ""everything is awesome... everything is fun when you're part of a team...""",5.0

Star wars characters were doing their walk about.   Something new for us was the Lego Friends Live show & the 4D shows. The kids had great fun.The quality of employees need to be improved though, there are some who are really enthusiastic and lively (definitely add to our fun) while some were just there to do their duty.The next visit I would surely want to stay at the LEGOLAND Hotel. The price for the hotel during this super peak period was way over our budget.",4.0

3192,Top Park in the Region!,"For Lego Lovers and Non-Lego Lovers alike!This is the place for thrills, enjoyment & creative amusement!Cleverly mapped out just like all the other Legoland Parks across the world. The high international standards are faithfully maintained here. The place has managed to maintain its top top condition after welcoming guests for a few years now. Facilities are plenty and clean. Sufficient kiosks for snacks and thirst quenchers. There are also cafes in each land to refuel and the quality is pretty good. Check out the photo booths after each ride - some may be worth the buy for keepsake. Lines were not a problem for us on 1 May. Weather was kind too. It is sunny Malaysia so just need to put on sunscreen & positive attitude, FUN would be inescapable. Note: - all rides can be experienced in one day- much more convenient to stay at the hotel- strollers are available for rent- there are prayer rooms, lockers & benches for rest",5.0
3193,"""Legoland"" a sauna","We travelled to LEGOLAND with our 2.5 year old, I was curious how the experience would be because we read that most of it was outside. With a 2.5 year old you want fun and comfort at the same time. Unfortunately is was a very sunny day and no wind....our daughter was sweating and quiet after 10 minutes already. There are things inside but mostly its building things, no attractions. She wanted to play in a play are under a tent and it was unbearable. There were huge fans but they were off...or not working? We sat and had to cool off after 1 hour in a restaurant....I would recommend this park if you are prepared for the discomfort and the heat, and I think we were not the only ones thinking that because the park was practically empty and it was a Saturday.... also, not really suitable for 2,3 or 4 year olds. I think that you get more out of it with older children, so they can go to every attraction. I also thought it was more a attraction park with a lego theme, not much lego except for the miniature village...I think this park would do much better with more attractions inside. So at least as a customer you have the choice, at the end of the day the typical rain and thunder came and the park was empty.",2.0

From the moment we arrived, right at the lobby is like a big ocean of Legos. It's like a dream come true to Lego lovers. He had fun with the treasure hunting in the room and I would say the amenities were excellent. It is really a place for family with small children (up to teenagers). The services from the staff were amazing, everyone's helpful and friendly, they even gave us a breakfast parcel for three as our flight was at 7am and the restaurant opened at 7:30am. The food in the restaurant are good but I found it quite expensive.  And most of all, my son's favorite was the elevator because of the disco lights and ball!!!",5.0
3196,Especially for Kids,Legoland here I came. Actually I have heard about it time to time from friends but not really a fan of Lego so I wasn't pay attention that much. We supposed to go to Melaka for a night so we decided to stop by at legoland on the way. The ticket normal price for 160 RM (foreigners price and local price are different this is the FP) but if you pay with the participate selected credit card you will get a discount for 30 RM. From Johor Bahru immigration it took 30 mins to arrive there. There is an exhibition of Starwars starting from May 2015.There are 2 sections of the park the theme park and the water park ^^,4.0
3197,LOVED our trip here - go off peak and it's almost empty,"We visited on a weekday (non-school holiday) and had the place virtually to ourselves.  We walked onto almost every ride without queuing and could stay on the ride for another turn if we chose to.  With the park being so empty, we went on every ride in a day.  We had purchased a two day combo ticket and in hindsight maybe 1 day would have been enough, but if the park was busier 2 days is just right.  We visited the water park too and loved that.  Remember your swimming clothes as it is really expensive to buy them there.  Many people played in the water with their normal clothes on but you cannot use the slides unless you are wearing proper swimming clothes.  My brave and tall 6 year old was happy to go on all the slides.You are not allowed to take food and water into the park.  If you buy a combo ticket (Legoland & water park) you can leave the park to buy food from a selection of restaurants outside the main gate but not it you have a LEGOLAND only ticket.",5.0
3198,Fun but oh so hot,"Spent a full day in the dry park, even though we found any excuse to get wet to try to cool down!!  Restaurant was nicely air-conditioned. Kids loved everything (as expected). One improvement needed is to have some pictures or something on the rides that are located in a building so you know what it is as the names didn't help. I felt like I was constantly asking ""what's in here??"".",4.0
3199,If your kids like Lego then visit,"I visited in Jan 2014.We drove from KL to Johur Bahru with friends and stayed there for two nights . One night is enough if you are in a rush.Compared to Universal Studios in Singapore, it won't win. However, for a Lego lover it is a good attraction. The rides are similar to all the other theme parks. From my point of view, as a Dad, the best part was the smart Legos section. In there my son and I got introduced to Lego Mindstorms. I actually ended up buying the EV3 for my son few months later. If your kid is 8 or above, make sure that he/she give this a try. For the younger ones, they can also enjoy building Lego in there.I would recommend arriving early and also to keep away from weekends and holidays to avoid the long queues. If you want to buy Lego then this is the right place to buy it especially for the sale items. I hesitated and just bought few little things but after comparing prices with the Middle East, it is much less. Perhaps if you are coming from US or Europe, that could be different. But still a deal is a deal, so if it's on sale then it is a good price. On the other hand, if your kid want specific pieces then this is the place to buy. You can buy pieces by kg. For example you can buy 500gms of wheels.",4.0

The queue was short, but we still need full whole day to complete all rides even with 5 mins queue or less per attractions.

While my child could hop on most rides, there were rides that he was told he was too small for even though he was the right height and I had even seen smaller children than him go on them.  This broke my child's heart.  The Lego water park was good, I would recommend hiring a cabana",2.0
3205,Entertainment for every age group.,"We had a ball at Legoland Park, we spent two half days at the park as it does get quite warm although with plenty of shaded seating, cool treats, indoor play area and mini movies this really isn't a problem. My children range from 7 to 12 and I was worried about my oldest getting bored but with all the great rides there was no time for that.

3206,Educationally entertaining,"They have very good rides mostly good for kids even the The Dragon is a thrilling experience. They also that the Lego Mindstorms and Build City where kids can play lego all they want, very comfy inside as it is air-conditioned. I wish there were more shaded area in the park because the weather can be very warm and uncomfortable. I was very impressed with their Star Wars section and looking forward if they would soon have rides themed after Star Wars. The collection is just grand and amazing and every Star Wars fans would love it here. I went here twice, November and April and at both times it rained in the afternoon, but only less than an hour. Even if there's no more rain, some rides are closed because of the weather which I don't get because there's no more rain. So I would suggest that you go right first upon entering the park and get to enjoy the cars for the kids.",4.0
3207,First blockbuster theme park @Malaysia,"We are excited to visit the theme park in Malaysia of Lego. We stay at Johor Bahru town near Singapore checkpoint border and the driving takes almost 30 to 45 minutes distance which is not really convenient for tourist. As for the locals we have own transport and there are a huge area of parking space next to the mall at Legoland.Here is my review on Legoland: - Attraction Highlight: Legoland divided into 4 huge sections based on my personal conceptual view of Legoland (direction facing the mini-land). The center is the mini land, where all little city built by LEGO. Then on the right sector is where all the transportation rides e.g. train, boat, fire engine etc. The third sector at the far north is the exploration where the observation deck, Lego movie & Lego school is located there. Then on the left sector consist of adventure and also Star Wars attraction. Star Wars would be my top pick and not to be miss attraction where the fans able to see the miniature of star wars episode in LEGO.Attraction Tip: Star Wars or Observation deck area is indoors and should always schedule last. Start with the outdoor like miniland and the transportation ride from the beginning especially in the morning when it is not so hot and sometimes late evening may have rain as well. Legoland really suitable for younger kids as there are few playgrounds and relax rides available at the park.",3.0
3208,Cool attraction!,"I grew up playing Lego with my brother and was quite excited to visit this place. If you‚Äôre an avid fan of Lego, this might be the place to visit. Beautiful Lego structures of famous places and buildings caught my attention: Petronas Tower, Forbidden City, Merlion, Angkor Wat temples among others. What I enjoyed was viewing the STAR WARS collection! Seeing the LEGO structures of Darth Vader, R2-D2, C-P3O, Princess Leia, Han Solo, and Yoda excites me! I love STAR WARS and completed the keychains sold in the LEGOLAND Shop! Hahaha. Me and my friend also rode the roller coaster which was fun! You could see the LEGOLAND hotel and other views when riding the roller coaster. The weather can be unpredictable so make sure to bring an umbrella or a raincoat. It can either be too sunny and hot, or cool and rainy! It changes quite fast too. XD We ate at a restaurant inside the LEGOLAND; they got different dishes for you to choose from. Overall, LEGOLAND is for kids and the young at heart. Enjoy it while it lasts. I recommend that you avail of the Build-Your-Own-Lego Figurine which is cheaper than buying just one figurine. You can also choose different Lego bricks, weigh them and pay at the counter. This is good for kids because building Lego bricks will bring out their creativity! :)Warning: We rode a blue taxi (just outside Legoland) going back to our ""hotel"" and noticed that the meter of the taxi adds RM too fast!!! We didn't want to argue with the taxi driver coz he might get mad or do something bad. in the end, we paid more than the intended fare. Example: from our hotel to Legoland - RM 20 ; but from Legoland to hotel - RM 43! Thanks for reading my review! Please visit and follow my Instagram @sarahmaytanhuancoSee you there! ;)",3.0

There are some really fun rides, including the roller coasters, log ride and 4d movies. Take sunscreen as it get's a bit hot!worth the visit from Singapore, it isn't too far.",4.0

3212,Expensive but worth it as a treat,"We arrived from the airport about 10am and were very impressed.  The luggage hold system is well run as lots of guests obviously use it while they are at legoland.  We bought the 2 day pass which was cheaper with the hotel booking and that was definitely worth it. We went straight to legoland, then back to check in to our rooms at 3pm, and then back to legoland again. The second day we went between the water park and legoland. The rooms that you see on the website are pretty accurate. Our kids are 11, 13 and 14 but they all loved it.  Staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Breakfast had an amazing choice and we all left very satisfied.  The lego models around the hotel were fantastic and the music in the lifts is great. I think our favourite part was the minifigure swap system they have. We had so much fun trading and retrading. It was a very expensive stay as our 2 oldest children counted as adults so we needed 2 rooms which I think is very wrong as there were beds in one room they could have used. I think children under 16 should be allowed to stay in the same room if there are beds available. We will not be returning soon mainly because of the cost, but if you can afford it it is well worth the stay.  It made the visit to the park so much more enjoyable being able to go in and out over the 2 days.",5.0
3213,Good for kids... not too exciting for adults,"Legoland Malaysia is an excellent theme park for kids. There are plenty of activities and attractions for them. On the other hand, the attractions for adults are limited. Appart from some rides and the impressive Lego sculptures of asian monuments, there is not much left for an adult to do. Another thing: The park should have more shade places so visitors can escape from the inclement sunlight. The day we visited Legoland was very sunny and extremely hot. Luckily, I had brought an umbrella and could manage it a bit, but still, it was very uncofortable walking around from each attraction under the hot weather. My suggestion is to build covered walkways that protect the people from the sun and the rain.",3.0
3214,Nice attractions and rides but beware of the weather,"The rides were enjoyed much by my 5-year old sun. The waterpark is also very good. The staff are friendly. Be wary, however, of the weather. Of the two days we were there, it was very hot in the morning but it rained in the afternoon. Good thing that we have a multiple entry pass, hence, we were able to move from the themepark and the waterpark based on the weather. The food in the Beach Grill in the waterpark is not good. Much better if you can eat at the mini-mall in front.",4.0

The food sold there quite pricey as expected but they do have big portion. Two people can just share one meal. They have nice selection of lego stuff. They should mention earlier before any rides where they would be taking picture of us so we look at the camera and smile. They didnt remind of say where is their camera so we all look shocked, eyes closed or didnt look at camera when they took the picture.

A red taxi from JB Sentral costs around RM30 and its on the meter.  We found a really good taxi driver who picked us up from our hotel.  Taxis back from Legoland can be got at the end of the mall and are more expensive because they are the bigger blue ones, it cost us around RM 55.  It was very hot but we all really enjoyed it.

Water should be free especially its very hot and so humid. At least they can improve the park by adding some covered walk like in USS. Water again, should be free and accessible considering the sunny weather. Star wars movie can be improved more i guess, it was kinda dull and boring movie experience.. at least 4D experience or something interactive? The 4D theatre had some technical glimpse and we decided to go out. Umbrella is a must, but if it rains, since the park is widely open, you will be wet.Overall it was fun and I guess need more improvement.",3.0

Once inside, you have to pay for more attractions (not covered in the one charge). You also have to pay extra to access the water park, which I would think would be a given in the heat that Malaysia experiences. It was very hot and there were not a lot of areas to keep cool.

3224,A real adventure for those who are not yet teenagers and their families.,Legoland Malaysia is an exceptional fun park which is great for 12 years and under. Unless the teenagers are really into lego I think the park may be a bit tame for them as the rides are not exceedingly fast. It was great for our family and I would highly recommend teaming it with a night or two at the Legoland hotel. We spent a full day going around this fun park and there were almost no queues so it is definitely a full day if you intend on going on everything,5.0
3225,No Queue Yay!,"This is our second visit. We went there on Monday to avoid the crowd. Yeah the place was quite peaceful on Monday compared to our previous trip on weekend.We purchased the Theme Park tickets for MYR135 and get another 35% discount with Maybank card. So we only pay MYR87 and get another MYR10 for food coupon.Got plenty of new rides and almost no queue yay!. The foods options were varied and inexpensive. Many lego products on SALE!, you can get it as cheap as MYR10. A full day can easily be spent and 2 days even better if you want to venture to the Lego water park. A less chaotic place compared to other theme parks which was great since shorter queues means more rides.",5.0

3229,Great for small children - Part 2,"Well, I booked transfer with WTS Travel on Friday, 2-April, which must have been the busiest day at Singapore/Malaysia border. Coach transfer from Singapore Flyer to Legoland took 2.5 hours (9am to 11:30am).Still very good for children under 14 yo.Tips:1. Make sure to checkout show timetable and arrive 30 minutes before, as it is air-conditioned and there are kids lego buskets to play with.2. Do no follow map from 1 to 45, go backwards (anti-clock wise).3. Singaporeans use ""dual-line-up"" tactic, where father and mother will stand in different queues then everyone merge to a shorter line. DO THE SAME!4. ""Thai-coin"" scam, a lot of shopkeepers will give you Thai coins instead of Singapore coins as change. Some as very similar size and weight. You will end up with lots of useless Thai coins with a ""guy in glasses"" with no English characters. BECAREFUL!5. Kids under 7 yo, goto ""Ticket office"" and get free MRT cards.",5.0
3230,Theme park from hell,"Let's start with the positives.1. We went on a weekday so no lines.2. Courteous staff3. Reasonably priced food4. Kid friendly atmosphere5. Reasonable ticket price6. 4D shows different per half hourLet's get to tue grit of it. Why do I think it's the theme park from hell?1. Park hours. 10am-6pm. This may work for europe or USA where it's a lot cooler, but when you're in Malaysia, boy... You're going to be sweating like a pig by 11am. Legoland management is going to say: we can't do anything about the heat. My answer: do something about park hours! Make it until at least 8pm so when the sun goes down, we can enjoy your park more. In our visit, it was so hot in the morning until 3pm so we couldn't walk in the sun too much for the risk of skin cancer. Suddenly, at 3pm, it rained like there was no tomorrow. So we never got to enjoy the park. What a friggin waste of money. Yes legoland, you don't control weather, but you can do a lot about your park hours.2. Park attractions. It's only been 3 years since the opening of the park but I see poor maintenance. Paint fading, rides dirty, dirty carpet, etc.3. International signs. Yes we understand that we are in Malaysia, but since you are an international company, why not have some English translation as well? You are very inconsistent, some have translations, some have none. Easily fixed guys!4. Shops. We know you have your Big Shop at the main entrance, but did you know that your so-called big shop is the size of a small shop in Disneyland Hong Kong. You have to have better merchandise or at least more merchandise.5. Dull park areas. There are a lot of areas in the park where there are rooms to build legos. I see these as fillers. These are dull areas in the park. You have a lot of attractions but some of them are redundant.6. This is what ticked me off the most. SEXISM IN THE Amenities. There is a baby care area. i came with my 9 month old son and 5 year old daughter. I ASKED TO GO TO THE BABY CARE AREA, BUT I WAS REFUSED ENTRY. ONLY WOMEN ARE ALLOWED THERE. Why? ARE WOMEN THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO TAKE CAREOF CHILDREN? WAKE UP! It's 2015! Dads care for their children too. The person in the area said that some mothers breastfeed there. So what? Make them private breastfeeding areas! If there's none, I guarantee you I won't look! I had to go to a very dirty family room to change my son's soiled diaper. There was crap on the diaper changing table. YES, THERE WAS CRAP ON THE DIAPER CHANGING TABLE in the family room beside the pizza place. I had to clean it up myself. Too bad I didn't have my phone or I would have posted it all over the internet.I tried to stay positive throughout the day even if nothing was going right, but the baby care area was the last straw. I couldn't even clean up my kid in a clean place.If you think I'm being unfair, look up my review of your hotel, it was excellent. I loved it there but it didn't carry over to your park. It's a theme park from hell.",1.0
3231,Excellent Theme Park,"The big Lego logo shown that I had arrived Legoland, I was very excited!!!!Not so many people there so I could enjoyed all games :) It was so hot and I really enjoyed the water boat games ( I got all wet, lol).Lots of good place to take photos, lots of attraction that made of Lego block!!!!! Amazing Theme Park, highly recommend to all of you!!",5.0
3232,kids trip,kids had a great time .. my son especially is a great fan of the lego stuff and spent the whole day without an iota of tiredness !! ( any other place m they would have been up in arms against us ) ,5.0
3233,A bit rubbish tbh,Come when the Malaysian and Singaporean kids are at school and there are no queues. Brilliant! But there's also no atmosphere! You can walk freely pretty much on to all the rides with little or no wait. It just feels a little flat though with no sense of anticipation and all over too quickly. It's hot in Malaysia (versus Legoland Windsor where you can bank on rain) so come prepared with appropriate clothing and sunscreen. Didn't try the water park.... Perhaps next time? Although not sure we will be back tbh,2.0
3234,Great park! Brick by brick,"This is a great park, it gets hot but in this part of the globe what isn't - on this day the queues were almost non-existant. The staff is quiet but friendly when interacting with them.  The brand is amazing and it's really great watching all the kids engage with the different experiences around the park.",5.0
3235,Fun day,"Having been to the one in the USA and spending most of our time queuing for rides, I was skeptical about visiting this one. The highlight for us was the park was empty which meant we could stay on a ride and go on it multiple times! ",4.0
3236,Legoland - fun for the family,"We spent two days at Legoland as a family. My kids are 7 & 9 years of age - a boy and a girl - and the park is perfectly created from toddlers to 12 year olds. Parents are certainly part of the well-planned fun. We tried everything, trust me EVERYTHING!! Ok, maybe not the baby Duplo park... The most wonderful thing was that it was obviously off-season and we did all favourite rides 3-4 times with almost little waiting time. There was also a show with Lego Friends which my daughter could not stop raving about. I will say that 2 full days at the park is enough. Trust me, its enough.The Water park was a real hit with Dad doing every ride with the kids. There was no stopping him! The kids were like jack rabbits with unending enthusiasm carrying oversized floating tubes up the long flight of steps just to ride the most outrageous  structures. My 7 year old was fearless even when I thought she would not be. The kids then did the wave rides by themselves and the water mini park. It got very full by noon, so go early! The public bathrooms are hot and not well ventilated with few hooks and benches to place your clothes and bags. It also gets very crowded and I would not leave the kids alone, if I were a single parent.The main draw was the Legoland hotel. Expect a mad-house of yelling, happy, crazy kids. The rooms were family oriented with kids and adult robes, kids and adult bedroom slippers, kids and adult wash basins, kids and adult cups and kids bunk beds. We stayed at a premium Kingdom room and you know its a Kingdom room because the ""kingdom theme"" is everywhere - the walls, the floor carpet, the Lego models, the pillowcases, the curtains.... Breakfast was a mad place with a large buffet of every kind, disorganised staff and just a lot of noise. But Emmett made a visit and we had a treasure chest in the room and kids were just oblivious to anything other than Lego which was everywhere. Don't forget that you get to trade your Lego miniature with anyone who has a badge saying ""trade with me"". We only felt a little sad that the store didn't have my son's fave Star Wars set which he had set his heart on..selection is limited, be warned.All in all, we had a good time and now that we hear Legoland will open in Japan in 2017, here we come!",5.0
3237,Disappointing and not worth going..,"This was a family outing comprising about 30 adults & teenagers. We thought to give this place a try since it was quite near & it also sounded different from other theme parks. Everyone knows the LEGO brand. So our expectations was high.But it turned out to be very disappointing. Nothing extraordinary & the park is not well managed - from the ways the rides are managed, information not properly given for closures or delays of rides and not well maintained facilities.In our opinions, it was a waste of time & money. Universal Studios in Singapore is so much bigger and better. Will not come here again",2.0
3238,"Everything was awesome, kids loved it","This was great experience for my 4 children and myself..The younger ones enjoyed the LEGO City rides, while the older kids enjoyed the roller coasters, I loved the mini lego City which recreate the worlds most famous buildings in LEGO. Not bad value for money, there where few lines and very short wait times for rides You will need all day to get around the park and all the rides..Tak plenty of water as it does get hot but there are also plenty of indoor air conditioned activities so you can cool down.",4.0
3239,It was different,"We got a tour from Singapore to Lego Land, The whole experience was great.. the rain was on & off that was a bit annoying.. This place wasn't what we expected and it felt like it was still under construction, there wasn't much to do.. the best bit of the whole trip was walking through the star wars exhibition. We will definitely not returning again. But don't let this review deter you from going and experiencing lego land fro your self",2.0

3242,Very good amusement,"Nice to visit both parks (Water and Lego). Buy the tickest before on internet, because the waiting line is loong. The lines inside of the Park are just by some attractions.",5.0
3243,From Singapore,"I come to this place direct from Singapore, we use cab. Take about 1 hour. This place good for kids as other. Legoland located outside of the city. So, before i reach this place, i was thinking, where are they? Since i saw many jungle before i reach it.Then~... amazing... i found this complette facility of kids entertaining. This place manage well and proffesional. Dont miss it for your trip in Singapore/Johor Bahru.  ",4.0
3244,Was probably fun,"I was enjoying the day with my cousins when we found out that the Water Park beside it was closing--and so was the amusement park itself. They didn't provide any real information, just that they had run out of water to flush the toilets and it would be unsanitary to have a lot of people come in. I'm lucky enough to have been inside the park already and I was able to ride some rides because they started to deny people entry. We had tickets for both the amusement park and the water park but we decided to sweat it out first at the amusement park. My uncle and younger cousins went straight to the water park where they were eventually escorted out and they could not enter the amusement park where the rest of the family was. Legoland started closing rides and restaurants stopped letting patrons in except for the cafe/bakery and it was getting pretty crowded.When we asked the staff, they gave vague answers about the situation and we were told that the water park and everything else would open in ""a few hours"". We were there for only around 3 hours and we were in Johor for a day and burning ""a few hours"" to wait for the parks to be fully operational wasn't really part of our itinerary. I wish they handled it better. I enjoyed most of what I saw but I don't see myself going back anytime soon.",2.0
3245,Overrated,"This place need to be developed . The price is overly rated adults and RM95 for water park and RM75 for kids. It was really dissappointing as the service, opreration method is clearly copied from Singapore's universal studio. The only things is the standard is very low. I'm not sure if the managenment is the same (i don't think so) but i was hoping for better standard based on the marketing for legoland.",2.0
3246,Could do better...,"Went to the water park only in April 2015 with my wife and two kids.  Park itself is badly sign posted from the main road routes and lots of new building construction still going on around the park itself resulting in confused signage and blocked access roads.  Car park looks half-finished - loose bricks, overgrown lots, barriers not fully operational (car parking is not free by the way).  Signage doesn't improve at the park entrance.  We queued for twenty minutes (with very little shade) whilst the staff on the ticket turnstile struggled to 'check in' a party of 8 just ahead of us - it looked like they had pre-booked their tickets and had print outs, which seemed to have caused they turnstile staff some problems.  When we got to the turnstile, they guy mumbled and waved vaguely - we worked out that he was telling us the water park had a different entrance gate.  In LEGOLAND's defence, there was (one) sign, but it was posted to the fence about 50 yards further up, past the main entrance gate and near to the hotel. Of course, for first time visitors, there was no way seeing or knowing this without passing the 'main' gate first.   Once we got to the water park entrance, staff seemed generally unsure and misinformed.  Getting towels and a locker where a bit of a comedy.  Booth staff informed me that I could rent towels for RM30 + RM30 deposit each. By the way, the website says RM20.  I was also told I could buy towels in the shop for RM25 (??).  Anyway, went to buy some towels (since it was cheaper than renting) but could only get bath towels for RM38 each.  Bought 4 of them anyway as I couldn't be bothered to go back and point this out to the booth staff and, for an extra RM8 each, I get to keep them.  Back to the changing room and everyone is struggling with the electronic locker booking machine - the machine doesn't give change so I asked the changing room staff if there was a change machine - they sent me back into the shop - I asked the girl on the till and she asked someone else (looked like the supervisor) who was wandering around with a bag of RM10 notes (apparently, for the lockers) - so finally managed change my RM50 note to get RM40 for the locker (which, to be honest, I felt this should be free - just having spent nearly RM500 on the entrance, RM10 for the car park and RM152 on towels). A far more efficient way of ripping punters off would be to get a change machine or better still, modify the locker booking machine to give change. Once in the park, slides looked impressive but again, signage was poor - one or two of the slides require a dinghy or rubber ring - which we only found out once we had climbed to the top of the slide!  On the first slide (without the aid of a rubber ring) all four of us got stuck...I guess, either not enough water or not quite steep enough.  The dinghy/rubber ring slides were much better (i.e. we managed to get all the way down without getting 'stuck') but the tallest of these require you to carry a four person dinghy up to the top of the slide.  There was a conveyor lift for dinghy's on the other, lower, water slide so I'm guessing it was a cost saving exercise when the park was built.  I managed not to have a heart attack carrying the dinghy up the stairs, although I did notice quite a few people (especially kids) bravely struggling.  Overall, there wasn't enough shade provided in the park (unless, of course, you wanted to shell out another RM300 for a Cabana).  The food stall was over priced (as you would normally expect in Theme Parks) but the choice was very limited - mainly fried food - and the food quality was also quite poor. I would probably have suggested you take a packed lunch with you and keep it in your RM40 locker, but we had some fruit in a bag in our locker for a couple of hours which somehow the ants managed to find.  I seriously think this could be a good place to take your kids but there are issues that are definitely indicative of having rushed the opening of the park and, now that it is open, these issues are not being addressed properly in favour of keeping the gates open.",3.0
3247,good for kids,"As the name suggests, majority is made of lego. We went there on a weekday(Thursday) and there were only few people.  Upon entry, they advised combo holders(waterpark and theme park) to go with the water park first since it is expected to rain in the afternoon.  There are a lot of food options inside the park.  We enjoyed the Lego friends show and other attractions.  During the visit, there are still some attractions under construction.  Bring umbrellas with you to stroll the entire park.",3.0

3249,legoland rocks,"We took a cab to Legoland which was about 30 minutes from our hotel , Pulai Springs Resort. We went on Easter Sunday, I purchased the tickets online 7 days in advance and received a 20pc discount. We did not go to the Waterpark. Legoland itself was perfect for our Family, boys aged 4 and 8. We went on nearly all the rides and did not have to queue for any of them. The boys loved them all. We enjoyed walking around miniland and going on the rides as a family. We had lunch in the main resturant. It was really good, childrens meals came with fruit and a ribeana. I would recommend the kids mac and cheese, yummy. we went to see the Lego Friends live show, I was not impressed, maybe if you had children into Lego Friends it might be better. Next month the show changes to Lego Starwars. Husband was disappointed not to be able to get specialist minifigures there. The children and husband also loved the Starwars indoor expo. Uf we were ever back in the area again we would definitely come back for a second visit.",5.0
3250,Unforgettable day out for kids,"My kids absolutely loved the place, yes it is a little hot (esp in March) so take a brolly and some sun cream.

Though the lego bricks were very nicely done with all new attractions star wars, it wasn't worth the money. Its is overcharged and you cant help but feel..thats it? no more things to see? The park is small. I went on an off peak period and took the same ride few times. Pcitures snapped are overpriced, so is the freaking ugly food and water. Medini mall which is before the Legoland serves better food.I loved Universal studio Singapore and that is worth every single penny spent. Not Legoland.There is a water park which closes early. Don't bother swimming there if you have been to Water Bom bali. Even  Sunway lagoon is way better.",2.0

3258,Recommended - Great value,"A group of 21 of us visited LL Malaysia in February. It was after Chinese NY and the park was quiet with there being very few queues for rides. The park and amenities are presented very well, very clean and tidy, and the staff are polite and friendly. Our group stayed at the LL hotel and again it was very neat with friendly staff. The themed rooms are excellent, and the Lego features in the foyer add to the experience. Our kids loved being greeted by the Lego characters when we arrived. We were also fortunate to be greeted by the Manager who made us feel very welcome on our arrival. I've recommended LL to quite a few friends already. I recommend that anyone going to Singapore and doing Universal studios, add two more days and combine it with a trip to LL Malaysia which provides very good value for families ($150 round trip for minivan).",4.0
3259,Shortage of Water Supply,"Legoland Malaysia is announcing the closure of the entire park, due to shortage of water supply.

3275,Full day of family fun,"Visited with two sons (10 and 8) and they absolutely loved it. Noted the comments here about the lack of shade but we found plenty of places around the park to take five out of the sun. Arrived on a weekday as the park opened at 10 and went straight in, in fact there were no queues for any of the rides. Staff were friendly and professional, yes food was a little pricey but you'd expect that in a theme park. Loved the Star Wars section, fantastic attention to detail there. You can easily spend a full day here as we did. The only thing holding me back from giving it 5 stars is that the big castle and main rollercoaster ride was closed the day we visited - kids were a little disappointed there and maintenance should really be scheduled when the park is closed.Visited the water park the following day and this is where you will suffer from the sun if not protected. Also found it a little odd that essentials in a water park such as towels and lockers incurred extra charges, these should really be included.",4.0
3276,A lot to really like here,"With some friends and their children this was one place we were keen to visit.Travelling from Penang to here via AirAsia and then a reasonably quick trip via taxi to the Legoland Resort (which I will review later) was flawless.Upon arrival the excitement and fun began in the positive sense. Staff were welcoming and genuinely keen to make you comfortable and wanted here and nothing was to hard for them to do! A nice change from the usual Malaysia la!!The Park is amazing, so much to do and see and fun! Yes it's hot and it can rain, shade is a premium as the park is pretty new. It may rain, bring a poncho, and heaps of water. Everything costs here.... Don't be surprised. Yes, it's expensive, no surprise there, weather is unpredictable too, but my gosh we had fun! Who wants for a moment to be that kid again at Legoland??Can't wait till tomorrow.",5.0

Activities and staff are wonderful, friendly and thoroughly enjoy their work which is so encouraging. Weather is unpredictable, bring wet weather gear, plenty of water and be aware shade is a premium. It is a relatively new park so trees are still young. Even as an adult I've had a blast and my kids and friends children have had a ball!

Considering that in Malaysia it rains 50% of the days, dont go there to gamble your money on good weather. The house always wins and you will probably loose your money and your day.

The staff at the counter did not even speak good english. It took a while after 10 o clock for them to start selling water park tickets . The staff that were managing the rides were helpful enough though. Overall, the rides could be way better.",3.0
3285,Great,"We went there at ~11:30 a.m. There was a queue to buy tickets but we skipped it as we had booked the tickets online (which I highly recommend). We went to the ""Miniland"" first but it was too hot so we decided to go somewhere else first. If you are going to the ""Dino Land"" water-ride, I recommend buy a poncho if you are traveling alone as it would be more cost-effective, however, if you are in a group, using the ""body dryer"" after the ride would be more cost-effective (you will be soaked through). The queue times were under 5 minutes everywhere even though it was a Saturday. The 4D shows are worth a miss as it is quite uneventful. Their toilets are very very clean.",5.0
3286,Good for kids,"went to both parks .. dry and water .. no waiting time .. overall great fun. Food at the Legoland park is better than at the Waterpark. Nothing else around, shopping mall is none existent .. Hotel is great",5.0
3287,Fantastic for Kids!,"It is one of the upscale theme parks that the country has to offer. Having said that, it has lived-up to my family and my expectation of the facilities and services that was available and rendered during our recent school holiday visit. I firmly believed that Legoland Malaysia was even as par if not better than some of the other great theme parks across Asia. It had exciting and ample of measurable water slides (that caters to all levels) which could even reach the excitement experience standards if compared with the Tower of Poseidon of Aquaventure Waterpark at the The Palm Jumeirah in Dubai, I would say. The Legoland theme park itself was great and astonishing from plane rides (be a pilot), driving school (with road safety & rules), thrilling roller-coasters (you may want to try out the apprentice roller-coaster first if you are a beginner), Starwars and many more. On the other hand, the finer detail of available facilities had met my expectation eg. baby strollers that could be rented at very reasonable rates, a safe locker (with electronic safety bar codes) that could be rented at the locker room entrance, and surprisingly clean changing / shower rooms which comes with a complimentary shower gel amenity. You will find a fair number of F&B outlets scattered all over the park for quick finger bites or to simply quench your thirst on a very hot sunny day. I just felt that certain prices of the food and beverages were slightly expensive eg. RM20.00 for a Burger. The entry prices to Legoland Malaysia will depend entirely on your choice of park(s) that you may wish to visit which had an option of Water Park, Theme Park or both. You might want to opt for the Combo Package (Water & Theme Park) should you are a first timer and especially with kids. It will be slightly expensive but it is worth the eye opener experience. Just be mindful that there would be 3rd party agents / individuals that will be trying to get a hook out of you by selling slightly cheaper admission tickets which they work within the Legoland entrance complex itself. So be a smart buyer. If you grew up with Lego during your childhood days, this is the place that you should be to catch-up with all the missing edition of your Lego collections. You would be spoil for choices! You will also find a Medini Mall that is located within the proximity of the park that serves as a shopping avenue to all visitors alike. Taxi charges may vary from time to time but expect a rate between RM45 - RM50 should you are hopping to and fro of JB city. It is a great place to be for family and friends. No harm and give it a try!",4.0
3288,Hot but fun for kids.,"New place means new trees means less shades. Wear a sun block. If you are travelling with small kids/babies, bring extra fans & batteries. The rides there are more to kiddies ride.",4.0
3289,""" best place for the kids during school breaks and weekends ""","I bought the season pass during the Matta Fair months before the actual opening of the theme park and what a bargain it turn out to be ! It is a must for parents to bring the kids to visit the park during holidays at least once, more so if you are residing in Malaysia. It offers many different themed experiences and the kids are definitely going to enjoy it,  what more with the opening of the Water themed park in 2014. However just be weary of the heat during the hot season as it can be really wearing down on kids. The 4D cinema is a must for all to visit and enjoy whilst there .",4.0
3290,Great place for all ages,"Easy to get there. The park is gigantic. The water park is bigger than I imagined. Legoland Malaysia has a lot of rides, shows and attractions. It is a must go for family and kids.The toilets at the water park are also massive. Its not the usual type of toilets you see at normal swimming pool sites. The toilets have soap provided when you are bathing so that you do not need to worry if you forgot to bring you soap.",5.0
3291,Kids enjoyment,"My kids (6 & 4 y.o) like it. Been there twice already, and they've been demanding for a revisit. Only drawback is the lack of greens (or trees), which make the atmosphere in the property amazingly blazing HOT, so dry. Bring umbrellas and sun-tan, cover yourself & the kids obviously. Food & drinks are quite cheap considering a theme-park (compared to USS).",4.0

3293,the most amazing park,so far the very best park we went. it is HUGE. we took a two day pass. one day for legoland and next day for the legoland water park. a must visit.,5.0
3294,Great for young kids,"Kids from 5-12 can enjoy this place at their fullest since they can enjoy almost most of the rides.But yeah like many other said, it was scorching hot but hey, just get prepared and enjoy!",5.0
3295,A bit underwhelming for adults,"I had high expectations for the park, but left a little bit disappointed. Don't get me wrong, it's great, especially for kids. But for adults, it felt kinda underwhelming. Even the Star Wars display weren't that great. I went there on Sunday during the start of a school holidays and the Q's for the rides were mostly less than 5 minutes long, which is a great plus! Heck, I Q'd longer to get the park entrance tix.We only went for the theme park and didn't go to the water park. Overall, I'd say a one day visit is sufficient to cover the whole theme park itself. The park is not that big and the Q for the rides weren't long. The park can be a bit hot as there's not a lot of tall trees to provide shades. They do provide lots of covered rest areas though.Food inside the park can be a bit pricey. Bottled carbonated drinks goes for about RM5 and food ranges from around RM18 - 30. So be prepared to spend, or else sneak in your own rations. lolMost rides appeals more to children. As far as I can remember, there's only 1 roller coaster ride that's considered more suitable for adults. On average, the child needs to be taller than 1 meter and older than 4 y/o to go on most of the rides. There's a few rides which allows kids taller than 90cm and below 3 y/o to go on it, but it is very limited. I guess that's why kids below 3 y/o  gets in for free.Overall, I'd say that there's still room for improvement. I went there thinking that I HAD to get the annual pass, but ends up glad that I didn't splurge on it.",3.0
3296,not worth the price,very childish and nothing compared to universal studios or disneyland.... not many rides for adults and most of them are for ages upto 15yrs.. exhibits are very less in number compared to the price charge RM 155/pax... kids might enjoy but adults need to think twice before going...,4.0
3297,Great amusement park for kids,I like its thematic park which gives learning while playing for children. We came during weekdays so it was not crowded and therefore quite ease for us to enjoy all the rides.,4.0

Hmmm.... i rather say, not there yet...Overall, first theme park in JB, worth the visit",3.0
3299,Not that cool as it looks...,"I went there and got really disappointed. The park is just for kids between 3 to 8 year old... If you are not in that ages anymore, you don't have nothing to do there. The place is really small and has limited spaces to stay if you want to run away from the sun and the hot weather.The Lego monuments are pretty impressive for the first sight but they are clearly old and dirty.The stores says that they have a huge varieties of Lego stuff, but I don't think they were that impressive.I don't recommend it at all!",1.0
3300,Excellent!!,"Been to Lego Land with my wife and 2 teenagers was awesome. The rides are not that extreme comparing to other venues locally with in Malaysia.The souvenirs sold are bit steep. Maybe all imported items. However, the quality is there.Plenty of food varieties. Delicious and price, can't say much.. The only process to look into is to have an access pass for both wet and dry parks like a wrist band or stamp as troublesome to carry the tickets portion everywhere.Anyhow, worth to spend time here at the Legoland Malaysia. I will definitely come back!!",5.0
3301,brought out the kid in me,"i love lego when I was a kid so when we went here, I was so thrilled. A whole theme park was made out of lego. The theme park was great. The only downside is there is very little shady areas so it is scorching hot!!! But still the place is beautiful.",4.0
3302,Good for young kids who are into lego,"We travelled to Legoland from Singapore Flyer on the bus, the travel time there took 2.5 hours as there were delays at departure in Singapore and Customs in Malaysia....so quite a mission getting on and off the bus for 2 stops. My 7 year old loved Legoland as the rides were all catered for this age group and younger. My 11 year old thought it was ok....a bit boring for her though. It would have been a bit better with more shade as it was a hot day. The rides are a bit average and poorly made so I didn't feel very safe on the roller coaster and the Dino Island ride. We also had water park passes. We spent about 30mins there as the water looked icky and I stood on something slimy in the lazy river which totally put me off! Lego was cheap compared to Australia and lots to choose from. Glad we went, but won't be coming back.",3.0

3305,Kid's favourites,"Not many tourists went to the Legoland since it is a bit far away from Singapore. We booked the ticket via official website and got and took the shuttle where near Singapore flyer.The Legoland is not very large. Because not many tourists, we could play slowly and played every games without spending too much time on queuing. The Dragon Ride in a 'fake' castle is the best games. So far i can see from other kids, they were really enjoy it. And for people like us is a bit too old...The Lego in this Legoland is not cheaper than Hong Kong. But those key rings or little lego-man are some good souvenirs . Beware the hot weather, as most of the area are open area.",3.0

3308,Baby land,"Their rides are rather mild. Not for adrenaline junkies, I'm afraid. Go on good weather days as there are not much shade provided and the area can get quite hot as it is pretty bare. The water park is a bit small. A bit overpriced for the number of rides and activities present.",3.0
3309,Knowledge mixed with leisure,"A wonderful place and the first lego based theme park in asia. Johor Bahru is a good location and can be reached from Singapore (It takes about an hour from singapore to crossover to Johor Bahru and then about 35 minutes to legoland and the best part is you can plan this trip using public transport. Though a planned tour is preferred as it is cost effective. JB can also be reached from Kuala Lumpur by flight or by Bus( it takes about 7-8 hours).Its a wonderful amusement park and everything is constructed as if made from lego blocks. The toy train, the boats everything.The best part is the Lego Mini City, where all the architectural wonders of the world are showcased, including our very own tajmahal ( with a film shooting model also) The model of Angkor Vat was breathtaking, so was the twin towers. Makes for a nice photo op. The restaurants inside though few offers a very good and tasty food. We had a wonderful day. Only one thing which is bad is all the rides are not suitable for children below 2.5 feet. Visited 2 years back, when it had just opened.",5.0
3310,A happy place to visit,"We visited Legoland with our 3 year old daughter. We arrived on a friday,checked in the resorts' hotel and explored the parks for one whole day.The park opened at 10 a.m.We went there on a Saturday, but the crowd is not that big. We opted to experience the water park first. There are a lot rides and there was even one of the slides where my 3 year old tot is allowed to ride with us.It was  really hot so better  put on a lot of sunscreen. There are lifeguards everywhere so you don't have to worry about safety. The food was okey. We stayed there until 2 p.m. and went to the theme park right after. We stayed at the theme park until 5 p.m. You'll just need 2-3 hours to ride everything in the theme park. the time we have left was for taking pictures of those amazing Malaysian landmarks made of lego bricks. You only need a day for both parks but be sure to be there as soon as the park  opens because the kids would want to stay at the waterpark longer. They also have lockers and strollers for rent. We made a wise decision booking at the legoland hotel. We enjoyed our stay and would definitely come back.",4.0
3311,Not worth it,The theme park mostly its for kids!The money that we pay not worth it.There is no more smoking area for the smoker like last year.The water park been separately from theme park.Its difficult to people.There is not much choice of food in there.,1.0
3312,A haven for kids and kids-at-heart,"You need a whole day to explore and try out as many features of the park. The rides were fun, lines weren't very long, even if we went on a holiday. The kids enjoyed most of the attractions, the rides for the adults. As a mom of a one-year-old boy, I really appreciate their Baby Care Center where mom and kid can breastfeed, change, rest, and even nap. The park was not too huge nor too small to explore. There are so many things to do no matter your age. Only concern is the weather. Good to come on a not so hot day.",4.0
3313,So much fun and perfect for my 6 & 4 year old.,"We did a day trip to Legoland from Singapore and it was so much fun.  The rides were almost all geared towards kids 12 and under.  There was a building area and race track to test your design.  There were areas for kids under 4 as well.  The middle of the week wasn't busy and there were almost no lines for any rides.  It took us about 1 1/2 hours from our hotel in Singapore to the park.  We had a private car and the border was easy.  The park will take Singapore dollars at a fair rate of exchange but you will get Ringgit as change.  There are a few food options inside, some are indoor so choose your spot if its hot and you want AC.  The displays were really neat and I used my selfie stick to create some cool forced perspective shots that made the buildings seem life sized.  We were lucky to see the Star Wars exhibit and it was amazing.  I bought tickets online ahead of time and saved some money so plan well.  They have a stroller rental (one kid or two kid options) so you can leave yours at home if that's easier.  I might have stayed at the hotel if I had known about it, it looked really fun.",5.0
3314,For Lego Fans Only,"Being the mother of 2 Lego freaks, I had no choice but to bring my family to the only  Legoland in Asia. The kids obviously had the time of their lives. But us parents were disappointed. We went Feb. 22, 2015. It was super hot. There was barely any trees inside the park. You really need sunblock and umbrellas. Coming from Singapore, we crossed the border to Malaysia.There was no money exchange booths available. Good thing Legoland accepts Singapore dollars. Legoland is for Lego fanatics. Pure and simple.",3.0
3315,Better than expected,"This place gets a bad rap by many reviewers. The main themes seem to be (1) not enough shelter and (2) too childish.On the first count, yes, more shelter would be great. But do you realistically expect the whole place to be blanketed in shades? There are plenty of rest stops at rides, attractions, stores, booths and rest areas where you can catch a break. And they are all well positioned. The very fact it is in the tropics should give you a hint that ‚Äì maybe ‚Äì you should, as a visitor, expect tropical conditions. I do concede more shading around Miniland would make it a better experience, however. This is a place where you tend to linger after all. The second complaint seems to come from AFOL who are shocked that a kid‚Äôs theme park is designed for kids. The closer your kids get to 10 the more bored they will be, but for a 4 year old and any kid up to 8 ‚Äì this place is a dream come true. The rides cover all age groups from the sedate boat and car rides to the more adventurous roller coasters that get a bit of speed behind them. I got a Lego ‚Äòdrivers licence‚Äô 30 years ago in Denmark and was glad to see they still do it. More adult activities like the fire station challenge would be good.  Miniland was great and the Asian theme was obvious and appreciated. Bit more effort could have gone into the Vietnam scene though. Like any outdoor attraction, the heat and rain will wear down the exhibits and it could do with more frequent renewal. The staff were helpful all the way through and every single one of them happy to trade Minifigs with us. Our son loved this aspect.Food-wise, compared to anything we‚Äôd get at an Australia event or theme park the quality selection and price were terrific. Outside the park main entry is a mini mall area that has convenience stores, international fast food joints and restaurants making it easy to fill up at the end of the day or at lunch if you have a multi pass ticket. Plenty of Lego stores throughout the park ‚Äì although more rare and hard to get items would have made me part with more cash. Making your own minifigs was heaps fun.  We stayed at the Legoland hotel so it was a five minute walk from our room to the park. Highly recommend that option. The water park next door deserves a mention (awesome) and gets its own review. All up, Legoland was a massive hit for our family. It was a total immersive experience. We spread it out over two days, easy to do for with overnight stay. We went mid-week so the crowds were very manageable. Bundled ticket prices were extremely competitive.",5.0
3316,excellent for little kids,"my kid is 3 years old. he truly enjoys going to legoland. plenty of rides for small kids. their staffs are friendly and helpful. toilets are super clean. but i find the place hot in the afternoon. food are ridiculously expensive and parking is far. but my kid loves it. oh well, things we do for our kids..",5.0
3317,Facilities breaking up,"Hurry and buy your tickets asap. When raining, you will be blessed with water as there is no overhead shelters and leakages are everywhere. Go now before the covers are blown away by the wind.",1.0
3318,Fun & Hot!,"Best time to go is during the week if you can or low season. There are no queues or if there is, then it's very short and goes fast. You then can go on your favourite rides as often as you want. It's also easier to get a table for lunch. Easier to find shade - and you will need it, because it gets very hot and hardly any wind and there are limited shade or seats available so if it's a busy day it's difficult to get one under a tree or awning.For lunch go to the one next to the Burger Junction at Land of Adventure - good food, good ambience and better than being in an enclosed busy and tight food outlet. Just watch out for the big crows that will aggressively try to steal your leftovers.The rides and entertainment were good but don't expect anything dramatically exciting like those offered at Disneyland or Universal Studios. The service and features are average - there's a lack of practical details like water fountains every few metres so guests can rehydrate themselves; the staff are placid and are like walking zombies, the mascots are un-energetic - and I would be too if I had to walk around in the heat with those heavy suits on.Somewhat unprofessional at a few attractions - for example, so many people were waiting outside the 4D film theatre for at least 20min only for the staff to cancel the show 5min late into the due time.Height Restrictions: This is the only theme park we've been to (and we have been to a lot all around the world, Disneyland, Universal, Six Flags etc.) that has an unusual height restrictions where they measure not only height but age too. So basically you need to satisfy both criteria - so even though your child fits the correct height, if they are under 4yrs old then they can not ride at all. Quite disappointed I must say.Best rides/attractions - The Dragon at lego Kingdoms, Lego Mindstorms @ Lego Technic, Beetle Bounce & Lost Kingdom Adventure @ Land of AdventureBest shows at Lego Studios - A clutch Powers & Spellbreaker. For kiddies: Lego City.New Attraction: Star Wars is an excellent display of Lego and good marketing ploy for entice guests to buy the Star Wars Lego series.Waterpark - go for the slides! They're so much fun!  The wave pool was also great. Don't miss the Waterpark if you can fit it in your stay.Overall, we still had a great time and despite a few flaws. The amount of detail that went into creating the park with lego parts is amazing.  The key that made our trip more comfortable and enjoyable was the fact that the park was quiet & not crowded.",3.0
3319,Waste of time and money,"We came with 2 young children. This place is nothing special. Certainly not what I expected for a Theme park with the Lego brand (or any theme park for that matter). The place is for the most part fully exposed by the sun with little or no shade, which in my opinion is not ideal for young children (even though Lego claims that's what the park is for). That is a little bit silly since its in Malaysia where its summer all year round. Also, what if it suddenly started raining? Staff at the entrance / exit are unfriendly and unprofessional, could not even get a smile out of them. The park itself is poorly built, and looks like it was hastily put together by amateurs. Some of what they have in the park does not even have a lego theme to it, e.g. the playground areas (which by the way is no different from the free playgrounds available all over Singapore). The rides and attractions look neglected. Some of the food and drink stations were closed; why would it be closed on a Saturday?! To top it off, the park is quite small and for what is offered, too expensive. If you are visiting from Singapore, then you have to factor in travelling there, clearing customs, etc. Its just not worth it. If you are reading this, please spend your money elsewhere. Even if you really want to cross the border, then please go to Hello Kitty Town or Little Big Club; at least those places are sheltered / air-conditioned. One more thing, if you are purchasing the discounted tickets in advance, please note that those tickets are a ONE TIME entry and once you step out of the park you cannot go back in. We checked on our way out and even though we were not going back in anyway, we just thought that was silly.",1.0
3320,Could do better...,"As a big Lego fan, i was naturally thrilled to go to Legoland. Visited it alone (so that i can manage my own time better) and the overall experience was pleasant. Honestly, it could be better.Once I got there, it was obvious that it was designed for kids. I didn't go on any rides as they targeted towards children aged between 6 to 14. All i did was to walk around and sight see. There are a lot of nice details and touches. I especially liked the 'Mini World'  which focused on Asian cities. The details there were impressive and I believed I spent over an hour in that area alone. You really will need to look closely at the display to really appreciate the work that went into it.I was disappointed with the Lego sets that the shops within the theme park sold. Unfortunately, there weren't much 'collectible sets' apart from those that will appeal to the younger crowds. Also noticed that there aren't much sheltered walkways. Hence, I will suggest bringing an umbrella and wear sunblock.I believe that the theme park could do more to attract the adults since most of us grew up with Lego, one time or the other.",3.0
3321,"Tiring, but a good one!","- Recommended to go on weekdays as the line will be shorter for each games. Come in early morning as it can get scorching hot at noon!- You may need to spend the whole day here as the area is very huge. You probably will stay there until night if you bought waterpark access too. - Most games are for children and the choice is very limited for the adults. However it was fun to take lots of picture! - Fret not, they have cafes, souvenir shops, lockers and even ATM to take care of your needs. - It is quite far to walk from parking lots to the main entrance. Brace yourself. If you're feeling a bit luxurious, you may stay at Legoland Hotel, which is closer to the entrance. - There's a public transport (bus) you can take to go to Legoland.

As adults, we were expecting the place will be enjoyable only for our little toddlers. We were proven wrong! There were rides for adults and kids alike!  The Starwars and Mini City were truly awesome! Whoever created such masterpieces have brilliant minds!  Our 3 year old grandson and grand daughter learned to ""drive"" using those cute little cars - it was both a memorable and an achievement for them!We arrived as the park opened at 10 am.  Buying our tickets online at the Legoland website was an advantage.. not only did it save us money (20% discount) but it was a breeze entering the park, no more long lines to purchase tickets.  We rode thrill rides! Our faces were caught in cameras and photos but the price was just too much at MYR50 each photo!  Had they offered it at much affordable price, many of the riders would readily buy them.  Hope they reconsider this.  Drinks and snacks abound, restaurants offered food for both adults and kids alike.  Facilities like toilets were always clean.  My daughter who was breastfeeding loved the Baby care center. They thought of babies too!  There was a place called Build test where our toddlers could work on their own Lego pieces.  Even Daddies and Mommies could try their skills here!Time flew so fast, it was time to go home at 6pm.  We were tired for sure but our hearts were filled with happy and unforgettable moments..

However most things there are really overpriced even by 'tourist-attraction' places standard.Tips:-Bring a hat, and wear a lot of sunscreen as it is really really hot in there. Bring bottles of water to keep yourself hydrated.If you are going to both Dry and Wet Park I suggest to go to the Wet Park first, in case it rains during the evening.If you want to eat outside (there's a strip of eateries in front of the legoland entrance) try the Old Town Kopitiam (at the end).Avoid  KFC at all cost, we had the misfortune of having lunch there only to end up throwing most of it away as it was really bad.",4.0

3334,Fun place for family recreation,"A trip to Legoland with a bus from JB Sentral around 8:30 am and took about 40 minutes.From the bus stop had to walk about 500 meters, quite tiring for my children aged 5 years. But pretty shady because there canopy although the weather was sunny and hot.After arriving at the entrance, ticket clerk informed us that prior to the Water Park because if later the weather is cloudy, Water Park will be closed. Very helpful recommendations from the staff.Water Park is very fun because complete the following types of swimming pool with Lego cube-shaped buoysThe rest of the time we used to play in Legoland, very clean, friendly staff, rides were varied and good place to eat.A fun place for a family vacation.",4.0

3336,For Lego lovers,"The difference with other amusement parks is; they have many figures and miniaturs of famous buildings, build from lego so it must be wonderful for lego lovers.. but not for others. I was advised to come not in public holidays and weekends (because it will be very crowded and not comfortable at all and there will be long lines to all attractions). So we came in Tuesday and there were no lines and everything is clean. Bring umbrella, hat as it's an outdoor one and it can be very hot while we need to walk around between places.",3.0
3337,"Bring Umbrellas, Suitable for kids 5yrs and Above","As it is an open place, please be advised to always bring an umbrella. Presentation of the attractions were good and there were many places where kids can play.My advice is to bring your own drinks or buy them from outside. The merchandise sold are quite expensive and if you need to stay for the day, please get a hotel near the theme park and not stay in the Legoland hotel as it is not value for money.I find that kids of a certain age might enjoy this place but not the younger ones.Enjoy and have a safe trip everyone!",3.0
3338,young again,"I went to Legoland from Singapore by taking a tourist bus near Kallang station. Usually, leave at 9am and return at 5pm. You have the option to just pay the transpo or both transpo and Legoland day-pass.",5.0
3339,Keep Your Expectations LOW !,"It's a small park with minimal - yes - FEW rides. That aside, I think Malaysia didn't have the ""budget"" necessary to invest in a project like this. Everything is done to the minimal ... meaning - the washrooms use the cheapest (I can't think of another word to express the situation) hand driers. And they pride themselves when they have an attraction ""room"" filled with air conditioning. And let's just say ---  that ""attraction"" wasn't even a ride. I was tricked inside, thinking it was a ""ride"". But, it was just a ROOM with a screen in the front, where you will stand (sit if you are lucky enough because there's only a few seats) to watch a loooong + booooring animation. What's the point of it? I don't know. But I was anticipating the ride that will follow after the ""introduction"". However, there was no ride afterwards. When the doors opened, I ran to the door to find out in front of me were just random lego displays (exhibitions) & a shop then an exit. Where's the RIDE?!!! Where's my RIDE?!! anyways, that was the Star Wars attraction (I forgot the exact ""name"" of the attraction)Because I'm a scardy cat, I don't really ""do"" rides EXCEPT for those 3D simulator things. (Like, you know - in Universal Studios Florida, where they have the Terminator ""ride"" or like ... the old ""Back to the Future"" ride). So, when I went in to their 4D theatre / attraction, I was expecting the same effects. To my disappointment, the theatre's seats DON'T move. The 3D movie had little 3D effects. The only thing that they have a LOT going on is - spitting water at you. (Like the water that comes down from the ceiling, synchronized with the movie.) They also tried the snow-effect. But, only one side of the theatre got to experience it, because on my side - the machine seems to be broken... Detailed Review Here: wifeybb.blogspot.com/2015/02/valentines-day-2015.html",3.0

User friendly for Muslim and families with children. Clean and air conditioned toilets. Must spend one whole day at each parks (theme and water). Most time spent was at the Build and Test area, where one can build Legos provided and test it.. Many adults even play here (Which was supposed to be for kids). For those with kids, to fully utilised the rides, one must be taller than 100CM. The only setback; some of t he staff manning the rides were not enthusiastic/cheerful. Looks and sounded bored.",4.0

3342,Great family outing for family with young ones,"A place you can fill your little ones with fun & educating activities.Activities are mainly for up to 12 yrs but the teens should find it interesting to visit too. Don't rush your time, you should spend a day to enjoy without overwhelm by the weather.Hat/cab, water, sunblock is recommended.I would suggest Legoland to invest more big & large trees to shed up the themepark to improve the leisure experience.",4.0
3343,Awesome,"We went to the theme park and the waterpark.  I was with my 6 and 11 year old children, my wife and mother-in-law.  We had a great time at the park.  The lines / wait for the rides were minimal and made the entire experience very enjoyable.  Overall I think my kids enjoyed the waterpark the most but the Legoland them park was also great and my son is already talking about going back for more!",5.0
3344,Fun,The reception was welcoming and my boys loved the lego area. The room are clean and comfy. Only thing is feel like the room is small due to the border between the bunk bed and the main bed. It has all the necessary things in the room. Loved the hotel inner decorations. The breakfast buffet was ok nothing fancy or great. Lotsa oily food though. The parking is convenient. Will definitely like to come again. ,4.0
3345,Brick Adventure!,"We weren't able to maximize the theme park attraction.  We weren't able to see everything but given that, we still enjoyed seeing so much about life made of bricks.  We rode the train, saw the miniatures of world attractions (I like the Taj Mahal) and the Star Wars themed section.  We weren't able to ride the roller coasters and water paddling-something ride but me and my older brother decided to go to the Water Park which was also a surefire hit!  We rode so much of the slides and felt like kids in the Build a Brick Raft area where larger floating rubber Lego bricks are waiting to be built with whatever you like.  And yeah!  We loved that giant bucket pouring huge amounts of water on eager tourists like us!  I love this experience!  Too bad, the wave pool was under maintenance.",5.0

3347,"Family attraction, photoshoot lover","Legoland is a place for family where parents can bring their children to look at the man-made lego structure. Kids can also have some lego class which they can learn how to build anything they want with lego. There are four rides in the theme park and all of them are family friendly. They are not that scary as other theme park so basically kids can have some thrilling experience but parents do not have to worry too much about them.For adults, legoland can be described as a place of once in a lifetime. There are many lego made structures which worth a visit and some photo shooting especially the miniland which features many famous landmarks in Malaysia as well as other countries. If not interested in photo shooting or those cute lego structures, there is not much thing you can do in this place. The entrance fee is quite high but you can spend whole day over there if you are truly interested. The food in Legoland are over-priced (RM20 for a burger) so you (Malaysian) better be prepared for the shock. Not many shades can be found in the theme park so sunscreen, umbrella or hat are strongly recommended.",4.0
3348,Fun even for the adults,"I always heard about how hot it is in Legoland reviewed by those who went there. It was a short trip for me and my family. We went to Johor just to go the the Legoland, so we're hoping for great weather. We are so lucky because during our visit, it is not hot at all. It was raining for about half and hour at mid-day, and after that the weather is just fine. We were there the whole day.",4.0
3349,Iconia Asian Landmarks,"we visited Legoland Malaysia from the UK as we are on a mission to visit all the Legolands around the world. The Miniland was the standout feature here, with iconic landmarks from all across Asia. The price was also reasonable (in Legoland terms). in terms of food, there are many themed restaurants althoygh they tend to be expensive for what you get, especially for a place like Malaysia where lovely food is everywhere. There is a small shopping mall before you enter Legoland, And one can find plenty of good food there. The cuisine range from regional to Western including fastfood like KFC which always an option for those who like to play it safe. The Legoland shop itself is well stocked and has everything you would expect by Lego but the prices seemed steep for the locals. like for like conversion to pounds mde them slightly cheaper though. It is definitely one of the top attractions in Malaysia nowadays.",5.0

3351,Legoland is Awesome.... ;-),"We live in Singapore and have been several times with with our two boys, ages 5 and 6. Annual pass is great if you're nearby. The new Star Wars stuff is a blast. We get there before 10, cruise around the park for a few hours, then go to the water park in the afternoon to cool off and have more fun, then grab a bite and drive home. We sometimes use the lockers to check our gear. It takes 5 minutes tops to go between the parks. Lots of restaurant choices in the little strip approaching the park, but eating inside is fine -- not so overpriced as you sometimes see. And for the diehards, their is of course a hotel, which our friends say is nice, though we have yet to feel the need.  ;-)",5.0

We tried the hotel dinner buffet too, it was a fun dining experience for my kid, he loves the candy buffet very much.",5.0
3355,Fun for young ones!,"The theme park and the waterpark are not too big so it makes it relatively easy for young kids to walk. However, a number of the rides in both parks have restrictions on height and it will be better to go when your kids are around 110cm in height in which they can take almost all the rides. The shorter and younger ones will have very limited rides to take though.There have some areas in which you can build legos and models. Good resting stops for parents and kids especially if the weather is very hot.Bring lots of water, sunblock, snacks/bread plus maybe an extra set of clothing for the young ones. Hats and brollies are very important too!Definitely a place that young children will enjoy. ",4.0

3357,Big and colorful park but could do with more shades ,"Went for our maiden legoland trip on a Sunday ( we stayed at legoland hotel just next to the theme park). Was worried there would be a huge crowd but glad it was not so. There's only about 5 mins queue for most of the rides. Had to wait about 15 minutes for the express train ride but it was ok as we waited in the train station so it was not too hot. It's a good idea to use lotsa sunblock lotion, shades and a hat on. The park could do with more trees to soften the heat. There were a few restaurants and food kiosk around so good is not a problem. But if you can wait, the restaurants outside the park were better with more choices. It's a great park for young children ( they are not too difficult to please). ",4.0
3358,Dont get high expectations.,"Visited here recently on a Thursday....had high expectations of this place as i am a huge Lego fan..The first painful part was that if you were traveling from Singapore through to theme park you had to attend the bus company WTS travel located at the Singapore flyer and purchase tickets as you can not book online or pay by credit-card over the phone in advance.Second is that the trip itself took 2 hours to arrive to the final destination due to customs and immigration stops, although this part of the trip was expected.The only highlight of the trip was the Star Wars exhibition. If it hadn't been for this, the whole trip would have been a waste of time. The entrance fee is not worth it. There were no shows, performances etccc like you would expect at Disneyland or Singapore  universal studios, so dont go here if you have high expectations of the place. Place was empty with a handful of rude school children from China or where ever they came from running around..Not enough rides for adults and is aimed at small children.Will not recommend to anyone, spend your money and go see Universal Studios Singapore if staying in Singapore.That's all",2.0
3359,That was right HOT,"Yes !! Most of the place was built from lego, many miniature, many characters from lego too,intense rides, non-intense-rides.

3360,Fun But Hot,"Legoland is purely for kids between ages below 10 only. So for teenagers, it is just a waste of time. There were not many shady trees or rest spots with a roof. They should plant more trees and plants and also water spray installed to make the place cooler. Overall it was disappointing unless if you have small kids. Or else don't waste your money going there... unless the Legoland decide to install some adult rides.For teens and adults... it is a boring place where you have to pay huge sum to visit.",2.0
3361,"Very good for people who love lego, average for others",There are lots and lots of things to see but the park is pretty remote. If you're not into lego and are just looking for a theme park and water park this is NOT the park for you. We were expecting much more intense rides but note:The park is aimed at little kids/minors not teens and adults (except maybe the robotics programming idk)Nice attractions to see and both parks are pretty good. Water > Theme imo.,3.0
3362,Kids loved it,"Legoland is the ultimate place to visit if you are into lego. Our kids loved it!  There is plenty of rides, shows and activities to fill the whole day.  Amazing lego displays throughout the park.  It was not too busy the day we visited and the longest wait was approx 20mins.  Recommend packing hats and sunscreen.  We bought family combo tickets that included a day at the waterpark and 3 nights at Legoland hotel which was cheaper than booking individually.  Overall a great experience certain to please any Lego fan.",5.0
3363,What a fun place,"if you really a lego lover, you must visit this place.overall, it's fun and i enjoyed to visit this place. but as i read many reviews, most are saying that this place is suitable for kids not adults. so, i'm kind of agree with that and lil bit overrated to who says this place is superb. most attractions are not so extreme compare to universal studio. many activities are also for kids, like build the lego. not so big, so 3,5 hours is enough to explore the whole theme park. most interesting part is the miniatures of tourism places from many countries. don't forget to take picture on that area. bring your sun protection, because it's very hot. during my visit, legoland wasn't so crowded. so, i didn't have to queue for a long time..for their restaurant, i ate pizza on their pizza and pasta restaurant. they sell family package. if you travel with many people on a thigh budget, just try their pizza and pasta restaurant. to reach this place, i rode a causewaylink bus from JB central. the bus code is LM1. it's only RM4,5/way.",4.0
3364,Great themepark,"The size and layout of the themepark is easy to navigate. Restaurants and restrooms are plenty. They even built playgrounds for little tots who are too small for the rides.

3366,Great place for family,This theme park is for all ages. I visited last Sunday with friends and there was no queue. Maybe it is still early of the year so not many crowds yet.

A lot of attractions for kids too.This theme park is beautiful with lot of shades and greenery. It is a great place for family!,5.0
3367,Not just another Themepark,"My kids were asking me to visit this place, first because it's a themepark second, because of LEGO brand on it. They were curious about theme park that built based on LEGO brick and character. But we found that LEGOLAND give us more than just another themepark. Kids have a chance to learn how to build a cars and buildings from LEGO bricks. And also here we can see many landmarks from Asian countries that built from LEGO bricks, so amazing.",4.0
3368,Excellent theme park,Great theme park for all ages. We visited during weekdays and avoided the queues.

As all the Malaysian and Singapore kids were back in school it was a really quiet day and we didn't have to line up for anything. The shops were great at the end. The new star wars Lego display was amazing and detailed.

At this point, you might want to visit the waterpark to cool down.Great for all Lego fans, young and old, especially the Star Wars display which was impressive.

3383,Good theme park for your kids,Facility and games in this park are very suitable for kid older than 4 years old. But don't expect games for adult in this park.,4.0
3384,Legoland is great for kids and the adults who still have a kid's heart,Took the 7 year old and 5 year old to Malaysia Legoland and enjoyed it immensely. The park opens at 9.00am but many or the attractions are not open until 10.00am. The park has lots of roller coaster/fun rides for different ages and some very good Lego models. The Star Wats exhibition is excellent.We also went to the Lego waterpark which was excellent. The Lifeguards are very professional and good with kids and the various rides are some of the best I have been on. It is best to do the main park in the morning and the water park in the afternoon when it is hotter. Leave your watches in the lockers as they don't let you wear watches on the water slides for safety reasons. There must have been an incident in the past.The park is not huge compared to other theme worlds but the availability of everything within close proximity is an added nouns when you consider most kids into lego will be under 10.Bit of advice: try going early in the school holidays and staying for the day as it is one of the more popular attractions.,4.0
3385,Legoland Malaysia - much more than we thought!,"Wow - we had an awesome time at Legoland. We are a family of four, with two kids, ages 5 and 8 from Australia.  We booked the VIP tour and we were fortunate to be the very first VIP's at Legoland Malaysia, so we did get some outstanding attention!We didn't realise the size of Legoland prior to arrival (if we had, we would have stayed at the Legoland hotel), as it turns out about 6 hours was enough to get through Legoland, but ran out of time for the attached water park (and apparently a couple of other nearby attractions). We started off being greeted in the foyer of the Legoland Hotel and escorted to a private dining room, where we had an excellent cooked breakfast and watched a short (but interesting) video about the history of Lego. We found the staff incredibly attentive and helpful - we have visited lots of theme parks and we found the staff very polite and nothing was to much trouble. After breakfast we met Steffan, a ""Master Builder"" for Lego, who had come across from Germany. He was great, provided a great insight into the world of Lego and built many of the Star Wars Lego models on display worldwide. We finished off building mini versions of ourselves, which were immortalised into Legoland history and glued into the Singapore exhibition. We then had lunch and commenced on ride after ride, jumping any queues thanks to our VIP passes. Both the kids had a great time and we ended up purchasing lots of Lego at the end - including a Simpsons themed Lego pack. Great place to spend a day, but likely a one off experience - but if I had our time again, would have stayed a couple of days.",5.0
3386,Love It!,My family really enjoyed our short stay here at the Legoland Malaysia. Mini Land was really nice. We would definitely go back to this place.,5.0
3387,Not much fun for the money,"Went on a school day, no queues for rides. About 30 minutes taxi from Johor Raya area, and we paid around RM 50. Tickets are cheaper if you buy at least 7 days earlier, or a Malaysian with MyKad, or have discount vouchers.Good: They have staff photographers who can help you take photographs. No more shall you be left out from the family photos. Going on a school day means you get to ride as much as you want without any queues.OK: Some food areas and some games to try out your skillsBad: Limited type of rides and somehow the 4d movie was not functioning well on the day of visit.Worse: Hardly any budget taxis to get you home to the city/airport. Only blue executive taxis that charge 2-3 times more on their meters. Suggest to call for a taxi (get the number of the one that sent you there and tell them how long you will take) or use phone apps (such as MyTeksi... be patient and wait)",3.0
3388,more suitable for kids,"my favorite attraction is Legoland is only the Lego Star Wars place (I was in awe because it was soooo cool, all the things really are moving. Star Wars fan must love this place) but other than it, I was kinda disappointed. the rides are too kid-friendly, nothing's cool, except Project X. but overall, if you just want to take a look and visit, maybe you should, because you could take a bunch of photos with Lego, because the decorations are nice and most of it made of Lego.",4.0
3389,Weekend Legoland trip,Legoland is purely for kids between ages 4 to 12. The instant shocker was that the place was so small when we had come with the expectation that it wld be on a sprawling land space. The place was empty when we visited it on jan 11. We got the combo tix for water theme park within 5 mins. We were a company of 4 adults and 1 toddler and were disappointed by the looks of it as the lego figurines were dirty and faded due to the sun. The pavement to the entrance had stones which were not laid properly cos there were so many wobbly stones. Rides are not exciting enough for adults or even teens. The sun was scorching but there were not many shady trees or rest spots which added on to our lack of enthusiasm. Overall it was disappointing and not worth our money unless you have kids who are in the age range of 4 to 12.,2.0
3390,Only for the kids,This place is fun for the kids. I was traveling with my friends aging from 23-24years old. We didn't had so much fun. Hong Kong Disneyland and Hong Kong Oceanpark is way better.,3.0
3391,My son loves it!,"Went to the theme park twice because they have the buy 1 free 1 tickets promotion. We did not expected this promotion though, i think they offer it on certain days on the spot.My son is just over the 100cm height limit, so he is able to cover around 80% of the rides.We were there during the 2015 New Year holiday week, weather was very good, cloudy all day and surprisingly the park is not full either, queue for the rides are short so we are able to cover a lot of the rides and also watch a few of the shows. Cleanliness wise, 5 stars for the park. The toilets are very clean, they always has someone standby there to clean the toilet. The baby room is awesome too, they have everything you need to take care of a baby. Hot water, bottle warmer, microwave, fridge, baby rocker, crib, sofa, play corner etc... It's the best public baby room i've seen so far.The lego store inside are selling some limited edition rare lego sets, i'm not sure how rare are those as i'm not a lego fan.One thing that is dissapointing is that they do not have a parade when near to closing time, like other theme parks have. If they have it, it would be a perfect ending for the trip.If you have small children, most probably you will need 2 days to cover all the rides, because they tend to get tired in the late afternoon. If for adults, you're able to cover the park in a day.Overall, this is a pretty impressive theme park, comparable to some theme parks overseas.",5.0
3392,Kids love this place,"This is a perfect place for kids from 6 to around 10, though not too friendly for a 3.5 year old girl. There are too safe on the height requirements that my little can't ride on even the simple rides. Though my 2 boys and their cousin love it, and find this place even better than disneyland Hongkong and Universal Studio Singapore. They all love the place but the the weather, its too hot here all year round. Right across the park, there is a little mall with Burger King, KFC and a Chinese restaurant that we forgot the name but was good.",4.0
3393,Me and the boys at Legoland,"In December I took my 2 boys, aged 11 and 9, to Legoland. We only has 1 day in Malaysia unfortunately. Legoland was wonderful. We didn't have to line up as we had tickets with our accommodation at the Legoland Hotel. Yes it was hot and steamy but we expected that. We are from Perth so not used to the humidity but there are indoor displays and shady spots to get away from the heat. Also a couple of the rides get you wet - the kids loved the jetski like one (can't remember the name!) I could push a button and waterbomb them as they went past. Nearly everyone there is asian and so my blonde haired, blue eyed boys caught the attention of the fake police who arrested them several times and cracked us all up. These  little touches added to the enjoyment. The lego shop proved popular with my 11 year old. It wasn't cheaper than back in Australia but he had saved money and had to buy one. There is also a shop where you can make 3 minifigures which was fun for the boys. They also got their Legoland licence and went on every ride. The Star Wars display is amazing and the highlight for my lego mad son. Plus it was nice and cool in there. Not sure that older kids would enjoy all the rides but my boys had a really great day there. We didn't have much time for the waterpark as we had to get to Singapore that day but we popped in and the boys went down a couple of waterslides. Pretty average but we had been to Wet and Wild on the Gold Coast back in April which was way better.",5.0
3394,Rate the water park better,"2 days and unlimited access to both the theme park and the water park.   Stayed at the hotel, which wash really convenient, as we did split both days between both parks. My kids (8, 7 and 3) loved both, but all agreed the water slides topped the theme park.  The green tunnel is awesome.... Just when I thought I couldn't go any faster, the ride got even steeper and faster.  My boys 7 and 8 loved it too.  I reckon kids 10 and older wouldn't like Lego theme park much, but there is something for everyone at the water park.",4.0
3395,Legoland,"A promise to visit legoland was the only reason our 7yr old ""came along"" for our 4 wk holiday.We kept it till the end, as a result he enjoyed it even more. Theres something for everyone and you easily need a day to cover legoland. If planning on visiting the waterpark, would suggest an overnight stay. The miniland is amazing and we thoroughly enjoyed it. Also on display was a star wars miniland, which was truly spectacular.",5.0
3396,Good for children inspiration,"We love water park very much, If you have time, 2 days is better than 1 day.For the theme park , there are many thing to do but not for too young children,Water park is suitable for all gen.Uber taxi is not expensive in Malaysia, for a return trip there are many taxi at legoland ",4.0
3397,Had good fun!,"Pleasant and easy drive of about 25 minutes from Johor Bahru city centre to Legoland Malaysia.Purchased the 1-day Theme park pass at the counter. (Please take note that if you have any discount voucher, the ticket price will be discounted from the full standard ticket price at the counter not the standard price stated on the website. The  price stated online is the special price if purchased online) Staff manning  the counter are courteous and bubbly. There were plenty of attractions for kids & family. Had good fun at the live musical theater show too. If you are a fan of roller coasters, the three roller coasters are meant for kids so they won't give any thrill to roller coaster junkies ^_^ but ride them anyway and join in the fun..Had lunch at the market  place/food court. Food are priced between RM 17 to RM 28 and the portion & taste are quite satisfactory.Public toilets there are well maintained by the janitors. Floors are dry and no unpleasant smell. Were there from 10.30am to 6.00pm. (Park closed an hour earlier on Public Holiday..usually they closed at 7pm) but we haven't got the chance to go for every single attraction - with an over excited 5 year old and a year old baby, things could be a bit slower :)",4.0
3398,Adults can have fun too,"We had extra days to spend while in Singapore, so we decided to go to nearby Johor and Legoland. This place is definitely for kids but we as adults were able to have some fun too. We enjoyed the mini land displays and were amazed at the millions of Lego pieces the designers used to build the models. Because it was on a weekday, there were practically no lines on the rides. We were able to repeat the rides many times. The mini models of Star Wars were incredible.",3.0
3399,Had a good time,"Although we went during monsoon and it rained on us and some of the rides had to be shut due to lightning.. We had a wonderful time.. We range from ages 64 to 7 years old... we all had a good time.. We didnt wait in line for longer than 10 minutes.. Do try to buy tickets online as I saw a huge queue at the ticket booth. Had fun, even though I thought I wasn't going to. If going during monsoon maybe invest in a 2 day ticket.",4.0
3400,Only for lego enthusiasts & little kids,Not recommended for youths or adults looking for a thrilling adventure. But definitely a must-go for lego enthusiasts and little kids. Drop by the nearby premium outlets for some shopping if you get too bored.,3.0
3401,only fun for kids,"if you have kids, then maybe it's worth go to this place. but it's not if you're going to this place with your friends. This theme park is not really attractive. with that price, you better go to Universal Studio Singapore. It's hard to find public transport to go to this area, usually, public transportation only provided for those who travel from Singapore-Johor immigration. For those who want to go around from Johor area other than JB, it's quite hard to find a bus or taxi to go here.",3.0
3402,A place for children!,We hired a private car from Singapore. Trip was smooth and fast.Legoland is full of children rides and fast roller coasters.The children loved it!Ensure sunscreen is applied as the place is lack of shade.,5.0
3403,Good but can be so much better ,"We spent a day at Legoland Malaysia and are already planning to go back. We were there from 11am till 8pm. Since we booked online we didn't have to queue but the staff seemed to be managing the crowd well anyway with no long queues at the entrance (that was the rides sigh).What we visited:1. Driving school at Lego city: long 30 min wait for the 6 to 13 age grp. Our son got bored waiting so we ended up leaving to explore other parts. This looked exciting though as the kids get to drive small cars and can even get a license for MYR 35.2. Legoland live theatre: was lured in here thinking it was the 4D theatre and didn't realise that it was live. The show was mediocre to put it politely. It was a Christmas show about a boy who didn't believe in Santa. I seriously wonder how relevant this is in an Asian Muslim country. My son was stone bored and the performance was neither entertaining nor funny. It had a bunch of strangely costumed women acting as the small 'boy', toy soldiers, a ballerina and the boy's mother. The elf who was there to convince the boy was seriously awful. His only attempt at entertainment being the occasional head stand. Santa was frustratingly off screen (stuck in the chimney so only his boots were visible). I found it so annoying, I can only imagine what the kids thought. Only pro is that the theatre is AC so you can cool off on a hot day. 3. Mini countries exhibit: We loved this. My son's favorite was the Chima mini land and the squirting buttons on some exhibits especially the Singapore Merlion  (all I will say is stand back)! We loved the intricacy of the urban city scapes and the Angkor exhibit. The Taj is seriously beautiful too.  As is the ship yard / port mini land. Only annoying thing were the adult female tourists repeatedly crawling into the Chima mini land dome for pics with their boyfriends while all the kids waited.  4. Market restaurant: we had lunch here. If you're vegeterian you might want to carry food or step out and try the mall at the entrance. My garden salad had what looked like bacon (but couldn't be I guess). Nice thing is that they give each person an apple with your meal.  The toy badge with the kids meal is very strange as it has no clasp and is effectively a small plastic circle. We made ours into magnets at home at my son's suggestion. Also you apparently get a mini figure key chain with an adult combo meal but you only find out at the check out counter and no one knows what that meal is. The restaurant is pretty with lovely lego statues but was extremely crowded with 0 ambience at lunch time.5. Star Wars exhibit: The entrance to the exhibit was very exciting with tall life size statues of C3PO, Vader and R2D2. You then enter a tiny room where they show a short SW film. It was super crowded even though the staff did some sort of count at the entrance. The adults were all standing in front and my son couldn't see a thing. Luckily it wasn't an original video but one he's seen on YouTube several times. We were then allowed to view the actual exhibits and these are quite awesome. There's pretty much 1 room for each episode and some iconic scenes (battle on Mustafar, Ewok tree house scene, the Millennium Falcon being shot at and taking off, Hoth  etc.). All the exhibits have  interactive buttons that trigger sound and light effects and movement.  This is great for SW fans only I guess. The exhibit then opens into a Lego store dedicated to SW. No mini figures available here only sets and clothes and some magnets. Prices are very reasonable vs. Singapore so it might be good to plan and buy here. 6. Lego kingdoms (with the castle and knights): We only saw this from the outside as our son wasn't interested in it and only wanted to play the games outside (ring the bottle and fish out ducks from water to win hideous soft toys). It has a store too and some interesting looking horse back ride that looked mild enough for young kids.7. 4D theatre: We saw the Chima movie.  Queues were long with no indication that all doors opened into different sections of the same theatre. The regulars know to queue at the door furtherest to the entrance so you're right in front of the theatre. The show itself was fun but way too short (literally 10 mins after a 30 min wait to get in). It wasn't exactly 4D either as the only 4D part of the experience was being sprayed with icy water for like 5 mins. This would be great on a hot day but we were there on a cool drizzly day in a cold theatre. Very unpleasant though our son was thrilled. 8. Viewing platform: After a 30 min wait we got in and the doors wouldn't close do the platform was shut temporarily! 9. Boat ride: This was fun. The boats aren't easy to maneuver though you can't tell when watching. We enjoyed driving around and bumping into the sides and other boats. It's very short though. And several kids don't get off when the boat renters the docking part but continue on for another round which is annoying if you've been waiting in line for your turn. 10. Lego train ride: Again a short ride through part of the park  (around mini land and lego city mainly). The train is very bright and picturesque. However I'd suggest sitting towards the middle or back to avoid diesel fumes up front.  Also annoyingly we were squashed into one seat row which was really uncomfortable for 3 (my husband was asked to move and sit with us) while families with more kids sat comfortably 2 to a row. That's pretty unfair. 11. Lego stores at the beginning: There are 3, one's more an open kiosk. They have some very unusual stationary that I haven't seen elsewhere. Again it's mainly sets but also some bags, stationary, magnets, boxes etc. Alarmingly there is a make your own mini figure section that's an awful mess with peices strewn all over and children messing around.  Not sure how they keep track of any of it. 12. Lego educational center / master builder: we breezed through these. They were mainly filled with relieved parents and snoozing grand parents  enjoying the AC and the opportunity to sit. Great on a hot day I guess. They have shows / demos that we missed. 13. Ride near 4D theatre: I forget what this is called but it was basically a 'ride' where you pull yourself and your partner up with a rope while seated. Unfortunately my son got horrible rope burn and his fingers blistered. We had to take him to the first aid center near the market restaurant where the nurses were very kind and applied meds and bandages. That ride should have gloves provided. Our favorite was the enter set of mini land exhibits. Our son's favorite was the Star Wars exhibit. Legoland Malaysia has the cleanest public toilets I've seen which was great as we spent the entire day there. While eating options inside are limited, there is a small mall that you walk through to approach the park that has some good food options. Getting a taxi back to our hotel was quick and easy. ",3.0
3404,Bus to Legoland from singapore things to consider,"By bus - Legoland- to go via singapore The consensus of many travelers is go to legoland as a side trip from singapore and would take about 3 hrs. Here are some things to consider- there are 4 stops at immigration that one had to alight from the bus.  going there  singapore, malaysia and going back malaysia, singapore- there are several busloads of travellers, and during the time i travelled in december - it took 30 mins. From singapore flyer and almost an hour to alight from the bus because we were waiting for the buses ahead of us for their passengers to clear singapore immigration.- and then again, the queue at immigration was long- repeat the same process at  Malaysian immigration plus bags have to be screened. The buses queue up also and allows passengers to alight one bus at a time.  Since the facility is small... It could take some time to go through customs xray machine.- repeat again the same process going back - long queues at immigration - repeat again the process at singapore immigration - this time you have to clear customs meaning bags are screened going back to singapore. - another thing to consider is if one is unlucky enough to have bus mates who are inconsiderate and take their sweet time boarding the bus oblivious of the fact that their other bus mates are waiting for everyone to be on board for the bus to go on its way. We were lucky that the bus heading back to singapore was not full, and the passengers mainly from hk hopped on the bus immediately after clearing customs and immigration. We were not so lucky going to legoland.- there are several tours which combine hello kitty and big club attraction and legoland... My two cents DON'T.   We reached legoland before noon.  Combined  Tours halve time between two attractions  so it would be a hurried affair to go through one attraction specially if it is your first time there. So you have to choose what you really want to do for 5-6 hrs.Imho - i would consider  taking the 5 hour ride from kl ... At least it saves me all that hassle",4.0
3405,How to get more out of the Legoland on a very busy day,"We decided to visit the Legoland on the Boxing Day which was a Friday.  We expected it to be crowded but still it was way more crowded than what we expected - we queued for 1.5 hours just to buy the tickets !  Some tips:1. Don't visit on a busy day !  For the state of Johor, Friday has been swapped with Sunday and so Fridays are now weekends.  If it's a public holiday for Singapore, expect it to be crowded too.2. If you must visit on a busy day, and plan to visit both the water park and the theme park (which I suspect is what more people will do), then you may want to visit the water park first. This is the opposite of what most people do.  Most people will likely visit the theme park in the morning and then the water park in the afternoon -- you can tell from what the visitors wear and carry in their bags, and also the two parks have different entrances.  3. When in water park, some of the slides with rafts (Red Rush) take 4 people per raft.  The ushers normally try to fill the rafts to speed up the queue.  Some in the queue are couples and some are families.  If you are a couple or one person, you may volunteer to fill the raft when the ushers ask for volunteers.  And you can do that from the back of the queue, so this speeds  up a lot.Please give your helpful vote if you find this helpful.",4.0
3406,It's a place for small kids,"This is a place to visit if you love Lego. Otherwise it's just another attraction for little kids as all the shows, games and rides are meant for children. I liked and admired the figurines made from Legos, these people really put in lots of effort to build them. Hopefully the LEGOLAND management will be able to upkeep the Lego buildups and the park as under rain and shine, surely the pieces will not be as glory as new.",3.0
3407,Great day spent!,Went Legoland's both water and land theme park. I'm personally not an outdoor water person but I've enjoyed myself in the water themepark! The water slides were exhilarating while the many lego exhibits were pretty interesting. Remember to smack lots of sunblock on yourself though.,4.0

3410,Great,It's fun to go legoland it host the theme park was awsome but the best was the water park I its a great place for kids but for teens and adults it would be the opposite of their  choice  only one problem is the food sucks but the hotel is great to go but it's a little bit wacky over the top,4.0
3411,Lego!,We took a bus from Singapore to Johor Bahru which was not as bad as I thought it would be. It just took about 2hrs to and another 2hrs back. Legoland was perfect for my children aged 7 and 10. The kids enjoyed the sights and the rides since everything was lego. It's a perfect place to bring kids aged 11yrs and below. Food was good and reasonable. Cleanliness of toilets was good enough. We went on a weekday so the volume of the visitors was not too much. The kids did not have to queue too long.,4.0
3412,Heaps to do & fun,"Flat & easy to walk around,not much shelter though. Appropriate ages would be 6years to about 12. Either take spare clothes or prepare to walk around while you dry off as there are a few rides where you get really wet. You can buy a rain poncho for $4.",5.0
3413,Family Day,Legoland is majority about family & kidsYour kids will love this place.But for teenager & adult dun think so.Food inside Legoland is not nice hence have your lunch before getting inside.,4.0

Just for a little advice, we know December or January is a peak season, for cleaning room must be detail, cause i found a one slipper, tissue and snack under the bed. But overall Hotel Legoland is high recommended if you want play at Legoland theme park and waterpark",5.0
3416,Lego lovers dream place,What an awesome place. My 6 yrs old and 3 yrs old loved it. We stayed in marina resort and took a taxi to the lego land. On the first day we spent the day in dry land and second day at the lego land water park. ,5.0
3417,A wonderful day of family excitement,"Bought a day pass from the internet and was very delighted that i don't have to queue long to get the tickets i have purchased. Upon entrance there was only 1 entry point opened with people queueing to get into the park. The park has some new rides that i did not see during my first n second visit. The park lack necessities such as picture booth, where visitors can take pictures of themselves with scenic background of the park main attraction. Lack less expansive goodies that primary school students can buy to remember the park by i.e. book marks, stickers, handkerchief, hairbands or head gears for girls, etc. The best was the new year fireworks. It was AWESOME! I would definitely come again next year for the new year fireworks. Good job Legoland Malaysia. ",5.0
3418,Great for visitors from near or afar,"An excellent family day out with something for everyone! If you're likely to visit again within the year, an annual pass is highly recommended and this will not only give you free parking and discounts on food and drinks as advertised, but also enable you to exit and re-enter the park, for example, to eat somewhere else either more cheaply or to cater for different tastes/dietary requirements ;-)Although our kids (aged 1.5 and 3.5) can't go on all the attractions, there's more than enough for them to enjoy for the whole day, including shows, movies, and play areas, and it's really stroller friendly :-)",5.0
3419,I was a child again,"I loved the place. My kids love Lego so they enjoyed all of the rides and figures. Loved all the decorations especially in the toilets! Wired, I know! The photographers were such great idea. The only problem was when we collected our photos, the best ones could not be retrieved for some reason. The place could do with more shaded areas with seats. My son and husband never got to see the figures of iconic sites around the world. The were to hot to walk around. Also the prices of the Lego sets were a bit too much compared to ordinary shops.",3.0
3420,Wonderland for kids,"Visited both the dry and water themed parks recently. The kids love it! Older kids with a stronger heart will like the rides while toddlers can have some fun in the baby pools. There are a number of standard baby diaper changing stations around the dry theme park. But there is also this baby room for toddlers below 3 worth mentioning. This is a room where the parents with kids below 3 can escape some heat and rest a while. You can diaper change, prepare formula milk for your little ones in this room. Not forgetting there is a breastfeeding corner for the breastfeeding mums. It has a small play area and some baby cribs too. A good hiding place if your baby is whining and in need of a quiet and cooling place for his nap or meal. A good hiding place from the heat outside too.It also has a small pantry with a microwave oven, a conventional oven and a fridge. So parents can actually heat up self-supplied baby food here! Mothers can also store their expressed breast milk in the fridge, just remember to collect it before leaving this wonderland. Kids are already asking when are we coming back..... ",4.0
3421,For Family,Good for family & plenty of rides which are suitable for kids. The walk path design is very good where it will show you all the attractions & rides...you won't miss it. There is also a map where you can put your rides stamp & get a prize if you have 10 stamps & 2 prize for over 14 stamps...but all the prize is the same. They should have provided more variety of prizes.,4.0
3422,Bricks and Mortar,Expected to be kids world but somehow there are something for everybody if not seeing others to enjoy the rides. You need a whole day to go on each and every rides there are. Again F&B prices are high.,4.0
3423,Great experience!,Kids and kids at heart will love this theme park. There are different activities and attractions for both young and adults.  They also have activities that the whole family will enjoy together. Their airconditioned play area is so refreshing after a warm walk around the park. The replicas of different landmarks is an interesting attraction.,4.0
3424,"Great theme park, but...","You will enjoy more if your kids are all with height 110cm.  Comparing with Universal Studio, this park has more activities that engage the kids involvement.  However, most games required 110cm.  If all of your kids are 110cm above, it is worthwhile to purchase annual pass.  Not recommended for family with kids below 80cm.  You will find it boring.Overall, I like this park and I think the ticket is worthwhile.",4.0
3425,Exciting adventure for young kids,We took our kids (5 & 7) to Legoland Malaysia for Christmas. Getting out of Singapore the customs line was long. We took a coach so we had to wait at customs until everyone got through. Took over an hour. Prepurchase tickets because the ticket line was long. There are workers all over the park who will take family photos for you. We didn't get to do everything as rain closed some rides. Kids had a great time. Definitely glad we went. If you are in Singapore I say make a day trip out of it and go. We didn't do the water park though. Maybe next time.  ,4.0
3426,Always a great time,"Went to Legoland in October and it was awesome since there were not many people there. Came back to surprise the kids for Christmas and it did not disappoint. The staff is really great and it really is a good time for both kids and adults. Buy a premium season pass, even if you just go two times it is worth it! We would do 1/2 a day at Legoland amusement side and then 1/2 a day at the waterpark. The kids love it and as a parents we love it too! The premium pass gets you discounts on food/drinks and buying all those legos. Even though we went during the holiday rush we never waited more than 20 mins in line for a ride. It is really worth every penny and we can't wait to go back!",5.0
3427,Best in Malaysia !!,"Overall is a wonderful experience for kids and adult. Ride are fun and exiting. We had burger which is good but inflated price. Cant finish all the ride as is begin raining, will be back next time.",4.0
3428,Legoland - a must do!,Came on the first bus from Singapore (with WTS Tours - who were excellent) and left on the last one. Got some great Lego which we have not seen anywhere else (and my son is an avid collector).  Prices were very reasonable. Also themed clothing was well prices and amazing selection. Star Wars was our favourite exhibition but we were impressed with the whole park. The team were so friendly and helpful and the park was spotlessly clean and beautifully presented. One of the things I really enjoyed was the clear and simple layout. You were not left wondering which way to go and whether or not you missed anything. We went there on a weekday so queues were short (with the exception of driving school). Would have loved to do the waterpark too but ran out of time. The main theme park is a full day so don't make the mistake of going to the water park first if you only have 1 day to enjoy. If coming from Singapore be prepared for the passing through 2 sets of customs / immigration. On the way down it was quick and easy. On the way home it took 90 minutes to clear Singapore immigration. It was excruciatingly slow. Can highly recommend Legoland as an entertaining and fun day out for both kids and adults. Ps best to make sure your children are over 120cm to enjoy the majority of the rides. ,5.0
3429,Great fun for kids and kids a like....,"Had a great day with the kids. Enjoyed every ride, especially the fire fighting where we get to play together as a family and compete with other families. Worth every penny... The staff's were very helpful and friendly. Luckily during school holidays they have extended the closing time to 8 pm. During school holidays can get a bit crowded , so you have to wait in long queues. My 4 year old loved the roller coaster but pity they didn't let her ride the technic twister. If you have small children better bring your strollers or rent one. A great family outing to be remembered. Will sure visit again. üòä",5.0

Best way to travel is from Singapore it's about 50kms but if want to travel from KL it take us about 4hrs by road....Last but not the least ...kids will surely enjoy and lots see and much to buy...bye!!!!",4.0
3431,Family fun,We purchased a 2 day pass which allowed us in 30 min before the park opened. We could exit and enter as many times as we wanted. It also gave us entry into the water park. We found this worth it considering we were staying at the hotel. The kids had a great time. There was plenty to do. Lots of fun. Worth a visit. ,4.0
3432,Brilliant time!,We spent a day at the theme park and another day at the water park. The kids really enjoyed it and there were a lot of activities for them to do especially as we were there on Christmas and Boxing Day. Highly recommend it if you have small children but may not be as exciting for teenagers or adults. ,5.0
3433,Fine for small kids,I have just spent the day with my family at Legoland Malaysia. I took an early taxi from Singapore and managed to beat the traffic. It took me less than an hour to reach the park. Overall the park looks quite new. There are quite a few food outlets selling the usual poor quality theme park food. The rides are very short and mostly suitable for kids under 10. Overall it is fine for a day trip but i made the mistake of booking at the hotel for a night. The theme park and water park can easily be completed in one day if you enter the park early.,3.0
3434,Nostalgic ride from childhood,"i came to Legoland with huge expectation. Since i was playing lego at my childhood, i was pretty amaze that everythings tend to be made from lego bricks form. I enjoy the lego, but not the ride. I think i am too old for all the rides they provide there. It will be fun if i were 13 years old.Pros:+ cool lego things+ limited lego at store inside the theme park+ lego themed hotel, kids will enjoy itCons:- ride were for kids- hot, you will sweat like crazy- pretty expensive (around USD 45)",3.0
3435,Time and money wasted,"Our 9 yr old boy loves lego.  He was excited about the Legoland trip before we got there, while our older children did not want to go but forced to go because we do thing as family.Stuck in traffic both ways from and to Singapore.  The park was big with nice lay out.  The staffs were not very efficient, both in communication and in service.  People who went there on the same day that we did, jumped queue.  One ""big"" family, young couple and 1/2 dozen kids, cut in line, though we told them off but they pretended not to understand English.  Even young kids cut in line at as well.  Do these people have the concept of queuing?  Staffs were not very organised, worked ""lethargically"", they seemed to be in slow motion and looking like being forced to work.Only few rides worth the trouble of queuing for.Water everywhere in the toilets as people prefer to wash with water rather than wipe?  Through out the park, one could see people threw the rubbish here and there instead of putting them in the bins.We were ready to go home after 2 hours being there.",2.0
3436,Legoland ‚Äì family fun day,"I went because I had to ‚Äì at 53 and with end of year budget, it‚Äôs the only treat for my 9-year old that I could afford in terms of time and expenses. And I was pleasantly surprised, I enjoyed a few of the rides (I was once a roller-coaster fanatic in the USA during my younger days). Those that involved high speed rotating motion over a small diameter circular domain were of course given the pass. The high point for me would be the water ride, the slow start, the build-up in the cave and finally the fall with the end splash. Well, the lego miniature replicas of Kuala Lumpur International Airport and all the other landmarks (local and international) were awesome! There were rides and games for children and adults. We arrived at 10:45 am and had to line up for 45 minutes to get the tickets, and that was with 12-13 ticket counters opened. Parking was RM9 per entry. Acceptable considering we got a RM10 food discount for each ticket purchased as well as a free January 2015 entry ticket.Initially the que for each ride was only a few minutes but as the afternoon came, it took as much as 15  minutes for the favourite rides. Then it rained at about 4 pm and all the rides had to be stopped due to the lightning and thunder. Unless you are sure of the fine weather, it can be a waste buying tickets online. No reimbursement offered. The restaurants nearby (outside) in the Medini Mall are pretty cool ‚Äì from fast food (KFC and Burger King) and cafes (Kopitiam and Gloria Jeans), plus the others to choose from e.g. Pancake International House (yummy).",5.0
3437,Great Legoland!!!,"If its not raining, we would have enjoyed the experience better and visit all the stations. Most importantly, its not just for kids. Adults also enjoyed it. At the firestation, we get to race to put away the fire. Maybe a little token for the winning team would make their day. Anyway, we simply love it. And as we have not gone to the water theme park yet, that would be our next plan in the coming year.",4.0
3438,"Great concept, poor execution...","Being an international brand, one would expect no less from Legoland Malaysia. Of course, we do discount the fact that English is not the national language and accept lower level of proficiency from the local park employees. Sadly, from the onset the lack of language skills hindered many of the staff from being able to communicate properly. Announcements were made through  mumbles of incomplete sentences and could not be understood even by locals let alone foreign visitors. Some staff made the effort to bring out the spirit of what a theme park experience is about (especially those in blue uniforms) others just did what needed to be done to get the job done.Overall, it is a place for the younger ones. Kids aged 5-10yrs would enjoy it best especially if they like lego. Only 2 rides would appeal to anyone older than 12 yrs, Project X and the Dragon coaster. Still mild if compared to your typical thrill ride but fun nevertheless.Warning on 2 important points to note. The queues for entrance tickets can get very long especially during holiday season. Although most counters are open, you could expect to be in line for almost an hour. The other minus is for parking-if you plan to drive there. The parking  bays are on loose gravel and sand so it can get messy when it rains. Quite pathetic for the MYR9 you pay for parking.I do hope the management take steps to improve the place in time (it is still quite young in operations) as this is definately Johor's no 1 attraction.",3.0
3439,Day trip with the kids ,Took the kids on a day trip to Legoland on Boxing day. Expected it to be jam packed but was pleasantly surprised it wasn't as crowded as we expected.We got there early and didn't have to queue too long for the rides. Rides seem to be well maintained. Generally facilities were ok. I wish they had more covered seating areas especially where there had attractions for kids to play in. It was raining when we visited and the parents had to crowd in a small area away from the rain while waiting for the kids to finish playing.The staff there are very friendly and helpful and most importantly speak decent English.Food is understandably more expensive being a theme-park. Had some burgers and fries. Freshly made but nothing great.,3.0
3440,Waste time!,"For those who drive to Legoland, please beware of the rude and unfriendly guard. When i was visiting the plase during 25th Dec (public holiday), I can't find the parking. I found a Legoland guard/staff and asking for help to know where does had empty or area that can park my car but he didn't help but with a very bad attitude and chase me away. Please don't drive to Legoland during peak season or you may facing the same unpleasent memories that would ruin your holiday mood.",1.0
3441,Must go!,"Thanks to my nephew, me and my brothers had a chance to visit Legoland  We got the combo tickets (water park & theme park) since we wanted to tryout everything.Thanks to the forgiving weather, the skies cleared up when we got in. The water park rides are good, especially the wave tunnel! Do start early if you are going to 2 parks, coz usually you'll get real hungry after the water park. So after minus meal & wash up timing, we've pretty much left with a couple hours for the theme park only. Thankfully the Q for the rides at the theme park didn't take too long (avg 10-15 mins) Will recommend to all kids & teenagers or Lego fans to visit Legoland! ",4.0
3442,Parent & Children Have A Great Time!!!,We really enjoyed both Theme Park & the Water Park. The on-duty staff are very helpful & happy with their duty. The facilities and rides are in good condition during our visit. We did almost all the rides and there were no super long queue even during the school/Xmas holidays. Water Park is as good. Do not miss out the live shows and 4D cinema shows. We really enjoyed...,5.0
3443,Great trip!,"The rides are fairly normal as most of the rides are suitable for kids. The dragon rollercoaster was ok not to scary. The water ride was the best but remember to wear poncho or bring extra clothes as you'll get very wet! The game stalls are overly priced. Enjoyed the ""Mini Land"" where u get to see the monuments from the different countries. Must remember to watch the 4D movie screening! Overall, the trip was an enjoyable one.",4.0
3444,Kids love it,Very interesting .. Everything is from Lego .the rides more for primary kids and under . Good court just best to the Legoland hotel .. The hotel price is a bit pricey  but can sleep 10 people . The room is stunning . We  took pirates room .. Awesome ,5.0
3445,Wonderful Trip,"The theme park was very fun, and the hotel was excellent. The hotel served a wide variety of food, and the room was very clean and comfortable. The rides at the park were exhilarating and extremely enjoyable. We had tons of fun at Legoland!",5.0
3446,Visit To Legoland Malaysia,"Visited LEGOLAND Malaysia with my family during the Dec school holidays. Bought the advance one day ticket online and save the hassle of queuing up at the ticket counter.Printed out the tickets in advance and presented them to the entrance counter for validation. Did not have a positive first impression of LEGOLAND as the staff manning the entrance looked uninterested and did not even bother to welcome us! Once we were in the theme park, took a map and start planning what we wanted to visit. So many attractions to visit with so little time so need to pick what interest us as a family. Experienced a few rides and one of the best was the Dino Island water ride - be prepared to get wet so get ready your ponchos. Being a Star Wars fan, it is a must to visit the Lego Star Wars Indoor Miniland recently opened this year. Excellent display of Star Wars Lego miniature props.   Depending on the weather, be advised to prepare for rain or shine. We experience a very hot day so need to dehydrate all the time. Bring water container if possible as buying drinks in the theme park will be expensive. Encountered some technical issues at some of the rides i.e we waited 30 mins to ride The Tower but was later told  the tower got stucked at the top and need to wait for repair. Wasted time waiting in the queue. Overall, I would give a rating of 6 out of 10 for our first visit to LEGOLAND. One area that the Management need to improve is the public announcement made by their staff. Most of the time, I can't understand what was being announced over the PA system. They were either too fast or not clear. Cleary a lack of proper pronunciations / communication skills.",3.0
3447,Better than expected,"We've been spoiled, having visited Legoland in San Diego, California, twice before, so I had very low expectations.  I took my 3 daughters (10, 7, 5) and they loved it!  I also splurged before the Christmas holiday and did an overnight in the Legoland Hotel.The pluses:- Park is bigger than expected, and the 9:30 early admission for hotel guests gave us more time before 10:00 gates open to do the popular rides (Technic roller coaster, driving school)- Staff was phenomenal - patient, informative, and spoke great English- Mini-land featured Asian cities only, and was amazing- There were rides appropriate for both my younger and older kids- Laid out nicely, and not too big to be overwhelming- Some Christmas decorations (though i would have liked more)- Food was adequate, and there were options right outside the gate if you wanted alternatives (Burger King, etc)- Italian restaurant in hotel was good- ATM machine onsite- Lots of restroom facilities, and most were clean- Hotel was super convenientThe negatives:- Water park was way below expectations - rides were not fun, park was dirty, and it was very, very crowded.  A boy had a bloody nose and 20 minutes later the blood was still on the ground.- Crowds - after 12:00, the main park was very crowded.  Granted, it is 2 days before Christmas!- The hotel, though loved by my kids, was was too ""themed"" for my liking - it was overwhelming.  We had a Kingdom themed room on the top floor, with a view of the park... but it wasn't my thing.My kids would go again in a heart beat.  And I would send them in a heart beat.  Just don't make it be me who takes them!Also look through other reviews for relevant tips - sunscreen, water, snacks, etc.",4.0
3448,Excellent place for family outdoor activity,"Its a very nice place for family with kids to go for outdoor activity. Good way to spend a day away from electronic gadget and internet to enjoy the theme park with family. The place is new, well maintained and hygienic. The theme park is awesome and the theme park ride was fantastic, but I do agree with others that not many shelter available within the park especially the Lego building model, bring along umbrella to shelter yourself from the hot sun. Its very nice of the theme park management to present the visitor with Lego mascot for kids to take photograph from time to time. The water rides are equally good and suitable even for a young kid (age 5 and above) because of low risk of injury.",4.0
3449,Heaven for Star Wars's fan,"Visited the park in Dec 22, 2014 with my wife, 14 yrs old daughter and 8 yrs old boy. The ride suited my boy but my daughter also enjoy the Dragon roller coaster & adventure ride so much. Must visit the Star Wars newly opened attractions. Amazed by all the settings and how Lego can done it so well. The park is one notch below top theme parks such as Disney and Universal interms of of the cleaness and the quality of the staff in promoting/entertaining the guests.",4.0
3450,International Standard. Good for the kids.,"The legoland is very big. The rides in the LEGOLAND is awesome to the family with the young child. My child love it so much. Please go ahead the Lego City to watch a show, your child sure love it. =)",5.0
3451,Theme park side is excellent. Waterpark rides excellent unfortunately other facilities at water park are a let down.,"Really enjoyed the theme park, no lines friendly helpful happy staff. We were lucky and went on a less busy day, hardly had to wait in any lines. The only down side of the day was the water parks facilities. We did the theme park in the morning and headed to the water park for lunch. Lines for food were long and service very slow, 40 minute wait to get a drink of water. If you go and do a two park pass in the one day have lunch/ stock up on water/ get a locker in the theme park as the water park locker room was chaotic and getting food and drink impossible. On the plus side the water park rides were excellent staff friendly and lines short.",4.0
3452,Pretty Entertaining for younger kids,"Decent variety of ride offerings in the main theme park. Appealing to younger kids below 10 years old. Older kids & adults could be bored though as there are only 1-2 adrenaline rushing rides. Not many sheltered areas within the park and this can be bad news to visitors during the rainy season like now in Dec.Had a bite @ a small cafe. As expected it's costly but average taste of food. The Star Wars displays are impressive. Don't miss this, Star Wars fans.4D show proves to be a tad too wet with the frequent showers of water. The show ended abruptly. Nice big & colorful Lego-modeled figurines in the park. Not a bad idea to go for the annual pass if you have young kids above 3 yrs old which is chargeable. Per entry entrance fee is priced 50% of annual pass! Lots of other benefits for annual pass holders.Will definitely be back! ",4.0
3453,Expensive,I was excited to visite Legoland with my child in Johor Bahru.... It¬¥s been awhile from trip to Denmark. I have to say I was disappointed to the place. First of all I think tickets are expensive. And what you get for that money.... Some of the cool rides were even closed because of the renovation or something... And yes first you spend lot of money to get in and then you spend your time queing to the rides and then you can spend rest of your money shopping. It¬¥s all about spending for sure. Even taxis here rip of your money. So be aware!,3.0
3454,Good fun,Great fun for all the family.Rides are primarily for little children but it seems as id they are constructing a new big ride.Annual tickets for both parks are definitely worth it as it is the same cost as two adult tickets.Water park is good and lifeguards are usually chatty and kind people.Enjoy !,4.0
3455,Pretty cool,"Its not average as my rating states. Heres why i deducted two stars. I deducted the first star because I live in Singapore and the jam to Johor was crazy. It was a 3 hour ride and thus my ticket was not fully used up as i wasted time travelling. Another reason why i deducted the other star was because refunds could not be issued for tickets that have been booked but bad weather caused the visit to be uncomfortable. It would be goood if refunds could be given if bad weather happens. However, plus points for family experience and pretty fun place to be",3.0
3456,"""Its nice to be a child again""",Its almost 3 in the afternoon when we arrive at legoland but the long wait from travel is worthy! This place is terribly awesome and amazing. From diff kinds of rides to miniatures at miniland its fantastic! You shouldnt miss this chance of a lifetime experience thats full of fun!,4.0
3457,Legoland Malaysia,"Visit the theme park if u have too much time to spare or if u are curious what to expect from the theme park. I mean, i visited the park during the December school holidays and it was pretty 'peaceful' with not much crowd. We spend about 3 hours there and manage to clear most of the rides (including snacking and shopping). There were 4 adults 2 teenagers and a 11 yr old in my group.  The park lack trees or maybe insufficient shelter to stay out of the sun.  The surrounding near the park is also quite bear as there are not much greeneries. Prepare to walk for about 5 to 10 mins to the entrance or ticketing booths (depending on the speed of ur group) from the Zone 2. Good luck if it rains ....  however all these said, i find the staff relatively friendly.  The 4D show was quite interesting and i must admit, it is better than the 4D Shrek @ USS.  The Star Wars exhibit and the Miniland are quite impressive. We did not visit the water park, so no comment.",3.0
3458,Very suitable for toddlers around 3-12 years old,"We have gone to Universal Studio during January and found that USS is more suitable for teen and adults but my little girls had very less choice to play and enjoy in USS. This Nov we went to Legoland and my little girls (5 years old and 3 years old) felt so excited as there are playground, car rider, boat ride, Lego making etc which they were too enjoyed. Besides, our elderly were so amazed of the mini land made by Lego. So creative and we took so much photos at mini land. We bought annual pass and will bring our children again to Legoland although we stay in north Malaysia. Annual pass can enjoy several privilege such as free parking (RM9 per entry), discount for certain retail product, 40%discount for stroller rental, etc. ",4.0
3459,kids will love it,kids under 12 will love this place! so much to do for them. so age appropriate. water park to cool off is brilliant too! as an adult be ready to watch and join in with the kids to make the most of the experience. ofcourse you need sunscreen and hat as shelter and shade is minimal. enjoy the family experience! ,5.0
3460,Photo-Fun Everywhere!,"Lego here, lego everywhere! A theme park mainly for kiddies. Rides are mainly for kiddies, but lego-lovers (like myself) would definitely be stuck at the MiniLand attraction where there were a million and one interesting figurines, architecture and vehicles. Personally, the MiniLand and the Star Wars exhibit is one you must go.The park had vast amount of space to walk around and definitely won't go hungry (eateries at every section).The only drawback of my park experience is that I felt that the park was a little life-less. Hopefully more mascots, activities, and introduction of parades would be presented at the park in the near future.Make sure you bring a camera with lots of batteries and memory space (for lego-lovers).",4.0
3461,Perfect place for kids aged 5 to 11,"My kids aged 5, 8 and 11 had a great time at the dry theme park. We were at LEGOLAND Malaysia for the very first time on 17 December 2014. Near the entry, my kids were attracted to the colourful Legoland Hotel - they were disappointed we were not going too stay there. It is worth checking out the different ticketing options - there were also discounts for Seniors.Thanks to previous reviewers, we came prepared. From 10:30am to 2pm, the sun was shinning, it was rather hot, we had our caps and water bottles. From 2pm to 5pm it was raining heavily, we used our raincoats, umbrellas and extra set of clothes, but we didn't bring extra socks!! Our shoes and socks were all wet. Don't think the Park was crowded that day. The queue was very fast, at most 5 mins!!. My 8 and 5 year old love the rides. After every ride, they will say:"" I want to do it again"". My 11 year old felt some rides were too kiddy - but he had fun too. We ate at Market restaurant. The set meals cost RM 25 to 28. There were many types of food available elsewhere but we became very hungry while we were near Market Restaurant. A group of singers sang Christmas Carols while we were lunching. They went table by table to sing different songs. It was fabulous! The Star Wars Miniland model display was the least thrilling for us. The Aquazone Wave Racers - if you are riding, you will definitely get wet on this one.",5.0
3462,Families with Young Children and Serious LEGO Fans will love it,"Especially great for families with young children. Not quite the same experience as the Legolands in Europe but it's great fun anyway. As you would expect, everything is LEGO themed, there's a delightful surprise at every turn whether it's a friendly LEGO statue or even a moving exhibit in the midst of the greenery. Miniland is distinctly Asian, which will be interesting for someone who has done some travelling in the area. Older kids might not enjoy this, but if they love lego then it's worth a shot!",4.0
3463,Lego overload,"We brought our kids (age 2+ and 5 years) and they had a blast in Legoland. We went to both theme parks, nope we didn't get the combo tickets. We wanted to space it out, hence we took our time and allocated one park per day. We arrived slightly before 12 pm and there were long queues at the ticket counters. However, once we got in, we didn't need to queue long for the rides even though it was school holiday period, which I guess going there on weekdays made a difference.The staffs were not strict and allowed us in with water bottles and some food in bags, but we noticed they stopped a group of people carrying KFC packs into the park. We parked in Medini Mall open car park and walked through the mall. We were surprised that parking per day on a weekday was RM 1. (hence another good reason to go on weekdays)We went to the Legoland theme park the first day. We brought stroller (which is advisable, if you have young kids) or there are some available for loan. We were lucky that the weather was good to us, cloudy but not rainy. The rides are very much dependent on height, hence, it is good to do some homework by shortlisting the rides your kids can go on their website prior your trip. The Junior Driving School, Aqua Zone Wave Racer as well as Royal Joust were so much fun for my 5-year old. We also ride on Duplo Train Express/ Observation Tower/ Lego City Airport/ Lost Kingdom and the Forestmen's Hideout (playground)/ which were 2-year-old-friendly. We made photo stops in Miniland as well as the newly added Star-Wars Miniland and caught a short 4D Lego movie which runs every 30 minutes. But the most memorable time for my 5-year old was in Build&Test, where he was given a set of wheels and he can create any form of vehicle and test it on the track. We also enjoyed being away from the heat as this place was air-conditioned. Good place to go if it rains.Lunch was great too, we expected that food will be a little expensive, however, I was pleasantly surprised when the cashier presented me with a complimentary key chain of a Chima figurine after I paid for 3 main course and drinks. They had Christmas specials this month; Festive show - 'When Santa got stuck up the Chimney' as well as the lights-up of the Lego Christmas tree at 7 pm. Closing time was extended to 8 pm, hence before we left, we checked the Brick shops near the entrance out.The 2nd day, we were dressed appropriately for water park (swim wear, sandals and brought towels and spare change of clothes). We paid separately RM 10 entrance fees for my toddler and was provided with two disposable swim diapers. We had an enjoyable time at the wave pool, Joker Soaker and the Duplo Splash Safari for younger kids. But what we loved the most was the Build-a Raft river where we went for 4 rounds. In terms of safety, life vests of sizes from infant to adults were widely available and life guards were around each corner. That said, parents should look out for their kids at all times. Towels and small lockers are available for rent for RM 20 each. There is a baby room on the right after the entrance for diaper change, breastfeeding, preparing milk/ solids. The shower cubicles are aplenty and each equipped with shampoo dispenser.The Lego staffs are friendly and approachable. Toilets in both parks are abundant and clean. Overall the parks are well maintained.  Tip: Bring a change of clothes, caps, umbrellas, towels and most importantly sunscreen. Stroller is a must with young kids.",5.0
3464,Good place for a short getaway especially for small kids,"Frankly, the place is big especially the Theme Park and overall place suits small kids more and for boys too.  Waterpark crowd is big in the morning but after 3pm is quiet.  Would be advisable to stay 1N so to comb entire place.  Day trip is too rush.",4.0
3465,Good for a short break,11 of us visited Legoland Malaysia theme park. Lots of rides to keep the kids happy and occupied for a whole day. Planning for a return visit next year and hopefully get to stay at Legoland hotel. It was fully booked for the Dec school holidays when we checked.,4.0
3466,This is the hotel for kids!,"If you are bringing kids age below 12, then staying at this hotel is a must to complete their Legoland experience. Not only you can acess to both parks easily but also you can cut the quing if you are the hotel guests.The kids will have plenty of fun inside the room itself, many surprise activities too.But, it is not cheap though. For one time experience, still worth it.",4.0
3467,Well maintained theme park with great fun!,"3/4 of the theme park for kids with 1/4 of the theme park for teenagers/adults, so set your expectation right!I would leave the attraction details unfolded - most if not all worth a try (especially kids). One of the facility I personally like are the little playgrounds keeping the kids occupied while adults are queueing up.Tips: Get your tickets online in advance (with discount!) especially during the holiday seasons. Look for any discount you may get, since the ticket for an adult is RM 140 (and the attraction hardly meet an adult's need!). Maybank credit cards offer as high as 35% discounts, and there are RM40 rebate vouchers with Petron.Bring plenty of water, it's an outdoor themepark with Malaysian weather! Bring along some snacks, tit-bits (this is really to keep adults occupied waiting in the line; the kids have got lego to play with).Bring sunscreen and umbrella (so you don't have to pay premium inside the themepark later!)Bring stroller/s (again so you don't have to rent one inside the themepark!). It's a rather big themepark, don't expect kids to walk the entire journey.",4.0
3468,Fun activities with kids,"Visited Legoland Johor Bahru on last weekend (14th December) with my family.  My 7 year old son, being an avid fan of Lego enjoyed it so much and tried everything that Legoland offered except for the waterpark.The only downside of Legoland is the entrance fees which is on the high side. Luckily there was Maybankard offer which entittles me to 35% discounted rate! ",4.0

3471,Great for kids,"My daughter is only 2 years and 8 months when we went to the legoland, so there was nothing much to do there except taking pictures here and there. We were only there for 3 hours as we don't want to miss the bus to JB sentral. So, unless you bring older children with you, i supposed this theme park was not that much fun. The souvenir there were quite expensive so we end buying nothing. Overall, it was an ok experienced for us. ",3.0
3472,"Good layout, bring a raincoat if visiting at year end","Went with 2 other families - 4 kids, all under the age of 6, and we had a blast! It rained a couple of times while we were there, but the layout of the park helped because we were never too far from shelter, or a convenience/gift store (!) where caps, umbrellas and raincoats were available for purchase if you forgot to bring your own. Lots to do... the park was very responsible and shut down some of the rides when it rained (e.g.: the faster roller coaster rides). So, be prepared to be disappointed (or at least, be prepared to queue up a few times) if you're going at year end and really want to ride the dragon roller coaster.",5.0
3473,Luv lego driving licence..!,"Promised my kid for a fun midweek break(Aug'14), so bought 2 days pass.  Too bad, it was raining on first day, so the rides stop every now and then, depending on the rain.  The thing that I found interesting is the driving school, coz not only the kid got the chance to drive lego car, but they were also being taught the traffic rules.  Once done, your kid may collect the driving licence for MYR 35.Other thing that my kid loved is the place where one can create the lego car etc.  And also the 3Da/4Dtheatre.",3.0
3474,Entertaining,A unique venue for family outing. It has dry park and wet park. Dry park is designed for family with small kids as opposed to full fledge high adrenalin rides in Universal Studio Singapore.,5.0

Lucky for us, the crowd is not too much.. maybe because the rain..We only que for 1-5minutes for every ride.We stay until the park almost close. My son loved it... this is the only theme park tat made him want to go again.. he keep asking me, when will we go back..This theme park will be boys age 4-10 favorite park.. And we will.. next time we won't miss the waterpark..See you soon Legoland...",5.0
3476,Legoland,"Went with family and frds to Legoland on a weekday, not much crowds and we do not have to queue long for rides, which is great.  I think the most exciting ride is The Dragon Ride...the rest are very mild rides.   Legoland is more suitable for younger kids, it will be bored for visitors seeking exciting and thrill rides.   The display on MiniLands, I guess due to rain and shine, the lego loses it shine and colour and could look a little dirty.   The park doesn't have much shelter, sun screen lotion is advised as I was not prepared and got sun burnt.   They could also do better with more Christmas deco as there wasn't a feel of Christmas atmosphere there.  Overall, it still a fun park for the kids.  We parked our car at the outdoor carpark and was told to pay at the machine near the carpark, many people were queuing for the one and only machine to make payment.   They should improve it with cash card payment at the exit gantry.",3.0
3477,Bring your kids,"Much has been said and there isn't much I can add to the reviews, except to remind readers that this place was built as a children's theme park, so set your expectations accordingly. The place has expanded a lot, featuring a F&B strip, hotel and water park in addition to the theme park. However, parking should really be free and bundled with the entrance fee. Some tips:1. Discounted Legoland tickets and vouchers are everywhere. You can even find them on water bottles and junk food. It'd be silly to pay full price.2. The restaurants just outside the entrance are definitely cheaper and varied than what's available inside.3. Bring an umbrella. Rain is more common than you think, any day of the year. There are a few shelters but do you really want to spend an hour or two stuck there?Bring your kids, and let them have all the fun!",3.0
3478,Legoland - A day of Fun for family,"To be honest, I was worried on the quality of fun as I had been to Disney and Universal Studio in Florida. I was soon proven wrong. It is just as good.I had a casual day, no rush to see all the rides, 1 day is sufficient. Good for kids around 7-12 years old. Best to bring your own water. it can get hot in malaysian weather, going in December might help but you run the risks of December rainy period. I decided to try for December noting that if it rains, I will head for Hello Kitty.Best to eat a good breakfast as food there is pricey, I had no choice but to spend RM 75 for family pizza lunch - I decided on the pizza restaurant because it was packed  (common sign for good food). Roast Chicken at the Kingdom Grill is at ""amazing kingdom"" price of RM 20 set. But beware, too full and the rides may make you vomit. Arriving early is important - you can park your car at Zone 3, it is nearer to the Park. It takes 15 mins to drive from hotels within 15 km away.  When I was a kid, my dad used to take me regularly to Genting for a holiday, comparing Genting rides 20-30 years ago, this is awesome. I had a difficult time to chose the hotels: Traders, Legoland, KSL, and Tune. Tune is good, please read my review on tune if you decide to drive to Tune.I am coming back? Yes, next trip is again in December in the future. How do I know? My kids voted for Legoland again.",5.0
3479,Not quite what I was hoping for,Fairly disappointing trip for me & my family. Very limited rides&sights to behold. It is even more difficult to roam around when it rains as pavement is not all concrete so it gets muddy. Ok to visit once but not to go back there again. The park also closes early.,2.0
3480,Fun Place,An excellent place for a family to spend great time together. All facilities are pretty new and in good conditions. Staffs are friendly too.The only minor setback is the food - which serving some local food may be good for both locals and foreigners.,4.0
3481,Amazing kids wonderland,"Took my kids to this lovely place for kids from toddlers to big kids! The different themed lands were wonderful and the roller coaster rides were also great even for adults. The water splash ride was wet and wild, my husband got totally drenched as he had no poncho on. Avoid the back of the ride if you can else you end up the same fate! The facilities and attractions and shops are wonderful. But the major gripe is the poor food quality and options inside the resort. The pasta was badly done and tasted worst than the ones i cooked at home with ready made sauces. We had lots of fun and look forward to going back again.",4.0
3482,Legoland Water Theme Park,"We did not have very high expectation of the theme park as it seems small from the outside. Upon entering, we were pleasantly surprised by the various rides available. It is very kid-friendly, with a min height of 107cm being set for most of the rides. My 5 year-old gal was able to enjoy all the rides together with her older brother.The lunch set combo was great too, for RM58, you get 4 drinks, 4 burgers and some sides, which is very affordable. I would highly recommend that.The downside was the weather. We went in end November, which was the start of the monsoon season, hence the rain started pouring after lunch, and all the patrons were stuck in the shelters. There were no covered walkways back to the main area, so be prepared with umbrellas if you are heading there during the monsoon season.Overall, good fun with the kids.",4.0
3483,Legoland + Legoland Waterpark = Heaven and Hell,"Going to Legoland and the Legoland Waterpark is pretty much like being in heaven and hell at the same time. Heaven is of course for Lego fans, especially the kids, will absolutely love the rides, displays, etc. No need to explain how awesome this place is.However, the place can be hell when the sun is up. It gets insanely hot, unless it's raining, which will not help either as there are not much shelters where you can seek refuge.So here are some tips for Legoland in no particular order to make your visit pleasant =)- Come early. My family (4 kids, Wifey and helper) reached there at around 10.30 am and it was already scorching hot. Also do not come during the weekends. We went there on a Tuesday during the Nov school holidays. There were quite a number of people. But we only had to wait 5-10 minutes for each ride so that's good enough for us.- Parking. I have no idea where to park, so I parked at the Medini Mall area where they charge RM$9 for the whole day. Try to park nearer to the entrance if possible.- Make sure you have a hearty breakfast/meal before you come in as food is very expensive in there. We had a huge breakfast at our hotel (Traders, awesome hotel! Stay there!) before we left for Legoland. The good thing is that they do not check your bags at the entrance so you can bring your own food and drinks. The day before I bought tons of biscuits, snacks, drinks, etc from the local supermarket cos I know the kids will be thirsty and hungry so that saved me some money haha! Oh make sure the kids bring their own water bottles filled with plain water!- Attire. I guess the best attire would be dri-fit t-shirts, bermudas and slippers due to the heat. There is one particular ride that will leave you soaking wet so the above mentioned outfit would come in handy. Also bring a poncho for the wet rides and also a small umbrella. Trust me, the umbrella would be your best friend in both the heat and rain.- Height limit. There is a height limit for most of the rides, so my 3 year old son was unable to ride some of the rides. Therefore it would be good if your kids are slightly older when they visit Legoland. Preferably 4 or 5 years and above. We bought the combo tickets so we were able to visit the waterpark on the same day. We ended visiting the theme park at around 2pm. But it rained so we had to wait at a small restaurant near the Lego Technic ride. We entered the water park at around 3pm. Here are some pointers to take note.- Bring your own towels! You have to buy a towel there for RM$20 with an additional refundable deposit of RM$20. So total is RM$40 for a towel. I forgot about the towels, so I ended up  buying only 1 towel at the gift shop and everyone shared that 1 towel LOL!- We did not use their locker system as my wife did not swim so she took care of our belongings. I think you have to pay for their lockers, not sure how much though.- Make sure you get your kids, especially young girls, to change IN THE CHANGING ROOM/TOILET and not in the locker area! I saw many irresponsible parents asking their kids to change at the locker area in the presence of other people. - Pray for clear skies. We only spent about an hour and a half when the skies turned dark. Then the thunders came and that long whistle blow from the lifeguards means that is the end of your visit there. If it was not raining, the park would be equally awesome. The kids and adults alike would really love it! Infact we're going to come back next year just for the water park and maybe stay at the Legoland Hotel during the March school holidays.- Bring your sunscreen for obvious reasons. Leave your floats and what not at home. The water park is awesome enough. Oh and don't forget your goggles!So remember to drink lots of water and pray for good weather and your trip to Legoland theme/water park would be a blast!",4.0
3484,Christmas at Legoland,"We had lower expectation on the theme park since we heard there wasn't much things to do. However, it was wrong! We were travelling with kids, aged 2 & 5yrs. Double / Single strollers are available for rent. Imagination (Duplo) area are more suitable for younger kids, while most of the other rides are suitable for my elder kid. There are both outdoor and indoor activities for each area. Queue was short (almost no queue) so it was great. But there is a ride with just four cars working, so was wondering if the crowd picked up, how can it handle? Since it's Christmas period, there are a few stage shows (but no Live Santa?) We also visited the water theme park which was also the plus point to our visit. The water playground was fun for both of my kids. Overall, 1.5 days wasn't enough for us since the kids need to recharge their energy from noon nap.. Wish we could be there for one more day or the park can consider to extend the rides / water play to 1-2hrs.. Apart from that, we do hope that there are a few more stage shows or live bands around the park which could make the environment livelier. Do expect unpredictable weather (scorching heat / heavy thunderstorm) and plan your trip accordingly. Some rides & waterpark is closed during heavy rain and tickets are not refundable. Food in the park is acceptable (not great) but do expect higher pricing. a bottle of mineral water (500ml) cost at RM3.",4.0
3485,Had lots of fun! Loved it so much,Me and my sisters went there from KL. We spent  around 4 hours in legoland and the rest of the time for the waterpark!.  I will go there again!. We took many pictures and I think people should spend two days  if they wanna go to waterpark. One day is definitely not enough as you will take a lot of pictures in legoland. We went there on weekday and there were not many people.,5.0
3486,Truly a child's dream place,"Fun, and very very well designed for kids aged 4-12. The rides will cater to most kids taller than 110cm. Only 3-4 rides require your kid to be taller than 120cm.My favourites were the dragon roller coaster ride, and the juniour driving school.The brickshop is most certainly the most interesting to an adult Lego Enthusiast. The wet park is quite small, but the activities there are fun for the whole family.My kid w",5.0
3487,Adequate for a day,"The park size and the plays/rides that it offer was rather limited compared to other theme park, especially if compared to the 'nearby' Universal Studio Singapore, but it was quite adequate for a day visit and it does cater for young kids and few attraction for big kids. For avid lego and Star Wars fan, the visit to the Star Wars Miniland is a must.Been in equatorial area, expect the place to be hot and humid. One could be drenching sweating under the direct hot sun. So perhaps alternating between indoor and outdoor (and also with some water sport game) will help to get away, for awhile, from the burning sun.When we were there, there wasn't that many visitor. So there were hardly any queue for the ride/game. We were even able to have a continouos ride on the roller coster (without need to re queue). And that really an experience that couldn't be found in other theme park, but of cause it was not a school holiday that time.",3.0
3488,"Uncrowded, top notch theme park experience","We visited Legoland Malaysia from Singapore on a Wednesday in November, and it was the most empty I've even seen any major theme park be.  That means that we never waited in line for any of the rides until about 2 pm when the school groups showed up.  We headed to right after entering the park, and did the drivers' licenses first to ensure the kids got that opportunity.  You have to pay extra to get their actual printed licenses, but as this was our first trip to any Legoland, we opted to do it.  We ate an early lunch after that.  Food prices in the park are very reasonable, and the food was fantastic!  The customer service in the restaurant was also quite incredible.  We had staff members offering to help us carry our trays, bringing us our chosen drinks, etc.  We filled the rest of the afternoon with rides, which was easy since there were no lines!  The roller coasters are short, but thrilling for our young kids.  When the kids were ready for some down time, we took them to the Build and Test center of the Lego Imagination area.  They stayed in there for about an hour, until we decided to go see a movie in the Lego Studio.  A tip for the movie: Try to sit on the left side of the theater (as you look at the screen) to experience the most of the 4-D action.  Maybe the sprayers in the middle were broken during our visit, but our kids were disappointed that they didn't get to feel the ""snow"" and such.  One of the last rides we tried was the Dino Island ride.  That's the longest line we waited in, as well, since they weren't filling the boats in order to allow groups to go only with each other.  To make matters worse, kids were cutting in line with their groups like crazy, so we spent way too long on a ride that we weren't impressed by anyway.  It's quick, and not very exciting.  But be forewarned: you will get DRENCHED.  And the body dryers in this area were broken (and rather expensive anyway), so we had to dry out the old fashioned way.  At the end of the day, the kids' favorite rides were in Lego Technic (Project X and Wave Racers) and Kingdom (Dragon and Dragon Apprentice) areas.  Our kids are ages 8 (boy), 7 and 5 (girls).  We took the shuttle offered through the Legoland website from the Singapore Flyer that morning.  We took the earliest departing shuttle from Singapore and the latest departing shuttle from Legoland that evening to allow the most time at the park.  The shuttle experience was wonderful--especially considering the convenience it offered.  We loved Legoland Malaysia!  It was the kids' favorite part of our Singapore vacation, beating out both the Singapore Zoo and Night Safari.",5.0
3489,Marvellous,Great getaway for the kids. Lots of games provided to make them excited and happy at the lobby. Fantastic -well designed rooms with disco music lights lifts that really make them busy dancing all the way. Friendly staffs with smiling faces and fast check in and out at the receptionist counter. Only if the service during breakfast could be improved. Keep up with the good service. ,4.0
3490,Excellent place for families,"We went on a public holiday but somehow the crowd was not too large. The place is large with ample parking space - however there is additional charge for the car park.The games and rides are a balance between young children and teenagers/adults so there's something for everyone. Hardcore theme park goers maybe slightly disappointed as the park is generally for families.One day was not quite enough but we enjoyed the time we spent there. There are company photographers who would snap photos of you and at the end of the day you can buy the prints off them (and download the soft copies later).There are plenty of options for restaurants and eating places, including other amenities that can be expected from such a location.An enjoyable day overall.",4.0
3491,A  Theme Park for everyone! ,"You don't have anyone to blame but yourself if you don't know how to have fun! There's no such thing the Park is only meant for children. I had a good time on the roller coasters, watching all the 4D movies which are cool and satisfying, sight seeing from the top of the moving tower, admiring the architecture buildings made from lego bricks, and climbing up and down the rope. I'm sure if you bring your partner you'll have ample time to stroll down the park while looking at the children happy faces. Yes it's great if you bring kids along, but the park is meant for everyone! Bring some snacks and a huge mineral bottle as they don't have water dispenser inside. If you want heavy meals, right outside of the park there are many restaurants.  Grab some delicious and cheap local cuisines at Johor Kitchen.",4.0
3492,A bit more effort needed,"The park is kinda boring, I understand that it is meant for little kids, but I feel that a little more effort can be put in to attract adults. Food wise is abit on the high side, expected but portion wise is just enough to fill ones stomach.The park is strictly smoke free, no smoking corner anywhere in the park, and they cant go out from the park to have a smoke because it doesnt allow re-entering. I will not visit this park again. Maybe once i have a child, i might consider.",2.0

3495,Lego land experience,Legoland Malaysia is about an hour drive from Singapore. The place is very colorful and very interesting. You will see the lego replica of some places all around the world and the color are very attractive.I would encourage people visiting the place to bring enough cover if you are going during the summer for it is quite hot due to the location near the foot of a hill and being in an open place. I think the nice time to visit the place is during the cold season.Children and adults alike will enough seeing the beautiful replicas of some very beautiful places around the world.,4.0
3496,Johor's Premier recreation park,Theme park plus waterpark offer a variety of fun-packed activities for youngsters and not-so-young alike. Screaming roller coaster riders and movie-moving children all enjoy themselves at stations of their choice. Pricing a bit on the high side for locals but the excitement and thrills were worth it,4.0
3497,Great fun for whole family,"We started our fun with waterpark. The changing room and the toilet are clean and spacious. There is locker available for rent and the rate is reasonable depending on the size.There is shower room for family too though it is not many. There is cabana for renting but the price is too pricey. Maybe the management should review the rate to hourly rate as public may opt to spend the other half day at the theme park. Also the photo price should be standard as theme park. At theme park the price of 4 photos is RM100. Other than the cabana and photo price, all the rides and games are fun and enjoy for whole family. Must come early to get good parking space and bring umbrella or raincoat in case it rains. There is not many place for shelter. Parking rate is RM9 per entry. There are also stroller for rent at the main entrance.",4.0
3498,"Best fun park, unreal fun for all","We ventured to Legoland on a day trip from Singapore. We r so glad we did. The day was fantastic.The trip doesn't take that long even when you do have to do immigration twice each way. They have it so streamlined your in and out in no time.We did a bus trip from the flyer which i think is where they all go from.We were a little skeptical travelling with a 16 year old boy and a 12 year old girl but both had an amazing day and from the kids it was the highlight of the holiday.For the older teenagers there is the dragon roller coaster and the car roller coaster, plus the smaller roller coasters.Being lego there is heaps of rides for youngsters as well.There was just a nice amount of people at the park which i think also helped and being the last ones to leave the park by the late afternoon we were just staying on rides til we felt sick of that one, then went straight onto the next!.  The food at the park was fine with plenty of variety.If you are going from Singapore the park does take Singapore dollar,  but I had a small amount of malayasian ringits  (equivalent to $50 australian) which covered lunch, drinks and snacks which I had already exchanged in Australia b4 I left. Just made it easier and the exchange rate there is alot higher.All in all we had a fantastic day.The only thing I found disappointing was I wanted to buy something unique to legoland Malaysia like the Petronas towers etc but couldnt find anything other than a photo frame that sort of looked like it. Other than that we highly recommend a day visit. Apparently the water park is good as well, we were too busy rollercoasting to find out.",5.0
3499,Suitable for kids,"To reach Legoland, we took travel bus from WTS Travel (Singapore Flyer - Legoland - Singapore Flyer), because it's more convinient (effort and time), and the price differentiation isn't so much, compare taking MRT and local bus. The journey takes around 1 1/2 hour (one way), including imigration process.If you can, please choose low season time, like we do. Queing time is very short, 5 minutes top, and for several rides, we don't have to take a queue. The ride that we like the most is the little dinasour roller coaster, 4D cinema, and LEGO diorama. To be honest, this theme park is more suitable for kids, than teenager, looking at the rides. During lunch time, we eat at restaurant outside the theme park. It's more affordable, and suitable for our taste. KFC, Burger King are some of the restaurant.The only downside of our story, the maintenance (especially the toilet) isn't as good as the park. But, it's only for several toilets, not all of them. It's still ok.",4.0
3500,It was a fun day,"As an adult I would say Lego Land is a fun place to spend a day, so for kids they must love this place!!I enjoyed being able to on all the rides - some with a line and some without. I also enjoyed the craftmanship of all the Legos here too which made a lot of nice picture opportunities. There are a few places to eat here at Legoland and I thought the food was tasty (compared to Legoland hotel's buffet).The only thing that went wrong was probably the sun being too strong and not enough places for shade. Even protecting myself with clothing and SPF I still got sunburnt near the end. But that is just a small thing.You can rent lockers for your belongings too which is nice.Also I've never been a fan of Malaysia's wet toilets so that is something for those who aren't used to it to know. The bathroom floors can be really wet sometimes, but Legoland tries their best to keep it dry with fans, but with the amount of people coming and going it is hard so please take that into consideration.",4.0
3501,Kind Legoland Hotel Staff,"This was our first family trip to Legoland yesterday and it was such an amazing first trip - especially so for our Master 2 and Master 5 who really enjoyed their time visiting the different play areas and going on plenty of fun filled rides. We were there till the theme park ended and had happily bought photographs. The whole day had been such an awesome adventure for us that we even ended up signing up for the family annual passes. However, after having dinner at Medini Mall, we discovered we had misplaced our car keys! We tried retracing back our steps everywhere and still could not locate our key. Discovering that the theme park had completely closed - it was 8.45pm, we were feeling desperate and worried as it was getting late. As an act of final desperation, we approached the Legoland Hotel Staff to assist in our prickly predicament. We were extremely fortunate to have had Encik Mohd Roslan and Mr. Ronald Pollan to attend to our car key search quest. They not only proceeded to mobilise a team to assist in searching at the various locations we could have dropped the key at; they also very kindly let us have a room for the kids to freshen up. We were very touched and grateful that they had gone to great lengths to make sure we were assisted and supported well. Our family had to travel to send us a spare key for our car and we eventually left the hotel 3.5 hours later at 12.30am. We are still waiting for news about our lost keys but thanks to the hospitality we had received and the kind gesture by both Roslan and Ronald during our short few hours at the hotel, we will never forget what they did for us when we were really desperate for help. We won't let this deter us from returning to such a magical place and would recommend Legoland to all. Special thanks to all, especially Legoland Hotel staff who were on duty yesterday. Big thanks! ",5.0
3502,"OK, but the little ones love it!","We took our 5 year old to Legoland whilst visiting Singapore. We took the bus which departs from the Singapore Flyer (earliest 8.30am) which was an easy trip. Just remember to take your passports for the border crossing. No-one actually checked that we had ours with us so not sure what would have happened if we didn't. Border crossing can be a bit tedious as you have to get off the bus twice and go through immigration twice (each way!).What 5 year old doesn't love Lego, so the place is a bit mindblowing for them. I guess we were lucky in that we weren't visiting on a busy day, we didn't really have to queue for any of the rides all day.Highs, the watersplash gets you wet (drenched), the dragon roller-coaster and the technics car roller-coaster.Lows, the park looks a bit tired in places and I think some of the rides could be better executed (like Universal or Disney) but what do I know, ask a 5 year old...Everything is Awesome!I would say that for kids much older than 6/7 there isn't really much to suit them. Perfect for 3-6 year olds.We had done everything we wanted to by the time the bus was leaving at 4.15. There are later buses which would be better if it was a busy day. Back to Singapore about 6pm.",3.0
3503,Awesome !!,"Visited legoland Malaysia in November 2014 , although it was the school holidays for both Malaysia and Singapore, the amount of people is quite little , which is a plus ! We get to ride many attractions several times without any queue , even the main attraction : the dragon . I would say the rides are mostly for children , however , being an adult myself I can say I thoroughly enjoyed many of the rides . As the name suggest , legoland is indeed filled with many figures made of lego , especially in the mini land where landmarks of different countries are made using lego , it was really impressive . Lego figurines can be found all over the theme park , which are great for taking pictures, don't forget the newly opened Star Wars attraction . Moving on to the staff , they were all very friendly and helpful , they tried their best to engage us in the mood which was certainly appreciated . The amenities in legoland is fine , toilets were quite clean , and the food are up to standard and within our budget ( about rm 22 for a set meal of pasta and drink ) . It was worth the trip and money , I would recommend a whole day trip for the theme-park, although do remember to bring your sunblock, umbrella and raincoat as the weather is unpredictable and there aren't much shelter nor shady areas being an outdoor theme-park !",5.0

3509,"Worth the penny, time and distance travelled","To get to Legoland Malaysia, there are several options and we chose the one that would consume the longest time and distance at around 400km, from KL to Johor Bahru at approximately 5hours one way but its worth because we availed the Causeway Link Coach at RM 57 per pax per 1 way. We felt comfortable throughout our journey slugging on our seats and the greenery and express way.We had 1 stop over after 2hours. We left KL at exactly 7am at Royale Bintang Hotel and returned by 6:30am.  To prevent hassles, pls book on line for causeway and Legoland provides discount for online bookers ( we saved 300 pesos ), we availed the COMBO one day pass which will have us enjoy both the waterpark and theme park. We spent most of the time at the Miniland which features the famous landmarks in Asia including the Philippines and our jeepney. The Petronas tower was built using around 500,000 bricks and it looks real. We were truly amazed taking pictures which looked real in pictures. However, the Ts and Souvenirs cost an arm and a leg.  For those who love swiiming, they can enjoy te waterpark and its amenities and slides. WHile The theme park has 4D for those who wanted to watch and a lot of rides for kids. Its hot because it lacks shaded trees. Other options would have to be coming from Singapore if one arrives in SG and take the coach and immigration or book a flight via Airplane Air asia from KL to Johor Bahru in 45minutes.",5.0
3510,AWESOME again!,We love this place. Came last year for a day trip and decided to do it again and stay at the hotel this time. So glad we did. We spent 2 days at the park and enjoyed it thoroughly. The park was quiet as it wasn't school holidays just yet so we managed to do some rides 5 or 6 times. All the staff were friendly and helpful and great with the kids. We hired a single stroller for 15 RM (discounted because we stayed at the hotel). We especially enjoyed the brick shop and picking our pieces of lego to purchase and making out own lego men to purchase for souvenirs. The food we ate was all excellent from the pizza at the Italian restaurant at the back of the park near the undercover playground and the waffles at the cafe near the entry and the chicken and rice at the restaurant near kiddie land. The toilets were all clean and cool thanks to the air conditioning being pumped in by big fans. We had a fabulous time and didn't tire of the rides. We especially appreciated having 2 days to leisurely stroll around the park and revisit our favourite rides. Us grown ups liked the racing car roller coaster and the water splash ride and the kids loved Merlin's challenge and the racing cars. Let's just say that we were blown away by the STAR WARS exhibit. Not to forget the lego city in the center of the park. Shame there's no shade as the hot sun put people off from spending too much time exploring this part of the park. After 2 trips (total of 3 days) to Legoland park we would happily visit again.,5.0

Other than that the rest are as described by many in this link.My kids 2, 4 and 6 enjoyed the dragon roller coasters rides and build your on Lego race cars to race with other kids indoor.

3512,ho-hum,"I skipped the border from Singapore on a day trip to check out what all the fuss was about in JB!It's an easy process to get there, especially on a private tour bus. But if not, there is a bus that runs from outside Legoland theme park to Immigration, and then another bus running from the Singapore side to the MRT stop.Legoland itself is on the smaller side, but there is enough to do for a few hours. Given, I don't have children, a lot of the rides would appeal to them more, there is really only one rollercoaster that I think adults would enjoy.Miniland was fantastic, the craftsmanship that has gone into replicating worldwide monuments is astounding.If you are two adults, I would try and get cheap tickets and advise that you only need half a day..You can pay in SGD, which is super handy, but you will of course get the change back in MYR. There is a little shopping centre next to the hotel with a few fast food type restaurants, but you can't exit and re-enter the actual park.Beware that in monsoon season, rides may shut down due to safety concerns, rendering your visit useless.",3.0
3513,Everything is Awesome!!,"We recently went to LEGOLAND in Malaysia on our family holiday.  It was nothing short of awesome!  The attractions there were fantastic - from the water park, to Mini Land of Lego architect and the rides.All of the staff were fabulous, so friendly and helpful.  The staff around the park were so much fun and made a point to stop and talk to people, you could go up and ask assistance and nothing was too much trouble.  We had staff in the caf√© help us to our seat with our tray of food and then come back with cutlery, etc for us - just so helpful.We spent two days at LEGOLAND and I must admit that we loved every minute of it.  We were unfortunate enough to be caught in a massive thunderstorm for just under 2 hours there (everything shuts down during rain & lightening except the shops, cafes and a few attractions that are indoors!) so we lost time to spend doing outside attractions.  In the end we had to rush to do things and still didn't' get to do everything we wanted to do.   The first day we spent at the water park - a day is a good amount of time so you can enjoy it because the water slides are great fun and you can spend quite a bit of time on them!  The height restrictions aren't too bad - my 5 and 7 year olds could go on most of the water slides (some needed an adult) but my 3 year old missed out on them however there is a wave pool which she was more than happy to play in and there's also the big water play area with smaller water slides and the lego river where you an build your own lego raft that is for all ages.  We stayed at the hotel the night, which made the experience all the better - highly recommend doing that if you can!The next day we did the dry stuff.You can hire strollers there which we did for our 3 year old so she didn't get tired of walking.  It was a small fee to hire, but well worth it.The food at the park was pretty good and not too expensive.  We ate at the restaurant and found the food and area really quite good.Highly recommend for all of the family.  I think we'll be going back there again!",5.0

From Singapore its around 3 to 4 hours by Private Tour Bus which included passing thru immigration.We choose the water-park since we have been to a lot of rides and it seems to lack the thrill and adrenaline rush.Since I have been to Adventure Cove, Sentosa; I was not very amazed nor was too pumped. Legoland and Adventure Cove almost have the same slides, however in my opinion the latter is better (which included a snorkeling area, a real wave pool with a man-made beach).Otherwise we were able to spent a fun-filled Deepavali.",4.0
3516,Best hotel with best service in malaysia,"Liked: superb service and staffs, cleanliness, children friendly, whole lobby is a play ground. Never expect a malaysia hotel to have such superior service! Never experienced such well trained staffs too. Their english are very good. Rooms with treasure hunt to occupy kids time. love it when they section the room into 2. Dislike: Expensive. A price you get for such superior service, worth it!",5.0
3517,Lego fun for all ages,"We took our children here with a tour from Singapore. Great day out with the kids and plenty to do and see for all ages. As with previous reviews there isn't a lot of shade around so take a hat and sunscreen and consider booking a ticket for both Legoland and the water park so you can cool off. Kids enjoyed the train ride around Legoland, the 3D Lego movie and a number of rides. They weren't big enough for all the rides but still plenty to fill out a day. Lots of food options around the park too. A highlight for us was our 1yr old being serenaded with 'Twinkle Twinkle little star' by a group of musicians who were going around the tables of diners at lunch time and playing for them. If you're traveling from Singapore bring your passport and have your documents in order and arrival/departure cards filled out before you get to customs as it was a bit of a rush with bus loads of tour groups arriving at the same time. Would recommend for families.",5.0
3518,Fantastic place for an outing for kids with kids at heart!,"Visited with my son and daughter 4+,2 1/2. Plenty of activities for both, but best for kids over 4 (at least over 90cm in height).But the both had a wonderful day. Be back for sure, frequently!Easiest way to get there is to fly to Singapore and drive down or catch a tour bus. Arrange for Malaysian visas according to rules applicable to you ahead of time.",5.0
3519,"""Legoland"" I will see you next 3 years times","With the the surrounding areas still under-developed, there is not much to offer here. It is a big funs for the kids but not the parents or the adults who brought them here. Give them said a 3 years times to build up all the nearby areas and you will see the different scenario.",3.0
3520,Great day,"Was a good day, didn't do the water park. Very hot, not much shade. Kids had a great time. Lego no cheaper than in Australia - take photos of prices on your phone to compare there. Would not want to be there on a busy day. ",4.0
3521,Well worth a visit.,"Loved Legoland. The place a huge and the rides lots of fun with variety for all ages. Prices inside Legoland very reasonable and shopping at the end of the day in the Lego store is a must! Yep it's hot but not unbearable and some areas are air-conditioned. Left Singapore on the coach with WTS at 9.30 am and came back on the 4.15pm coach and that was barely enough time to see and do everything! Don't bother trying to do the dry park and the wet park on the same day, I think you'd run out of time. In hindsight probably should have booked a night at the Legoland hotel to do both. Well worth the day trip. ",5.0
3522,Not The Best Legoland,"Having been to the other Legolands in Germany and the US, I am compelled to review Legoland Malaysia from a comparative perspective.  As in all Legolands, there is the water theme or channel park, the Mindstorm play area and the theme park.  The difference with this is that it offers Asian themes and landmarks.  I will not write about the ticket types, or ideal parking spots, or best times to avoid cross-border congestion.  Inspite of the multi-coloured and multi-shaped Lego blocks that are a familiar sight in this Legoland as well as in others, somehow I feel there is something missing.  If I can pen it down to a single factor, I think it is the people factor.  To my mind, Lego play is about a certain system of philosophy and value by way of exploring how our world works.  It also encourages creativity and team work through play.  It is about making others joyous and purposeful.  I can feel a sense of embrace and ownership of the Lego philosophy in those other Legolands.  In this place, I get the nudge that the people who works there just treat their role as another job.  So who is this Legoland for ?1) Legoland fans who had been to the other 6 locations and wanted to collect a Legoland Malaysia ticket or stamp as a round-up memorabilia2) Parents who wants to bring their kids for a day of fun.  Legoland becomes the baby-sitter.3) Folks who want to boast or avoid embarrassment that they had not been to Legoland MalaysiaIf you have other options to explore in Malaysia, then Leogland Malaysia is not for you.  The humidity will depress you.  The forthcoming rainy season will be a fair bit of downpour.  Have a clear objective and a plan why you want to go.",3.0
3523,it's for the whole family,"We explored the themepark in the morning and continued at the waterpark in the afternoon.  We had a blast. Since we were there early during a Monday.  There wasn't much crowd.  We had the park to ourselves.  Good thing it rained or else, we wouldnt be able to tour all of it becuase the weather was scorching hot.  We were in our rashguards and boardshorts while exploring the themepark.  So, we were not interrupted with our tour as it rains. haha! ",5.0
3524,Suitable for kids,"We visit this theme park in May 2014. The entrance fee was quite expensive. Well, aside from a lot of Lego miniature, this park offers less than other theme park such as Dunia Fantasi Jakarta and Universal Studio SIngapore. My parents were bored and decided to go back to hotel earlier than us. The park is not very big, we finished our tour in 2 hours. One great thing about this place is the merchandise shop. It's a bit expensive but very tempting. I think one visit is enough.",3.0
3525,Good enough,Rides are litlle less than usual theme parks I have been too. However there are at least 3 roller coaster ride with different level. Not much shade and weather is very hot with no winds. Plus points are the legos built in the center of the park which represents Asian Cities.,3.0
3526,Great Water Theme Park,The new water theme park is great! Staff is great and friendly! Family and individuals can all enjoy the new attraction.,5.0
3527,Excellent!,The park has improved a lot since our first visit in 2012. We didn't have time to visit the water themed park as we were so occupied exploring the dry park in 2 days. Loved the new Starwars Lego centre and everything else. Will definitely visit again in future.,5.0
3528,Great time at Legoland!,"Visited Legoland over the Halloween weekend and had a great time. We arrived at 10.30am and surprisingly there was plenty of car park lots at Zone 3 (RM$9 per entry). This car park  is just next to the Mall of Medini. If you are going to Legoland  on weekdays, parking at the car park of the mall is cheaper. Otherwise, please park at the Legoland car parks which is flat rate RM$9.There was no queue to buy tickets and needless to say - very short or no queue for rides in the park! :)The parks was very clean & toilets 6* clean and dry with toilet paper. The food outlets were clean & delicious with reasonable prices ( RM$20 per pax) and people friendly.The trees have grown and we had wonderful weather. The rides caters for all ages and there are several games stalls too!",5.0
3529,A great holiday destination for the young kids & adult Lego fanatics,"The theme park is really built with the child in mind. For the adults, the enjoyment comes from seeing the kids having fun. Lego fans should keep themselves updated on LLM's events as there are promotions organised around the year, e.g. exclusive Lego merchandise, gifts with purchases, festive events with prizes to be won. The Water Park is also fun for the kids. Rides in both parks are not definitely not the hair-raising kind. Thrill seekers need not bother coming here lest you be disappointed. On all my visits (my family goes twice a month on average), the staff members are very friendly & helpful. They are not representative of the customer service you tend to get in most places in Malaysia, if you get my drift.PS. For the mums & dads who may be considering bringing their electronic gadgets to the park - you will be hard pressed to find a socket to charge up your gadgets & there are no WiFi spots. In fact, phone reception is weak in some areas. After all, we are talking about an area that is still being developed and will not see much inhabitants for the next 5 years, at least. You have been warned.",4.0
3530,Great family day(s) out,"We had a combo ticket (water park and theme park proper), but it was way too much to do on a single day; you can easily spend a full day at each. Our kids (1.5 and 4 years old) both enjoyed the water park, which has something for all ages. The slides in particular are excellent. The Legoland theme park itself is also much bigger than I expected. There isn't much for the smaller one there, but our 4-year-old had a great time there too. Despite this being a Sunday, it was practically empty (on every ride they asked, would you like to go another round?) We'll be back!",5.0
3531,Must Visit,"As a non-Lego fan, I was persuaded to come here for my son who is an avid Lego fan.  Not expecting to enjoy myself, I was extremely surprised by how much fun I had here!  The rides were  excellent, manned by very polite and professional staff.  The exhibits were really impressive, featuring a lot of Asia's beautiful spots.  Park is big and you definitely need a whole day to cover it properly.  Families with young children or even young teenagers will definitely have a fun time here.  There are a couple of mild roller coasters which is right up my alley as I don't fancy the ones that try to make you throw up.  The park is hot but there are several shaded spots and restaurants around the park where you can take short breaks in between.  We were given RM10 food vouchers with our ticket purchase and put those to good use.  We ate at the Market restaurant and enjoyed the food and service there.  Toilets are kept in excellent condition.  Try to go during non-school holiday period like we did;  no need to line up for rides and we even went several times on several rides.  Our kids enjoyed themselves very much and I'm now recommending the park to the rest of my family members who haven't been.  Very surprised that such a professionally well-maintained international themepark actually does exist in Malaysia.",5.0
3532,legoland park 2014,"i suggest you take 2 days to cover all the rides/water works in a peaceful and relaxing manner.legoland park itself can be covered in a day, quiet a few awesome rides for the kids...adult may find it abit too gentle.waterpark is good. hope they can maintain it. the slides n river fantastic. afew rides cater for wheelchair though...saw some lift but never get chance to try....kids love this place....surely",4.0

Legoland have 2 parks to be explored, themed park and water park. We started our journey at themed park for the whole morning. Afternoon, we explore the water park. Overall we had a great weekend spending time here. However, 1 day for 2 parks was a bit rush for us. If you plan to spend more time here, Legoland Hotel also welcomes you with interesting themed rooms...",3.0

3535,Great family entertainment for a Day,"We took our youngest daughter to Legoland, to give her the experience by visiting a great Entertainment Park.We arrived on a sunny morning in November 2014, noticing it is not busy.All rides are included in the price. You need to pay for the small games in the stalls, all priced at RM10.00 per game. It is a comfortable stroll through the compound with fun for everyone. I would not suggest to bring along kids below 4 years, but if others come along it is a great day of fun for the whole family. Plenty of restaurants with fast food type of food, or if you feel like having a good cup of tea, there is plenty of aircon indoor places.Overall: recommended for kids up to age of 12 years, others might find it a bit boring.Super clean toilets and good amenities! A job well done!",5.0
3536,Good fun for kids and adults too!,We visited during the June school holidays (on a Monday). I was prepared for long queues but was pleasantly surprised that it was not as crowded as I thought it would be. Most rides are suitable for kids above 6 years. All 3 kids (ages between 6 to 10) in our group had a great time as they were able to get on all the rides.The park needs more tall and leafy trees to provide shade from the scorching sun. We were very lucky to have visited on a rather gloomy and cool day but do be prepared with hats and sunblock.Staff were generally polite and helpful.Food at Pizza Mania was quite good. Bought our tickets online in advance at a discount. ,4.0
3537,Feeling like a kid again,"The whole family loved Legoland, parents and kids alike. The theme park is best for 6-13yr olds, as older kids may want more thrill rides. The water park is fun for everyone.Staff are super friendly and helpful, and are obviously enjoying their work. It really adds to the experience.We went on Thursday and Friday and there were no queues or congestion, it may not be as much fun on weekends.2 day pass allowed us to see all of the parks and have some rest breaks. It could be done in a day weather permitting. It is very hot all year round and there are often afternoon storms - many rides closed early for a storm the first day we were there.You can buy food and drinks from the nearby mall, but the quality is ok inside and the price reasonable for a theme park.Our hotel linked tickets allowed early entry, but it wasn't important as most rides weren't started anyway.Tip - head for the Technic roller coaster first to beat the crowd, then to the back of the park where you will be on your own for a couple of hours. On the weekdays we were there we could keep going on many rides without having to line up again. It's the same in the water park, with only 1 or 2 rides having any queue at all and those were only a few minutes long.Our Lego fan family with kids 8 and 11 loved every minute.",5.0
3538,Legoland Johor Bahru,"good theme park, very educative but its very hot, need more trees and bench, and free drinking water fountains  ",4.0
3539,In between average and Very good,"We went to lego land Morning of November 2, I was really excited because I have been wanting to visit the place since years back. When we got there we tried different rides and saw different attractions, there were staffs in character which made the visit more exciting. I can say if you are a lego fanatic, you will really love the place coz' I have. There are a lot of displays which really amazed me, face of Albert Einstein, Star Wars characters, Asia's best tourist spots all made of lego and also some few rides for adult and several for kids and kids at heart.  But maybe it was the planning or facilities that hinder a ""perfect"" amusement park experience. The park is too big and the zones are quite scattered, plus there were no shed at all so you have to bare the heat of the sun. Also, the direction inside the park were quite unreadable, maybe because it was too big? And if you are a thrill seeker, maybe this is not the place for you, though it was really for family with young kids. With food, it was okay? normal theme park food. With accessibility, it was okay, there were many public transportation around. With the hospitality and treatment of staffs, I can say they are better than other attractions in Singapore and Malaysia, they were  hospitable and very helpful also, toilet were very clean.",4.0
3540,This was one of the exciting visits to the newly opened Legoland and very professionally maintained and family friendly,"A must visit , however this is ideal for family with kids below 16 requires one full day of enthralling amusement park, made of ever popular Lego toys It is beautifully kept and has some interesting rides, games to cherish.book your tickets in advance for a experience you shall remember.We enjoyed rides , photo clicks and would surely want to visit again as its expanding.It is closer from Singapore too as Johar Bahru , is a 4-5 hour drive from Kualalumpur",4.0

3542,Awesome WEEK day out!,"Having heard of long queues on weekends, we decided to visit on a weekday (wed) and literally had the whole place to ourselves. No queuing for rides and even repeated rides possible. Parking was 1 ringgit for the whole day. Variety of activities - some outdoors some indoors, to suit young kids. My 7 and 10 year olds enjoyed themselves tremendously, especially activities that allowed them to get sprinkled with water to cool down. The miniature worlds of South East Asian locations were awesome with great attention to detail - wowed the adults. Enough to occupy a full day and we didn't even get to the water park yet. Food was surprisingly good standard for a theme park - we had pastas and pizza. Toilets clean and conveniently located.  Overall a great experience and certainly worth treating ourselves to a second visit.",4.0
3543,"Theme park, best for kids and lego lovers","I love lego ! You can see a lot of lego here, from in front of the toilet, and all the way long.. There is a lot of miniatures from Lego, like Forbidden City from China, Twin Tower from Malaysia, Singapore Flyer from SG, and many more.The games are best suitable for kids, but i'm still like it :)When i was there, the queue is relatively long but quite fast compare to USS.If u want to play a water games and forget to bring an additional clothes, there is a full body dryer inside the theme park and u can find it near to water games area.There is a few food stall and lego shop inside the theme park and u can use ur SGD here, but i think u can use other currency here too like USD.",4.0
3544,my 3rd visit,"my kids can't get enough of this park. This is our 3rd visit. Eventhough it is the same game ,they still enjoy the ride. However this time around there are new attraction,the miniature on Star Wars. It is very fascinating on how they can put all the piece and the story together. Even the introduction (the story line..at the start of the tour) are very funny when they put Jar Jar Bink as the main attraction.",4.0
3545,A real treat for the family,"Spent my hubby's birthday here and it was a real amusement for my children! The rides were awesome. They really enjoyed all the wonderful lego creations inside the park. Although, it was kinda hot going around the park, it outweighed all the excitement they felt with just everything inside it. The two-day ticket combo was all worth the penny! Been also to a lot of theme parks but so far this has been the choice of my kids and best ever according to them. The park was not too crowded when we went there so my children had the time of their lives in and out of the rides. We will keep on coming back here!",5.0
3546,Awesome for the family!,"Went with kids aged 4 and 6.  At that age, my kids could go on and do practically all of the attractions. Tips: Food inside is amusement park food. Nothing great for adults. Some attractions can get you wet. It's welcoming due to heat. We enjoyed 4D movie sessions. 2 days combo tix worthwhile. Although people complain about lack of shade, lots of airconditioned restaurants and attractions you can duck into for relief. Don't carry too many things. Many rides require you to leave all your stuff on an open shelf. We had already enjoyed LEGOLAND California 2 years previously and this time around, LEGOLAND Malaysia+Hotel we enjoyed even more. In my view, a much better choice than Disneyland California experience! LEGOLAND allows even the parents to enjoy.",5.0
3547,Lego madness,"Having been to that appallingly bad theme park,Disneyland Paris, I am rather skeptical when visiting all others.To my amazement Legoland just outside of Johor Baru on the south coast of Malaysia was inspirational.We started our Journey from Perth Western Australia,took the AirAsiaX 3 and 1/2 hour flight to Bali and had some relaxing days prior to flying again on Airasia to Singapore.A few nights shopping in Singers and then a short 1hour + bus ride across one of the 2 bridges crossing the Straits of Mallaca to our Hotel in Johor Baru.BTW if you are in Johor Baru,do yourself a favour and get a curry from Village Bryani cafe 07-2220360.The best curry we have had in years.We took a taxi the short drive west of Johor Baru to legoland.The place was amazing.From the scale models of Buildings,to the talking Movie characters, to the water park-all amazing.We did the combo Adult Theme park + Water park $60 AUD each (175MYR) and Combo Child $47 AUD (140MYR)on the internet . You can get cheaper tickets from your Hotel in Malaysia.We and our 10 YO daughter enjoyed it immensely.Go early and pack a big hat,sunscreen and plenty of bottled water.It can get rather hot.Do the Theme park first and cooldown in the pool afterwards.. We caught a taxi from our hotel back to Singapore.Marginally more expensive,but less walking,changing buses etc,and priority access at the borders.We found  cheaper lego kits in other cities such as Badung in Indonesia,but they do have some specials in the lego shop.",4.0
3548,More For Kids,"The man made legos are extraordinary and captivating. Most rides are for kids. When travelling back to hotel, please find a way to get a red coloured cab instead of the blue cabs waiting by the lobby as their prices can be ridiculously high.",2.0
3549,Great Day Trip from Singapore,"We were annual visitors to Legoland in San Diego between 2006 and 2010.  My son (now 10 years old) loved every visit.  It was great to see him progress through the rides and the last time we went together in 2010, he finally was tall enough to ride Project X.  I thought that would be the end of Legoland trips.  Well my son went back in 2012 and still loved it.  So we thought it would be good to sea the South East Asian version. It was well worth the under 1 hour ride to the park from Singapore.  This one seems smaller than the San Diego version which is good because it can get very, very hot.  So the shorter distances from ride to ride.  We loved the Asian themed miniland.  Don't know what its like on a weekend but on a Friday when school is in session, my son was able to go on rides multiple times in the 4 hours we were there.  Highly recommended.",5.0
3550,Great park for kids,Kids 10 & 13 really enjoyed it. Not too busy. Rides were great for kids. Evenings and mornings are cooler. Water park is busy but excellent fun for the hot part of the day. ,4.0
3551,Amazing!,"Despite the hot weather, this place is amazing. It was fantastic to see how they built airport, cities and harbours from Lego!By the time we went there, my youngest kid got a free annual pass. Thanks Legoland.Overall, this place is recommended to visit.",4.0
3552,Legoland worth 1+ days' visit,"Went to Legoland again since it has a new water park opened.  I actually spend 3 days there and ended up buying an annual pass.  In comparison, I like Legoland's ""ride"" and activities much more than others (such as Universal or Disney), in the sense that Kids get to enjoy and participate in the activities or rides instead of just ""sit and ride.""  My kids in particular liked the build a lego car with lego and get to race with other kids.  Water park, first time there and still quite fun.  The kids were a bit exhausted thought since you have to climb the stairs to reach the top for the ride.  I enjoyed it, but not likely for both kids and adults to spend a ""Full"" day there.  We spend the better part of the day there and in the late afternoon, we went back to Legoland.However, the rides / attractions maybe more suitable for kids under 10?  Older kids may find it a bit boring?",5.0
3553,Amazing Lego Designs,"Went there summer time so it was scorching HOT! Make sure to bring umbrella, hat, sunglasses, subblock and plenty of water. There aren't many shades to hide under so wear light breathable clothes. What my 12-year old daughter and I enjoyed the most was the MINILAND. This main attraction features miniature famous landmarks from around the globe, such as The Singapore Flyer, The Forbidden Palace, The Petronas Twin Tower, The Taj Mahal and more. Some of the display has buttons, when pushed, will create sounds of moving vehicles, talking people, gush of water, etc. Then there's also the moving Observation Tower that will give you a 360 view of the whole theme park. We no longer tried some of the rides as those are most suitable for younger kids. My favorite Lego structure was that of  Einstein's head. My friend took a picture of me kissing it. Hahaha! Just being crazy. My daughter, on the other hand, adamantly purchased lego pieces suitable for girls. All along I thought legos are only designed for boys. Another amazing experience I will never forget were with the super friendly staff who are always smiling and willing to help. The park is not that big and we just consumed half of the day to go around it. There's no need to worry about food since just outside the entrance of the theme park is the Mall of Medini with lots of food establishments and other shops. I was able to purchase cheap coffee and delicacies at one of the shop there. Just beside it was the Legoland Hotel. All in all, it was a refreshing experience!",4.0
3554,Everything is awesome,"You will not be disappointed when you visit Legoland in Johor Bahru.  Everything is really well done and there were absolutely no lines when we visited.  We raced from attraction to attraction enjoying everyone with no wait.  It's very hot there, so drink lots of water!!",5.0
3555,Lego,my kids they love lego and having all the character at home and this park was of their choice it is designed for kids and they have fun no matter it was hot or expensive at least they went home happy,5.0
3556,Not fantastic but not too bad...,"Took my 2kids (a teenager + a young child) to Legoland Johor for a short break recently.  Had been pushing this trip out as was doubtful whether it's worth going. Finally made it there. Well, firstly it is indeed very hot... as expected, to be in a theme park under the hot Msian weather.  Fortunately, there were a few indoor activities - building Legos, robotic, with aircond, which allowed us to cool down a little in between all those outdoor rides.  The rides - mini roller coaster (I think it's called ""dragon""), the swinging/rotating rides (similar to those teacups in Disneyland), and most of the rides are suitable for ~5-6 years and above, although would deemed not challenging enough for the older children. My boy also enjoyed the driving school.  Under such hot weathers, I would expect many cool/cold beverages/ice-cream choices but alas, not so.  Just a few miserable ice-cream boxes stall, with limited choices.  It will be good if they build more shades or canopy to cover the walk-ways to protect against the hot sun and also rain.  Fortunately, no rain on the day I went but I don't dare to imagine how it would be if there is rain!  My boy is a die-hard Lego fan so on the whole he enjoyed it but honestly, I would not go again.  Compare to the rides/games available, I don't think RM120-150 entrance fees are justifiable.  By the way, I went to he dry park only. The staff tried hard to be cheerful, though, that, I have to give credit to them.",3.0
3557,Kids would love it here,"I went to legoland with high expectation, but I was sorely disappointed. It was too hot, there wasn't enough shaded area to hide from the sun while walking around. There weren't any water refill machine in the park, forcing you to either buy overpriced drinks. Nearly all the rides caters for kids, and would not satisfy the adults. All in all, if you have kids then this is the place to go, and IF you go with your kids do bring your own umbrella, cooling pad, lot's of water, and it's best to come early in the morning or late afternoon. When the sun is not to hot.Tips: Those from Tune hotel, there's a shuttle van from tune hotel. Buy the ticket from Tune hotel (RM110) inclusive with the return shuttle trip.Tips 2: To go to JPO (Johor premium outlet) from Legoland, there's a bus that cost RM3.90 per way. Can't remember the time. But there's a 2.45 bus. Do inquiry at the information counter for the schedule. The bus stop is located to your left when you exit Legoland, just walk until you reach a bustop.",3.0
3558,10AM-6PM is not enough.  We need more time!,"The park is open from 10AM to 6PM.    Generally, the park caters to the young ones; there are lots of rides/attractions for them.  Our 4-yr old enjoyed driving a Lego car on her own at the Junior Driving School, and she was thrilled with the driver's license that came with it.  She also had a blast at the Royal Joust and at the 3 playgrounds she got to try.  Then, there's a handful of rides for the kids at heart.  We enjoyed getting wet at the Wave Rider.  For those who can't ride,the Lego display of Asia's landmarks gave us tons of photo opportunities.  So, there's really something for everyone.  However, due to the limited park hours, we weren't able to try everything the park offered :/  The park should extend their operating hours.  Other tips: We bought our tickets online a week in advance and got them at discounted rates! We went on a weekday so the queue was very manageable.  Wear cool, comfortable clothing and sunscreen because the weather could be unforgiving; hot one moment, then rainy the next (it poured about mid-afternoon when we were there).  Bring an umbrella for added protection from the sun & rain.  Bring a face towel to wipe your sweat.  Bring a change of clothes if you plan to ride the ones that have a water feature because you will get wet, but if you aren't able to bring clothes, the park provides body dryers for a fee, though...or you could buy their merchandise, if you don't mind splurging.  We were allowed to bring in bottled water (500ml), but once we finished drinking them, we had to buy potable water.  The park doesn't provide water fountains with potable water, so you'll have to buy your drinking water if your supply runs out.",4.0
3559,Ideal for 4-10 year olds,"While I love the fact that the lines were short the place did not offer much for younger childern which was a disappointment.

3560,Great for young kids,My 4 years can now take all the rides and she loves thsi place.Went on monday and it was awesome with no queue and completely empty park.

3561,Thursdays great day to visit,"Visited as part of wts travel tour, my husband is a big Lego fan so loved it.  Rides are mostly kid orientated but we had a heap of fun.  Only thing that soured it was 4D movies got cancelled due to mechanical issues on the ride next door.  Park was Empty on a Thursday!  Food and other items inside the park are very well priced - coming from Australia we were pleasantly surprised. ",4.0
3562,OMG !!,"the entrance fee was sky high , and inside got nothing to play just sight seeing ! and all the display dirth and aging, but better than nothing to see.",2.0
3563,Super small,took us less that 1 and a half hours to go around the park...They couldnt have made it much smaller..Very disappointed,4.0
3564,Wonderful,One of the popular destination for tourist and Malaysian.  Kids will be enjoy the park.  Its worth to visit as it is the 1st Asia Legoland.  The duty staff could be better by showing cheer and active in create fun to visitors.,4.0
3565,Family trip to legoland,"My family had a great time in the theme park and the water park. The large Lego sculptures of dinosaurs,  giraffes and others around the park were awesome. The Star Wars reenactment was breathtaking. My kids enjoyed making their own racing cars and racing them. The rides were good. There was not much waiting time. The slides in the water park were fabulous. We totally enjoyed them. Ample locker space. Nice large clean bathrooms, changing rooms and toilets. Food and drinks were reasonably priced. Everything well spaced out. Nice and friendly staff who were helpful. We enjoyed the water park. All in all, we had a wonderful day. It was worth every penny, seeing how my kids enjoyed themselves.",4.0
3566,"Miniland worth the trip, but expensive","The place mainly caters to Singapore residents and tourists given the expensive prices, though we realized that substantial subsidies were available to Malaysians in order to make it slightly more affordable.  Miniland is worth the trip as it is always impressive to see how much can be done at 1/20 scale with Lego bricks, and how realistic it can be.  StarWars attraction (which had just opened) was great for the fans, but just ""worth seeing"" for others.  The rest is just an expensive, medium-sized amusement park with vague reference to Lego.  Will I go back?  Not if the Miniland section is not expanded.  Would you go just for the amusement park?  Maybe if you are a Singapore resident want to get wet elsewhere than in Sentosa, ready for the relatively long journey and relatively expensive prices...",3.0
3567,Super Fun,"This place is absolutely fun for both adults and children. We visited last Oct 17 and it was scorching hot and rained in the afternoon. Roller coasters were closed right before the rain poured.They don't accept US dollars in their store, so make sure you either have RM or SGD if you need to purchase anything from their food/souvenir store.",5.0
3568,"Awesome, my 7 year old loved it..","We stayed at the Lego Hotel for 3 nights and had 2-day passes to Legoland and water park. The parks were not crowded at all. I don't think we waited any longer than 5 minutes for any rides.  The rides are mostly designed for the little ones. A 2-day pass is just about right amount of time we needed for this venue. The best thing is that we were staying at the Lego Hotel, so we can go back to the hotel when it is too hot during the day and came out again in the afternoon. There is a 'mall' right next to the Legoland where you can find eateries with yummy food (very cheap too) and a couple convenience stores.",5.0
3569,Aging,"We first visited the park in December 2012. Almost 2 years later, on our second visit, we find the park showing signs of age. The static displays were no longer spic-and-span. They look tired and in need of a serious, massive scrubbing or cleanup. Some of the moving legos in Miniland back in 2012 are no longer working. Some displays are in troubled state, like that collapsed house in the Bolinao, Philippines static display.The good stuff:- Consider us lucky but the bus ride via WTS to Legoland went smoothly. No traffic at all. Travel time took to Legoland took only 1 hr 5 mins.- Consider us lucky 2nd time around, there were hardly any crowd when we visited. And it was a Sunday! The longest time we had to queue for a ride was probably 5 minutes, and it was for the Nissan Junior Driving School. Rest were almost instantaneous -- to the point the we didn't have to alight a roller coaster ride just to ride it again (nobody was in the queue!)- The newly opened Star Wars Miniland was really really great.",3.0
3570,MY KIDS LOVED IT!,"We family of 4 visit to legoland on late September. It wasn't crowded at all when we got there. Making it more enjoyable as the queue was never longer than 5 minutes. Even my kids can take the same roller-coaster for 5 times :) !Some reviewer said not enough place to shade but on the contrary we found that there are lots of available sheltered chairs. Just prepare hat, umbrella and sun tan when you get there :)During our visit some of the rides were shut down due to afternoon storm :(Afterall, we loved this new theme park ...",5.0
3571,Loads of fun but HOT,Our family had a lot of fun here. We got a two day pass in conjunction with a stay at the Legoland Hotel (which we loved!) and had a great time. Being a weekday we struck no queues & were able to go on rides as many times as we like. It is very much a ride theme park without the professionalism and excellent shows you get at Disneyland and as such I wouldn't like to have paid full price for each day. But as a two day discounted package it was a fun way to finish a holiday. The rides are probably for up to 12 year olds & not really exciting enough for older kids but our 13 year old still loved it!,4.0
3572,HOT!,"Don't bother visiting if you hate the heat and humidity.   They have done nothing since they opened to address the heat.  Nothing!  Waste of money and worse, time. The heat saps your energy and drains any fun that can be had.   They even try to capitalise on the heat and charge you insult pricing for food and beverage and little gadgets that spray water.   Go visit Genting highlands, sunway lagoon, a famosa resort etc.",2.0

3577,Great fun times for young and old,"Had a great time at Legoland and the water park. If you have any facsination with Lego then you will love this place. The Star Wars exhibition was amazing as well was mini Legoland. Staff are the water park were great, even when they had to shut down the rides due to a thunder storm.If you are coming from Singapore, there is too much to do in one day if you combine Legoland and the water park. If you want to do both, then I would recommend you spend overnight at the Legoland Hotel.",5.0
3578,AN UNFORGETABLE EXPERIENCE,"Wow, wow, wow, regardless if you are a lego lover/enthusiast or not, visiting Legoland should be on your itinerary if you are visiting Singapore or Malaysia.  The water park is SO much fun also and I would buy tickets for both (at the same location).",5.0

3580,Great choice for young child,"This is the second time I went to Legoland with my 6 years old boy. The first time is in California. When compared to Legoland in California, Malaysia Legoland is more or less the same. Almost the same decor, same rides... The betters things in Malaysia Legoland is it looks brand new as it opened for around 1 year only. The waterpark here is bigger. More importantly, there are less crowded! I spent more than one hour lining up in California to let my boy drive the lego car for 15 mins. Here, we only spend few mins to get to any rides. It made a huge difference! My boy enjoyed himself very much indeed. The best part to me and him is playing inside the waterpark. Get wet, have fun!",5.0
3581,Awesome experience,"A wonderful day with kids. They enjoyed every moment. Rides are very well kept, toilets are unexpectedly clean and staff helpful.  ",5.0
3582,"It's Ok, wouldn't recommend it.","So many great reviews on here. And yes, the mini Lego land is great. The staff are friendly. The rides are ok, for under 12s. My kids are 6+4, and they love'd it. The bus trip from Singapore is a bit of a effort, and yes, the difference between Malaysia and Singapore is VERY evident. Con's, no shade, and we are from Australia, we can deal with heat, but it really does just beat down on you. Food variety, not the best. Sorry. Locker, didn't work. Asked for our money back- they said no. My phone was taken off our table as we were eating, yes the staff went to ALOT of trouble to find it. But to no avail. Lego store was ok. Bus ride home at peak hour, took 1hr to get through customs in the lines. Dragging everything off the bus and in again, 4 times, no thanks. Sorry- I really wanted to like this place, but we wish we had of just stayed in the hotel by the pool. (Would be $300 richer) also the bus company were not very friendly. WT or something like that. ",2.0
3583,Went on weekdays non-holiday time. Great!,"We went on normal Wed and Thur on the school day, so there were hardly people in the park.  Great!The new Star Wars inside display was impressive. Food was ok.  The price was probably high-end for the local, but it was not too bad for Australian standard.  There were a few different restaurants inside.  As people mentioned, there were hardly shades around, so I recommend to take the parasol (Sunshade umbrella) as the locals do.  I found the hat wasn't enough to keep the sun off.  The hotness in Malaysia/Singapore is totally different from Australian Summer.  Much more humid and make you tired more.  Our kids were 8yo and 10 yo, and they enjoyed a lot.  There were some quite serious rides, but I am not sure there are enough of them for bigger kids.",5.0
3584,Everything is awesome  ,"We loved it here. Something for the whole family. The displays were great, the rides and the staff. We also lived the waterpark and the Lego river. Big bonus of storm troopers and darth vader!! ",5.0
3585,But the Theme Park has some safety issues,"While my son had a great time at the park, I noticed certain safety concerns within the park. Staff around the Water Bucket Splash area in the WaterPark part of the park, who were supposed to be watching the kids and ensuring safety, were often engrossed in chatter and horse play among themselves. There was even one occasion when one of the 'lifeguards' were chasing another life guard around the water park and almost knocked a kid down.  I understand that the atmosphere has to be fun and friendly, but I think the main priority would be the safety of the guests, not the fun being had by the staff. Too often they are distracted by each other and not watching the kids. In the Slide Racer area, the Life Guard was busy chatting with some young girl guests while the kids were coming down the slides. ",3.0

3589,Lego land masti land,"Had been to lego land with my 2 lil ones,aged 8 years and 4 years for 2 days.we had booked a room in lego land itself,they were all lego themed n were excellent,kids loved the bunker bed.Near the lobby they had a big lego blocks pit for kids to play.For vegetarians they have  few food options,better to carry little ready to eat food.first day we went into the water park,all the rides were closely located and kids could play all rides and we had a lot of fun.The second day we went to the amusement park,which needs the whole day to enjoy,kids enjoyed lots of rides,my son did robotics workshop n he liked it.the mini land is also very well done.kids wanted to go for rides again and again,they were just not ready to go away from there n wish to visit again.the shops there had good stuff.",5.0
3590,Exceeded my expectations,"We bought the tickets to the Theme Park from the Legoland website 7 days before going there, so we availed of 20% discount. We were a group of five adults and one 3-yr old. We all had fun, although we weren't able to ride and visit all the attractions as the place was huge.  All 76 hectares, plus, we wanted to avoid the traffic jam on our return to Singapore so we left before 5pm. Children below 3y/o can enter for free, but I think in order for a child to really enjoy it, his height should ideally be 100 cm, which is the minimum to almost all the attractions. In case the child can't ride, fun time is still a guarantee as there are so many playgrounds to choose from. The food was typically priced for any theme park, and quite delicious. The staff has ways to entertain children while the adults are eating with matching giveaway balloons to make them enjoy to the max. It wasn't crowded when we went there last Sunday, making it all the more enjoyable as the queue to rides and attractions is almost non-existent. Waiting time was never longer than 5 mins. The only setback that we experienced was the commute going there as we didn't have our own transportation. There weren't too many buses going there so we had to take several buses and finally a taxi just to reach it. The ride back to Singapore was easier since we managed to catch the shuttle bus (Rm4.00) to Jurong East. This place is totally better than I thought and I definitely recommend others to go there too. Perhaps next time, we will try the Water park",4.0
3591,Excellent destination for the family!,My kids and I went for a one day trip to this beautiful destination. We spent over 5 hours there in water and dry activities. It was well worth it and it was a nice trip.You have to go there if you are visiting Johor.Make sure to purchase your tickets online one week before your trip to get the discount. I didn't know about the discount so I couldn't get it because I booked our tickets only 2 days before our trip.,5.0
3592,Nice room.,"The room concept is different from others. The parking is overly expensiv, unless you are the guest, If not is RM30/entry.",5.0
3593,Better than i expected,"I've heard friends talking about how hot it can get and lack of shelter, but turned out it wasn't so bad. The rides are kids friendly, good quality and not crowded at all when I was there over a weekend. It is not as pricey as a Disneyland, and just a short ride from Singapore. And the lego theme is charming. My kids played the dry and wet parks over 2 days since it was there first time there, and I don't think they would have mind staying for a third.Some of the rides are running at half capacity to save costs, which I understand since it wasn't crowded.Restaurant food is decent and reasonably priced.",4.0
3594,Not Bad,"Went with my 3 grandchildren ages 4,5,8,which is probably the right age for the park,not a lot to do if you have older children,nearly all rides are geared up for the under8's.We went from Singapore,which took about 1hour,including going through both Singapore and Malaysian Immigration,was lucky ours was the only bus there at the time.Plenty of food and drink available and prices were a nice surprise after Singapore,didn't do the water playground as the kids were to taken up with the theme park.Lovely displays of cities around the world,and the pleasant staff who work here are a credit to the Lego brand",3.0
3595,A great trip for families,"We visited this attraction and stayed in the onsite hotel. We had a brilliant stay from the second we arrived until we left. The hotel is amazing and the attention to detail incredible. The rooms are specifically designed for families and the lay out is terrific (Separate part of the room with bunk beds for three and its own TV).The park was very good, but needs a full day, arrive early to try and beat the queues. The water park is terrific fun and well worth a morning if you are there for more than a day, but again arrive early as by lunch time its pretty hectic. I definitely recommend this attraction and we will make another trip there as the kids had the BEST time.",5.0

3598,2 great days here,"We (adult, 12,11,11) had 2 days at Legoland.  We spent the first day in Legoland and the 2nd mostly in the water park.  There are previous reviews about the water park being shut during afternoon storms etc, we didn't experience this and it was open all day.  All of the rides here are fairly mild which my kids enjoyed (not real thrill seekers), but they were still enough to be exciting and certainly lots of fun.  We obviously times it right for out trip as I can't remember queueing for anything at anytime, it was fantastic.  Many of the same rides here as in Legoland Windsor, with some slight variations.  The food in the water park seemed better value to me.  We ate at the place near the wave pool.  We did try the pizza place in Legoland, which was just average I thought.  I recommend carrying water with you unless you want to be buying it non stop.  My kids had a great time here and would gladly go back again. ",4.0
3599,Great day out for young and old,"My 14 yr old son and I took the 1 hr bus trip from Singapore to Legoland. The trip is broken up by immigration and customs, interesting to see the difference between countries.Wide selection of rides available for all age groups. Lots of fantastic photo opportunities.The food and drink was relatively cheap compared to the usual amusement park prices.We visited late September and the Park was not overly busy. We didn't have to wait or line up for rides.One big down point for Legoland is the lack of shaded areas. It is extremely hot, and not having anywhere to escape the heat takes it's toll during the day.Overall it was an enjoyable day and glad we went!",4.0
3600,Kiddy Heaven!,Firstly be aware that this is a 4.5 hour drive out of KL and a day trip is probably not a smart idea! It is better to stay at the Legoland hotel for a night and take it all in. The park itself is not huge but perfect for young kids! My kids (5 & 7 years) navigated the whole thing in a day and absolutely loved it. You could do the water park as well which we opted not to since we only had 1 day here.,5.0
3601,Our bi-annual trip,"The place still lacks shades and cooling down areas, however, it has improved slightly since our last trip in April 2014. Service has improved tremendously but part of it might be due to the low season. The visitors were mostly tourists off children from international schools on their 1 week break. The games stalls wants us to win at least a prize and this makes the trip a little more pleasant for the kids.",5.0
3602,Lego Mini Land,"I especially enjoyed the Lego mini landscapes. There are Kuala Lumpur, Singapore, Angkor Wat, Taj Mahal, Hoi An,... and many more famous landmarks featured there, and they are all adorable in Lego scale. Other parts of the park are about average.",3.0
3603,Kids Loved it,"Our 3 young boys were kept very entertained here for a day. There are a good selection of rides for our kids (age 3,4,6). However we had some small issues as rides are often limited by height and age. Our oldest was tall enough for a few rides but not old enough, in reality the age limitation was not really fair for him.",4.0
3604,Good for kids 4 - 8,I thought that the place was good. The rides are super for our kids and they mostly all had some interactive element to it so it was really fun for them. The place was just big enough to cover in a full day too (although it ends early at 6pm). Only issue is that it's pretty hot so we made it a point to go a find a lunch spot that is air-conditioned!!! ,4.0
3605,It's all about timing /),"We had a great day out at Legoland with 3 adults, 2 kids aged 8 & 11 and 2 toddlers. All of us are interested in Lego and it was a lot of fun. The rides are more catered for 8 and up. We could only get on a few rides with the toddlers, but they still had a great time. I had read the reviews on here prior to going and was nervous about the heat and the queues. It was empty! We didn't have to line up for any rides and went on a few of them more than once. There was no queue at the ticket counter either. The waterpark was fantastic.. And had good area for younger kids too. I liked how the area for adults and older kids was separate so the younger kids could play freely without being trampled over. There were life guards all around which was good too. The staff were all friendly and the Lego shop was amazing...wish I'd bought more sets which I can't find back in KL. We only stayed one day, but we'd come for two next time. It is hot but there was adequate shelter and cool areas you could escape to.. Though I can imagine it would be a different experience when the place is crowded.. Avoid peak times and you'll have a better day. ",4.0
3606,Well worth a visit if near by,"We have been to legoland twice.  Both times very enjoyable. This is great place to take kids.  Lots of slides and small play areas are provided and stunning lego displays. If you live in Singapore it's a quick drive, just over the causeway.",4.0
3607,Good family fun with no crowds!,"We visited on a Tuesday and it was VERY quiet, with no queues for rides which was great. The theme park is small, but there are rides to suit all ages. Come prepared with a hat and sunscreen - it gets pretty hot, especially whilst looking at mini world (no shade).Food and drinks are reasonably priced, as are the lockers.We were hoping there would be more Lego characters etc to take photos with - perhaps it's too hot to be in a costume?We visited the theme park in morning and the water park in afternoon, Tip - book your tickets online at least 7 days in advance for a discount. Use lockers if you don't want to carry swim gear around while you are at theme park.",4.0
3608,Fun!,"My 2.5 and 6 yr old enjoyed the park very much. We went there early October on a weekday, expecting there would be many mainland Chinese tourists but to our surprise, the park was not crowded at all.  Each ride was 5 mins wait the most.  When you visited a theme park, I think no wait or a few minutes wait for each ride should be the best part of the visit.",4.0
3609,Enjoyable for all ages,We visited at the end of September on a Monday & Tuesday. Park was quiet with no queues for any of the rides. Good selection of food outlets to choose from. A lot of the rides are designed for children under 7 but enough rides for older kids too. The lego displays are fantastic. 4D movies were great too. Pricing of Lego sets no cheaper than Australia. 2 days is plenty for both the Theme and Water park.,4.0
3610,Disappointed in the staff and some interaction,"We bought $300 worth of minifugres for the kids to swap with staff, some staff were rude and refused to swap, others broke the minifigures or swapped the kids broken ones or non lego figurines. Very disappointing. On the up side the lego displays were good for those who appreciate the time and effort (and imagination) of those who built them, but starting to show age, we found the waterpark staff to be the most interactive and least rude, kids had the best time here. Lego was 2-3 times price of K Mart/Big W sales, save money and buy here, there was also no lego available that is not available here.",2.0
3611,Everything is awesome!,Went to the water park only as I was told the theme park could be too hot. The water park charged a reasonable fee and it was a great experience with no queue since I went there on weekday (right after a Malaysia public holiday). Took my 5 years old and 3 years old there and they absolutely loved it. It was a pity their height are less than 107cm and hence missed out a number of good rides. The services from the staff are good and very helpful. Will definitely bring the kids there again.,4.0
3612,I'm back! My Kids love it!,"This time experience better then last 2 year, more fun because of my 2 kids. Last 2 year i been here my 2 kids is still too small, but now total different. We entrance to the Theme Park on 9.30am. this time we start the rides on right hand side (LEGO¬Æ CITY). Start with the Driving School, Boating School, Rescue Academy etc. We never miss any rides. We have a lunch break in LEGO¬Æ KINGDOMS. We so surprise there are no long queue, we almost finished all the ride on 3pm. We went Water Park on 4pm. My kids love it. Tip: 1 day combo ticket just good.",4.0

3614,Great place for Lego lovers young & old!,"If you are a Lego lover especially with kids, this is a great place to visit & stay. The theme park has a convenient hotel with theme rooms & kids will have a ball of a time the minute they step into the hotel with plenty to do. There is the treasure box to open in the rooms, lego building contests to enter and not to mention visiting the LegoLand displays and a wetpark to cool down. There are rides for all ages in both the wet & dry parks. Parking is complimentary for the hotel guests and the buffet breakfast is scrumptious! The staff are very friendly and service is always with a smile.",4.0

3616,Great place for kids,"Kids had fun, Q for most of the rides are a short 5 - 10mins wait. We were lucky as the weather was good and we managed to have fun before it rains. Costs of food and drinks are high as expected in most theme parks.",4.0
3617,Good small theme park with an attached very nice water park,"If your kid(s) are into Lego toys, they will love this place (they will probably love the hotel even more than then parks). The park itself is just like any other amusement park except for the Lego Miniland (creations of different places in the world using lego blocks). The water park is very nice with some nice fun stuff to spend a few hours in. We found the food at the park to be reasonably priced compared to other amusement parks we have been to. Would recommend spending a few hours in the water park and a few hours in the theme park.",5.0
3618,A must see...,"Visited legoland during my stay at JB in september 2014. Bought a ticket for both theme park and water park. My children enjoyed both theme park and water park. Due to the time constraint, you have to decide hours to spent at theme park and water park. The more you spent time at theme park the less time you have to enjoy the theme park. This is because the theme park is huge and more time needed to walk around and enjoy the games. It will becomes worst during peak time because the ques is long. So be wise to choose what you want to see or enjoy.We are  lucky because  visited during a weekend not a school or public holiday so the crowd is small. Miniland was superb. The latest attraction lego star wars miniland was incredible. We were there on the second day of its launching and amazed with the design and the models.Overall, it is a place for children, for adults there are few to enjoy like roller coaster, and water park. Plan your visit during weekends to avoid dissapointment and check out their maintenance schedule as there will be some games will be closed for maintenance.",4.0
3619,"Great for kids, but super hot","We visited in October which is supposed to be one of the better months to visit. But it was hot, hot hot. And the park has no shade to speak of - no trees or shelters. Food options are very limited but that is expected in a theme park. The driving school is a great place for kids. And the driving license sure got the kid very excited albeit it cost a fortune to buy! The rides are all very kid friendly - barring one or two high-excitement ones, the rest are easy for even younger kids to go on. Mini-land as usual has some splendid master pieces of Asian landmarks made out of Lego. Just how do they do that!The Lego shops had a wide variety of take-home souvenirs but the Legos themselves are as expensive as anywhere else (outside the US). I don't get why they need to be but that is Lego's strategy clearly.We did not get a tan from 4 days of mad walking around SIngapore but one day in Legoland and we were all tanned! Be prepared for harsh weather, make sure you rent the stroller if traveling with kids - although the park itself is small, the sun will be harsh. But kids had super fun!",5.0
3620,theme park vs waterpark,"we recently went to both places on a very quiet sunday afternoon and deserted monday. the theme park is good for young children with limited rides for elder ones. I would say there are only 2/3 rides with medium thrills and the rest is for 9 year olds and below. the lego shops were very good with an abundance of t-shirts, hats key rings etc, so more than enough to buy gifts for friends and memorabilia for yourselves. the waterpark was pretty good though with a multitude of slides for young and old with some for group rides too. The lazy river was good, but easy to scrape yourself on the floor and the sides. There were lots of lifeguards which is always a winner. To sum it up my 12year old daughter preferred the water park to the theme park. They have more than enough room to add new rides.",4.0
3621,Great attraction for kids,"Legoland Malaysia's attraction are more geared towards the kids. Park has great collection of Lego, from Star Wars to Lego architecture of White House, etc. Food was okay, priced well for a food inside the park.

3622,Legoland!!,"We bought our theme park tickets and came in at slightly after 10am and played on till the closing hours at 7pm! Tickets are priced at RM120nett per adult but do ask for any credit card promos! The food here are quite pricey, which is a norm in all theme parks. Upon purchasing the tickets, you will be issued a stamp book whereby you have to obtain 6 or 18 stamps by completing certain games and challenges or rides. In exchange, you will get Lego souvenirs.There are a lot of nice items to take photos of and definitely you will spend a lot of times in the mini countries-land.Safety-wise, the rides and games are all quite safe and well maintained.Definitely worth your every cent! Be sure to buy some souvenirs at the end of the day!",5.0
3623,Kids loved it especially the water park,"Great place to take the kids. My oldest is 11 and had a great time (although I suspect by about 12 or 13 they wouldn't enjoy so much).We went to the water park when we first arrived and all of us had a great time on the slides. We were blessed to go there on an overcast weekday so there were no crowds and no waiting in queues for rides. We then went into the main park after lunch and there were a few more people by that time but again no big line ups. Kids enjoyed the rides and attractions immensely.Conclusion - great place to take the family, especially if you can go outside of peak times such as weekends and school holidays",5.0
3624,Everything is awesome! ,We had a fantastic time in Legoland! The rides were fun and managed to go on all of them twice. Had an enjoyable lunch in the Italian themed restaurant. Plenty of ways to spend your money in the various gift shops and we even got to meet Emmett and Wyld Style! Everything was awesome! ,5.0
3625,Awesome day trip!,"We went on a day trip from Singapore and had an awesome time with our four year old son. After reading through the reviews, we decided to go on a week day. This was the perfect decision because there were no queues!!! Our son loved every single ride and he made the minimum height requirement of 100cm for most rides. I recommend doing a day trip on a week day as the park isn't that big. ",5.0
3626,Legoland Malasia,"Spread out area   Really is only a place for very young,10 years plus would get bored very fast, ther rides do not hold the modern teen.   Food was good quality not expensive, park was very clean, the lego mini display was a FANTASTIC  work of art and will be the only part for adults to appreciate the skill of Lego art/build. Coming from Singapore to the park is a drawn out affair with customs /security going in to Malaysia and returning to Singapore. the ajoining waterpark looks better for the teens but is an EXTRA fee. If you have teens/young both parts of the park WILL be asked for to keep them intrested.",3.0
3627,Suitable for kids below 12 years old,"Games are suitable kids below 12 years old, not suitable for adult. It's tired if you bring kids below 8 years old cos there are some games might need parent's help.",3.0
3628,Sweat drenching family wanderlust!,"Went here on a weekend and was surprised that the crowd is not that huge. Food and drinks are not allowed inside but i managed to smuggle a few bottled waters and snacks inside each of our bags and my kids' backpacks bcoz they didn't checked. There are lockers outside for rent at RM10 to RM20 for 3 hours. There are nice cafes inside but i find them pricey so we eat at mall of medini, the mall before legoland where there is burger king and kfc. The place is entirely exposed especially the Miniland which is the centerpiece of legoland. You may wish to visit this first thing in the morning and arm yourselves with sunnies, hats and umbrellas, its really hot! For younger kids a pram or stroller is necessary but they always have available prams for rent. The place is small, you can finish the whole park in 3 hours or longer if you wish. from johor we ride the taxi (red teksi) for ithink RM20 or 30 we are four (2 adults 2 kids) if you're travelling solo you take the yellow bus from Larkin or JB Sentral for RM4.25. Bring candies and a lot of water, plus extra clothes bcoz some of the rides can get you wet. It was a happy place and the kids will love it. The rides are not extreme as the ones in Universal Studios, it is family friendly, and everyone can enjoy! The miniland is awesome with the asian countries made of 30 million legos..a must see! Each landmark is animated with push buttons that when triggered will make the cities come to life. Visit it in the afternoon maybe when the sun sets if you can't stand the extreme heat... wonderful place! Love to be back!

3629,That little child in us...,"I'm 47, my husband is 48 and we have 3 children aged 22, 19, and 14... when we said we're off to Legoland, some friends looked at us and said you don't have any young kids... and I told them, all of us have that little child in us that never left.. so we enjoyed our day there... we decided to go there on a weekday, not during school holiday.. so we can avoid the crowd... and we made the smart decision... we get to go on every ride...no queue... we get to ride more than once as we come down and go up again... we can ride on the kids' ride since there are no kids queuing for it...(normally only adults with young kids are allowed on the ride since the queue is long)... we get to leisurely stop at every corner to take photo... we laugh alot, we had fun... that was a good break from the daily routine life... and we purchase the ticket online more than 7 days before we arrive to enjoy the 20% discount... or if you have enough maybank point, do change your points with the ticket...that will be a great savings there...",4.0
3630,Awesome family days out.  Fun for everyone. Admire the amazing creativity.,"We LOVE Legoland!We had an awesome experience.  Travelling with family of 2 adults & 6 children aged between 5 & 15 PLUS grandparents.  Something for everyone.  You can easily do both the theme park and waterpark in 2 days.  Buy the 2 day pass, stay at Legoland Hotel for 4 days.This is a fun family park catering for children and adults of all ages.  There is lots to do, you just need to look for it and take in the atmosphere.  Appearances by WildStyle and Darth Vader were a favourite.  Tip: ask at the reception location, times and appearances of certain characters.Rides for young children, rides for older children, teens, adults and grandparents.  There truly is something for everyone.  Dry rides, wet rides, rollercoasters, and sheltered rides.  The 4D cinema was average.  There are 4 movies to be viewed and we were going to make sure we saw them all over the 2 days but decided one was enough.  If you want to get wet, sit in the middle, not at the back.Star Wars Miniland is a new attraction and pretty special with amazing technics and obviously many hours of work has gone into this display.  You don't have to be a Star Wars fan to appreciate this.Miniland, the amazing centrepiece of Miniland is incredible and has to be seen to be believed.  The hours and hours of planning, preparation and Lego building to make this an attraction within an attraction is incredible.  Asian landmarks have been carefully crafted out of Lego to make Miniland special for visitors to the park.  There is no doubt this park is being carefully maintained.Build & Test in the IMAGINATION area is a wonderful place for the family to keep cool and build Lego cars and race against other family members creations. My family spent at least 1 hour in this building.Lego Academy can be accessed at anytime and is a wonderful place to spend with the children creating.  The older kids, 7 years+ can go to Mindstorms and create Lego robots, bringing them to life.  Book Early for Mindstorms.Castle Stage, situated within Lego Kingdom, is definitely worth a stop, particularly on quiet days, as there are lots of Lego freebies to be won with participation and enthusiasm.Rescue Academy within Lego City was an absolute favourite from our family as we competed against each other to get the fire out.  Fun! fun! fun!, and energetic.Then, the waterpark, which I would advise to do after Legoland is relaxing and fun.  Go on the water slides, play in the water playground, hang out in the wave pool, and chill out on the Build-A-raft river where the concept of building rafts is fantastic but I don't think has quite worked as it is now impossible to build bricks on the floating rings, however not impossible to build a raft with the bricks.  The lifeguards are in good supply and life vests are available for the less confident swimmers.  The lifeguards are fun and will occasionally be seen jumping in the water to escape the heat or assist in building rafts.  A happy and relaxing place to be.Lockers on entry are advised as is lots of sunscreen.  Hot, humid and easy to burn.Do it!  Go to Legoland.  Check out their website for current promotions and take a visit in the Leho shop where you can purchase rare coloured bricks by weight, build your own mini figure and check out the latest Legoland style.  Apparently you can also bring mini figures to trade with some of the staff.  The staff was very happy and added to the atmosphere.  We even had an incident where we required assistance from First Aid who acted promptly and appropriately.Drink plenty of fluids.  Food is overpriced your locals, however, Aussies will find that the theme park food is quite affordable compared to Australian Standards.  We went in September 2014 which was outside Malaysian school hols and during Aussie school hols.  Perfect.  We highly, highly recommend Legoland Malaysia.",5.0
3631,Great day out,We did a Legoland and water park pass for the day and I found this good value for money. The park was very quiet and we did not que for any rides and went around several times on some. Our kids are 7 and 9 and they had a blast as did we as parents. I highly recommend you wear big hats or take umbrellas as it is very hot with not much shelter. The Star Wars exhibit was open when we were there and it was excellent with no waiting times. A great day out with cooling off at the water park at the end.If you are going to book through WTS at the Singapore Flyer counter I highly recommend you be there for 8am to get tickets and a spot on the bus otherwise you will miss out like we did.  The other option is catching a Malaysian taxi from Queen street who took us directly to the park and only charged us $70Singapore dollars.,4.0
3632,Great day had by all,"We only had 6 hours at Legoland so decided to give the water-park a miss and just do the theme park.We had a ball. Obviously quiet time of the year, so no lining up, no waiting..it was straight onto the rides and able to go back for seconds and thirds.We walked around easily.. Must admit had a few misgivings but it is well set out and easy. Very hot day, humid so lots of water stops... And some ice cream stops as they are relatively cheapAmple seats and sitting areas around the entire parkLego village absolutely brilliantThe Bricks shop strategically positioned so the kids just have to visit on the way in and then on the way out!We thoroughly enjoyed our time together as a family, found the staff wonderful and having not been to any other theme park we thoroughly enjoyed this park for what it was.",4.0
3633,LegoLand Fun!,Loved the Lego Exhibitions and all the rides! Worth the ride. the  2 parks with the lego themes are so much fun - for young and older....,5.0
3634,Falls short of expectations,Legoland is portrayed as one of the top theme parks in Asia but it did fall short on my expectations especially if you have been to other theme parks like universal. and Disney. The place is fun but most of the rides and stuffs are centric to kids. Since its a lego park so its more for kids. Wet rides are OK. Comparatively the dry rides are better. I spent two days there but I guess people with good pace and less interest in water rides can easily complete the entire theme park in a day. One thing that stand out is the lego theme hotel. They have nice concept rooms and priced descently.Must visit if you have small kids. They will enjoy it.,3.0
3635,Fun!,We had a great few days at Legoland with the little kids. Our 5 year old.son absolutely loved it! Perfect age for it all.Good time to visit as park was quiet and no long waiting times for rides and shows.We also stayed at hotel so was able to go.in and out as.much as we wanted.  Was lot's of fun,5.0
3636,It is what it is.,"Legoland is not Disneyland, and to be honest it doesn't come close. Disneyland caters for all ages but Legoland is aimed at the younger ages, unashamedly so. It does a good job for the up to ten year olds and fits the bill. The water park does ok but Sunway Lagoon in KL has it well covered. Again, it fits the bill for those younger years. A good day out but one day will suffice for both the theme park and the water option. ",4.0
3637,Great for kids but be prepared ...,"Like other reviewers, our family of 5 enjoyed Legoland and the adjoining waterpark. You really need 2 days to see everything and enjoy the water park.That being said, there are a few things to think about.We were staying in Singapore and decided to hire private transport to take us. The trip takes about 1.5 hours either way if there is no traffic (which means leaving Johor Bahru at 4pm to avoid peak hour in Singapore). Passport control was quick but you do need to re-fill immigration cards on return to Singapore.When you get to Legoland, there is a small area of shops just outside the gates. There are no money changers on site (and some shops only accept cash) but there is an ATM so you can withdraw in ringgits. We went on a weekday and it was not busy at all. There was virtually no queuing anywhere. Legoland itself was great but it was very hot. Dont forget hats and sunscreen. I watched my 4 year get red in the face walking from one attraction to the next. You really need to bring frozen water for the day to cool the kids down. Fortunately, many of the attractions were indoors with air conditioning, or were very relaxing (sitting on a train or boat etc).The waterpark was fantastic and we had perfect weather for it - hot but overcast. You can hire lockers and towels and they have very good changing facilities. A reminder that the waterslides don't allow you on if you are wearing a tshirt or goggles.",4.0
3638,Completely Disappointed,"Came in happy, came out frowning.Legoland Malaysia Themepark is a waste of money, inadequate shelter. Its was sweltering hot and not even half way through the day, it rained, unfortunately.it took 2 hours for the exciting rides to reopen due to bad weather, visitors were not well informed of rides reopening and the rain ate through more than half of the day and making my whole family disappointed.Staff are not motivated, and were rushing the closing time. It was 6:25 official closing of rides was 7pm, my kids wanted to go to driving school once but niggardly had the cheek to say its closed, there was no compensation for the long rain, very impolite and bored staff that need a good kick up their behind.Even as we were exiting, staff were just talking loudly and joking around at the exit, didn't assist with the door for stroller, no attempt to turn our frowns upside down, could have said a good farewell or some free gifts to give a better impression especially if day is cut short.This will be my first and last time Im visiting.Go and save some extra money, and go for Universal Studios in Singapore, which is more comfortable, easier to access, easy to keep cool, better amenities, fun for whole family, and lastly no stuck up staff like Legoland Malaysia.",1.0
3639,So much fun,"What a fantastic day we had here. It was a Wednesday during the school term and we basically shared the park with a few hundred people. No wait time for rides, they even let us stay on and go round a few times before embarking. So much to see and do. We spent 4 hours in the theme park before heading to the water park, however we could have spent the whole day at the theme park as we didn't see nor do all the attractions. The water park was also good, however our 4 yr old was just shy of the height restrictions so that was a big let down. Needless to say we all had a great time regardless. We ate from KFC just outside the gate a lot cheaper than the park food. Definitely better than universal in Singapore.",5.0
3640,Happy Lego fans!,"With 2 little Lego fans and 1 big 'expert' the family had a great day. Spent most of the day at theme park and hottest part of afternoon in water park, enjoyed both. Great and friendly staff made it fun too. ",5.0
3641,Too good,"Its was a saturday so too crowded. Since we went in the month of may..it was very sunny as well. But still we had so much fun.Our added advantage was that my 8 year old son was allowed in all the rides. This is the perfect age for the kids to enjoy an amusement park. We tried all the rides..each n every single ride, since my son wanted to do it. Initially the waiting time was high..but it gradually reduced. Infact by 5pm..there was no waiting time. We really had a blast.A must go i should say...",5.0
3642,Suitable for young children,"It pays to do a little search on current promotion as LLM always have ""Kids Go Free"" promotions with various events/partners. During M'sia school holidays last week, the current promotions were :1. Kids dressed in Star Wars character to enter free2. Exchange kids voucher with every 1.5L soft drink bottle (recycle programme by Coca-Cola)So we ended up buying 2 adults tickets while 2 kids enter free (saving of MYR220) by just bringing 2 empty bottles!1st thing to do, get the park map/guide and show time list and plan your route to max your visit. we were expecting huge crowd due to local school holidays but luckily it was weekdays and surprisingly no big crowd. No long queue and we even have some rides for continuously 3-4 times. We decided to move anti-clock wise because majority were going clock-wise.The rides distributed evenly for ages below 6 to 12 year olds, so there are plenty to do for each age group. Relatively smaller compared to Universal Studio, Disneyland and Movie World; the attractions are more towards young children and Lego fans. The new attraction is Star Wars but confined to built models with landscape of various scenes from all its movies (the aircond was a relief from the heat outside though).Wear light clothes, lots of sunscreen/block, umbrella/hats and water! No free drinking water/fountain here (unlike USS), all need to be purchased. LLM can improve by having more trees, canopies and shades due to the Malaysia weather - heat and rain all in the same day!My children had fun and we may come back again, but not so soon.",3.0
3643,Hot and Fun,"I must admit that children love this place very much. It is easy to get there from JB town (about 20 minutes).I brought my children (4 and 2 years old) there during the recent school holiday - 19 September 2014. Two parks tickets were purchased as to enjoy to the maximum. At the same time, we are worried that the parks will be crowded as it is the school holiday and long queues will be seen for all the attractions.I arrived at 9.50am. Tried to park my car at Zone 2 but it was closed. Heading to Zone 3 which is just next to the Medini Mall. There are plenty of parking space available. Parking rate for Zone 2 and Zone 3 are RM9/per entry. Medini Mall parking is charges hourly on rate. Buy your tickets in advance as to avoid to queue again before you are entering the park. Very surprise that there were very less visitors that day. Each attraction required about 5-10 minutes waiting time only. The weather there was very hot and all of us are sweating. Please prepare/bring umbrella, cap, mini fan, water and etc.Went in to the water park at 3.00pm. Due to the weather condition, the water park closed at 4.00pm which make us a bit disappointed. There were raining on and off which causing most of the attractions were closed. We have no choice and decided to leave the park at 5.30pm.You need to have some luck (weather condition) if you wish to maximize your enjoyment there.",4.0
3644,"Hot, physical interactive fun activities",Good clean fun at the theme park even though it was a bit warm. Wear suitable clothes & shoes as there will be a lot of walking.Bring your own food & drinks as it is quite expensive inside.Check weather forecast just in case there will be rain,4.0
3645,2nd time in 2014!!!,"This was our 2nd trip this year! And it was to celebrate our child‚Äôs birthday as well as to view the new Star Wars miniland. I know nothing abt SW but the kids loved it. We were at LLM for 3 whole days! We celebrated LLM‚Äôs 2nd birthday, which LLM had organised fireworks and with the 3D specs it was just amazing! At night, it was a little crowded and stuffy (as expected with our Msian weather) but it was not too bad once the crowd dispersed. During the day, we enjoyed all the rides from all different sections of LLM ‚Äì City is good for younger kids (aged 4-8) to drive the motorised cars. There are 2 sections, kids below 6 and kids above 6. The facilitators in the kids below 6 would need improvement in terms of their patience and communication skills with the children. The facilitators in the above 6 section were very kind and they seem to enjoy their work. There were some BIG kids (legs even too long for the car) but as they were below 13 years, they went for it anyway. There was also a boat ride.Adventure where they had Beetle Bounce, an indoor playland (hot and stuffy) and the Mummy ride. Mummy ride is air-condition so it was good to relax and cool down for a little while. Kids had laser guns to shoot for points too. Dino Island was not as great coz of the height restriction but we went for it once and got all wet. Good to cool down ÔÅä Imagination was fun, for the kids and adults. There are 4D shows to watch and its good experience for younger kids, getting wet, feeling the wind, trying to catch those 4D animals in front of them‚Ä¶ Kingdom is another fantastic section. Dragon rollercoasters and don‚Äôt mistaken the big dragon and the baby dragon. Teens would enjoy the big dragon but may be a little terrifying for those below 8, or 38 for that matter.  Royal Joust is a fave among little kids. The facilitators on the day we went were grumpy and moody. Surprising for those handling small kids. But anyway, it a hot outdoor ride that kids like.Overall, LLM is HOT, VERY HOT! Sunscreen is necessary though I got burnt either way as you sweat and it melts. Some extremely nice staff but some rather unhelpful staff you may encounter. Do not visit during school holidays (lots of tour groups / school kids) who push their way through, cutting Qs (just tell them off). LLM foresaw this and put signs that you are to Q and not allow people to reserve the Q for those who go for toilet breaks and all but some of these people don‚Äôt read I suppose. Just tell them else your 30 min wait may turn to a 1 hour wait. Good thing is these tour groups leave early so it‚Äôs much more peaceful in the evenings. Have fun!!!",5.0

3647,More can be done....,"Legoland is best suited for families with young children below 12. Teenagers may find the rides both at the water and dry parks mild. If you are looking for more exciting rides, I would suggesr Universal Studies, which is just across the causeway.It is extremely most of the time.  Feels almost like a desert. Most rides and attractions are not sheltered. You can imagine how hot it can be when you are riding or playing under the hot sun. There should be more trees, to provide natural shelter. To attract more adults to the theme park, the management should consider providing a roof shelter at the miniland.We were one of the first few who visited the place when it first opened. Noticed there are already some obvious wear and tear. It's more prominent this round.  Hopefully it won't get worse. ",4.0
3648,Extreme disappointment,The rides were not that attractive. The only thing worth visiting this place are the structural replicas. There are better attractions than visit this theme park.,3.0
3649,Picturesque park with minimal rides,"We went here 18/9/2014, and it was cloudy. The park is good, but the rides are minimum. The lego statues are the one that make this park a very good place for pictures. The rides are pretty boring and for kids. There is actually a place in Imagination, it is like a building place for towers and you can test it out by make an earthquake, we built it like so high and it didnt fell so that's definitely a good sign. all in all would come here again only when i visit JB. I think Universal are miles better just because of the rides but if you're bringing kids, go here.",4.0
3650,""" Fun place but beware of crooks posing as tourists ""","We were a group of 4 and we crossed the border taking the SJE bus from Bugis to Kota Islandar, Johore Bahru. Our plan was to buy entrance tickets but we realized the place was more appropriate for kids and not much for grown ups; moreover, the price was also unreasonably high so we declined. We had a frightening experience though when  3 tall and big Malaysian guys ( you wonder what these guys are doing in a children's park!)  started  following us the moment we stepped down the bus. It was relatively early and not many people were around.  We got suspicious they were constantly casting furtive looks at two of our lady friends who were taking pictures. And worse, two of these guys followed them to the female lavatory located on the left just outside of the park's main entrance but backed off the moment they realized a big group of tourists were coming to use the same lavatory.So, if you're going to visit Legoland, stay as close together if you are with a group; stay where the crowd is and refrain as much as possible from wandering  all by your lonesome. Be ware of the people around you and trust your instincts..the moment you realize someone is following go find a safer spot where other people can see you..better yet, if you're not travelling with kids, skip going to the place..it is located in a secluded part of Johore, Bahru and there are other nearer and more interesting place to visit.",4.0
3651,A Must Visit Attraction in Johor,"If you really want to explore and enjoy this Family Park together with your kids, I'm strongly recommend you to get 2 days combo which entitle you to access Theme Park and Water Park for 2 days. You cant explore and enjoy it within 1 day. Some tourists quit from getting the entrance ticket when they found the entrance fee is kind of higher than what they expected. But actually they LOSE. If you want an evaluation from me, I would simply said you pay less than what you need to for their creativity and innovative of lego bricks build-up. ",5.0
3652,Fun for kids!,"I'd say this place is good for family with kids. Otherwise adults, would prefer something more adventurous. Just about 15 mins drive from Tune Hotel at Danga Bay, we reached there early and i would reckon so to come early otherwise you had to park far. A lot of restaurants you could find before you reach the entrance so you could eat before you go. I like the miniature building models are very inspiring indeed. A few roller-coaster for kiddos and adults. The only thing is, I would reckon the management to consider more covered aisle and upgrade the classic slow moving fans outside the observation tower.",3.0
3653,Not bad but,Loved mini world and the water park was great after a blistering hot day. The staff at the water park were great fun and were great with the kids.Not a lot of attractions. Made worse when some weren't even open.We took a lot of complete mini figurines to swap with staff. Some staff were very happy to trade their figurines. Some staff totally refused while others either didn't want to or removed their hair or head gear. Some even discretely dismembered one of their arms before swapping. We took a lot of complete figurines in and came out witha lot of incomplete mini figures,3.0
3654,Fun place for the kids,"There are places you go with low expectation and they turn out alright. We decided to go to Legoland only because of the kids fascination with all things Lego. I had no idea what was in store but it turned out to be a charming little park.Though it has its own rides around, where Legoland differentiates is the activity areas it has. There is the Imagination, the different academies, all of which were super fun for the kids, the Miniland which was another interesting place and the Build and test areas were all activity areas, which combine expertly learning and fun together.Imagination with its program and build activity was the most fun for the kids (and the wife!). Its simple programming combined with a little robotics to ensure that it is fun and also a little learning on the basics of the programming.There was less crowd, being a weekday and so there was barely any queues at all and it suited us well. It ensured that we covered all the rides and could come out on time. Since the Legoland closes by 6-7PM (depending on the day) it becomes a little tight to ensure that all the places are covered.",4.0

And accesibility...you must understand this place is still under development...even getting there also want to complaint...if like this write to legoland mgnt nxt time and ask then to build the park in front of your house..,5.0
3656,Superb place for kids aged 3 - 12,We liked this theme park as it is very spacious which is important when there is a lot of people. Many kids facilities available. We liked most the playground which is situated at the mid way through the park. We disliked that there is very few shelters in the park. We had to cramp in one hut during a storm.,4.0
3657,Maybe fun for the first timers...,"Pricey for entrance & food...booked online costed RM400 for 2 adults & 2 children.  Had lunch at Pizza Mania that costed RM65 for 4 pax.  Some of the outdoor Lego displays needed maintenance..fallen pieces & colour faded/blacken due to the long sun exposures. The park is a bit smaller than I imagined with very few shades for shielding the tropical heats.  & it got very hot during the walk around.  Even in the Tower Ride, it was very hot in the cabin.",4.0

Entrance fee is pricey even for a single park for the whole day.Price as per September 2014Water Park : RM105 adults RM85 kids and elderly.Theme Park: RM140 adults RM 110 kids and elderlyBoth: RM 175 adults RM140 kids and elderly.2. Expensive food kiosk. Starting from RM15 - Rm30 +++ (even more)3. Both parks are okay but should have more attraction perhaps. If you have kids below 12 they would love both parks as it caters for kids below 12. Most of the rides and amusement even the water park and entertainment caters for kids.4. If you are bringing the elderly not much shade and pit stops for them to sit and relax, lack of shades of trees.5. Souvenir shops are kinda pricey, if you have kids be ready to spend a lot on souvenirs.Overall is a okay place for kids to spend time for holidays with parents but just be prepare to splurge on entrance fee, locker rent and probably food.",3.0
3659,Kids enjoyed but not good value for money,my kids aged 11 and 8 enjoyed the park in particular seeing the miniland and the other lego creations. Miniland needs some maintenance so all the little bits like the noises and boats etc all worked. Quite a number of the little things where not working. Rides where ok but if you have done the rides on the Gold Coast Australia these ones are a bit sedate and not overly exciting. We did a day trip form singapore on the tour which was well organised but the park itself let the tour company down on the value for money perspective. One of the best bits for my youngest was playing in the foyer of the hotel where they had plenty of lego to build.Star Wars section was very well done and the robotics lesson was the highlight for the eldest daughter and her father. More shade needed so take an umbrella or something as it was very hot with lots of concrete around. Very clean and food was very well priced for a theme park and the servings where good sizes. Don't think you can go there and buy cheap  Lego sets but everything was about 20 % dear than Australia. Can't say I'll be going back but it wasn't the worst day either. If your kids are intrigued by Lego they'll have a great day.Would have been good to see a lot of the Lego sets that you can buy done up and completed and on display. No Lego friends area which was a low spot for my eldest daughter.  ,3.0
3660,Hot,"Most of the rides are open with no protection from the sun, that can make a child tired fast and moody because of the heat, adults will have a free sauna, the management should improve on variety of food and quality of food served. Just spend 5 hours at the theme park, and it was enough for us.",3.0
3661,Not so great!,Went with lot of expectations but disappointed. The theme park was okay but not great. There are several restrictions for children under 90cm. Only those above that height could enjoy. No shelters around for resting and on a sunny day you will suffer! Personally felt water park was a waste of money!.,3.0
3662,First Timer !,"I only went for the theme park and not the water park. Honestly for the price i paid for just the theme park it was not worth it. There we definitely a lot of places to see, such as the mini lego countries and such. Not suitable for kids above 12 as most of their rides cater to younger children. Only went on one ride which was the roller coaster. Other than that it was pretty boring. Maybe their water park would have been better.",3.0

3664,Fun for kids under 12 years,"This place is fun for small kids, they get everything but for teen they think it's quite boring as all the attraction not so much thrilling.But for family fun with kids, I think this place is okay. Now they have hotel and  waterpark too which make this place one complex but at night it's still very quiet nothing around so you should go to the town for malls or window shopping.",4.0
3665,It was okay,"Place is bigger than expected and clean! More suitable for family with young children. Most rides are more suitable for young children. For those looking for more challenging rides, just expect 2-3 rides, which are also just average, but still better than the other kid rides! Enjoyed the Star Wars exhibition and also the outdoor park with lots of building Lego models, such as the Petronas Twin Towers, Great Wall of China, Taj Mahal and etc.",4.0
3666,Fun for Kids...,"Since we stayed at Legoland Hotel we got to go inside the park 30 minutes before the scheduled opening time.   The small kids aged 4 and 7 love the ""Driving School"" where they got to experience being taught about the rules of driving as well as traffic rules which they had a chance to use during the ""Driving Test"".  They got a cool Driver's License as well! Food was so-so though inside the park. Park is kinda small and you would be done going around in 2 to 3 hours.",4.0

However, I find that there are swimming complexes in Singapore that charges only sgd$1.50 per person and is equivalent or better. The only unique part is probably the Lego pieces floating around the lazy river. Saw some kids built a cool raft that managed to keep them afloat!",3.0
3670,A fun outing,Our 2nd times to legoland and still fun and full of joyous day. Kids love it so much and also the Lego shop...as a Malaysian we don't mind about the weather since we are use to it. Lucky the time we visit it is not raining. Overall legoland Malaysia is a nice theme park and the food is good. Price wise well it is the same price if we go to overseas park in fact we pay higher at overseas theme park than here. Delicious food and friendly staff.,5.0
3671,Great Fun being a child again,This place is plenty of fun but i found the pricing to be a little extreme for most things. Pictures costs a bomb at each ride so be prepared to fork out a lot of money. Water and food as well are quite over priced. Rides are not as interesting as Universal Studios Singapore but you go there to take awesome pictures with all the Legos. Don't bring too many valuables because you needa store it before you get on rides. It's a one off experience because I wouldnt go back a second time round really.,3.0
3672,Not much change," 2nd time came here, not much change. Nothing new (not yet). Swimming at the Legoland waterpark, not that fun as seen on commercial. The water dirty, there's some popcorn at pool. The wave pool not work, only fun at splash pool. ",4.0
3673,fun for kids,"Water park had a few rides suitable for adults, plus point-queue isn't that long, but have to lug the floats up to the slides to play. In Legoland, weather-very hot, can literally melt in legoland. only 3 roller coasters suitable for adults, the rests more for kids. Miniland-attractions like Singapore Flyer, Taj Mahal, suddenly a sight to see. But, weather was super hot, not many trees there. Food in the Legoland and waterpark were so limited. There's a few places to shop outside Legoland, but most of the shopping centre still being developed. 1/2 day for waterpark and 1/2 day for Legoland enough. Star wars exhibition more for photo taking. 4D show is water, more water and more water with strong gusts of wind. Prepare to get wet.",4.0
3674,Great - when you finally get there,"Do not go to Legoland at the weekend from singapore - unless you like spending hours queueing at the border and braving the chaos that is the bridge crossing at Tuas. Once you get there (two hours to do what is in effect 10 miles) it is great for kids, but seriously though, it is not worth it at the weekends. You've got the third world border set up on the way over and on the way back. Those parents with heart conditions should stay at home and take a weekday off work if they are serious about Legoland Malaysia.",3.0
3675,A great place for kids,"We had a really good time at Legoland with our 20 month old daughter.  We bought the two-day park and water-park package. There are a lot of rides suitable for toddlers her age, but I think it would be even better with kids slightly older. The staff were very friendly and helpful, and the food was surprisingly tasty. Our only complaint was that the main water area for young children was closed on the Saturday, which meant that there was very little to do in that area of the park. This seemed strange timing - surely it would have been better to do it during the week when there were less people? Besides that, it was a great day and we will be back!",4.0
3676,Nice park,"I was using waze, but end up at a dead end. Saw a couple cars that made the same turn as me. So, frat point that Legoland have to improve on is the signboard of direction to the place. The park size was just nice to walk and couple of activities to fill in 8 hours trip. U have to estimate another day for the water park though, unless u think your kids are zombies.... Overall is good, but my trip was a little bit spoilt by the heavy rain. No covered sheltered walking corridor connecting the activities, so if u are stuck at a place, u just have to sit down and wait it out. ",3.0
3677,Fun for kids,"We were members for a year and enjoyed every trip til the last 2 trips where we felt the staff were biased. We were not allowed to bring in a half drank bottle of soft drink after lunch, which were fine if it's the rules but the staff were rude. They shouted loudly at us when I tried to ask if they could make an exception as my whole family had entered except me. Subsequently we noted there were many Malay families with big bags of packed lunches and drinks. So we tried again at our last trip to bring in our unfinished drinks from breakfast and again we were stopped. Despite the fun my kids had, we are not stepping in there again.",4.0
3678,nice theme park except for the weather,"We were there on the start of Singapore's school holiday.  Were expecting long queues but luckily there wasn't.  We arrive slightly after 10am travelling via a coach by WTS.  check in to the attractions and started our walk around.  my children were both 11 & 12 thus there are some attractions which they felt they were to big for.  But nonetheless, they tried the driving school, boat ride, train ride and the some adventures.  and a plus the new open starwars attraction was available.  We had a long walk inside the exhibit.  Wow to lots of big huge aircrafts etc.... nice but I find the place quite empty with their triangular display... (like lots of space wasted!)We visited the 4D shows as well... but were disappointed.  the chairs were not moving plus there is a exhaust at the top of the screen that we are looking at.  Thus making the whole place unrealistic...The small world is nice to visit as well and it features Asia's place of interest!  Lastly have fun and be prepared with lots of sunscreen for the hot weather.",4.0

3681,Need Not Wait to Play,"Stay at Legoland Hotel, so got Combo Ticket for both theme park. It School Holiday, but surprise not many people, the ride per station can play again and again. This one thing good about this theme park, but hope not because of bad business? 1. Go in at 930am best, can try few station that already open, then 10am, when it fully open, can enjoy the rest of the park ride. 2. Those taking photographer, quite professional, they know what posture to ask you to stand. while it is common expensive to buy photo from theme park, but if you like us don't know how to do photoshop, may worth to purchase from them. 3. Weather turn hot after 1pm, so we go to Hello Kitty Town , shopping mall etc area and return again by 5pm. It proof worth it, as the last 2hrs before it close at 7pm, it get less people too, and we really got time to enjoy the whole theme park by ourself. some of the ride station, you even need not to q up at all, because there no one behind you. so you can play non stop. 4. They launch the Star War theme when we visit that day. It actually very small scale , but expected. nothing can compare to Sentosa Theme park, but the differ is - if you don't want to wait, you should visit this legoland, as you really got many opportunity to play all the ride (or maybe we just lucky to visit at the right time, haha)",4.0

3687,Lego Tragic,"I'm a Lego tragic so I loved this park. Its great for young kids, many rides which suit the 7-13 age bracket. Probably need two days if you want to do the water slides too. Waterpark is also best for 7-13 age bracket. Nothing overly thrilling for older teens or adults. I avoided staying in Malaysia opting to stay in Singapore. Haven't heard too many good reviews of places to stay on the Malaysia side so can recommend a Singapore stay. Park is only half an hour from Singapore however customs can add a great deal of time to that if you cross in peak hours. I went on the 3rd January which happened to be the first day of school in Malaysia, park was virtually empty. Timing is everything, don't know if I would have been so glowing had the park been at capacity. Food is absolute rubbish within the park but if you get desperate there are some rank food establishments just outside. BYO if you can or just rely on the delicious ice cream located throughout. Value for money is pretty decent when compared with other international theme parks in western countries. Would recommend it but as I said timing is everything.",4.0
3688,Interesting place to visit ,"Don't miss it if you love Lego. It is the only Legoland in Asia. We did enjoy here though we are not kids anymore. You would be highly recommend by me if you are a parent with kid under 12. All pieces are made by thousands or maybe more bricks which are really breathtaking. Miniland is the best part of Legoland, so remember to reserve more time at this zone. You won't regret! ",4.0
3689,Great theme and water park for families with children 3-13,"We had a fabulous day today at Legoland with our children aged 9, 7 and 4. Went on a Friday, out of school holidays and therefore did not have to wait longer than 2 minutes for any ride (in both theme and water parks). The theme park has rides that cater for all age groups. Our 4 year old who is very little, was not tall enough for many rides - which he found devastating! (Most 107cm+) But he had plenty of other rides. The water park is right next door but requires separate ticket is definitely the highlight. We were very lucky that we had no rain as the water park is closed during rains and no refund is offered. This is a great place for all age groups. We did theme park from 9.30am-11.30am, water park from 11.30am-4pm, back to theme park from 4pm-7pm. Huge, exhausting day but very worth it.",5.0
3690,Fun for even pre-schoolers,"We visited Legoland as two young families during the school holidays. The queue at the ticket counters were extremely long despite us arriving early. We expected the queue for the rides to be long as well but to our surprise, other than the driving school, the rides had either very short or no queue at all.The theme park is great for young children. About 80% of the rides are opened for kids taller than 90cm, which means most pre-schoolers can go on them (accompanied by an adult).We were not affected by the heat as it was raining intermittently. However, that means we had to scramble for shelter which did not help much under heavy rain. Our umbrellas were a blessing both during the sunny and rainy periods.Tips: plan your visit on a counter clockwise manner as most people would go the way round. This way you avoid the crowds.",5.0
3691,Not for adult,"Went with my partner and my mom. We thought it's like that of USS or Disneyland. Expected more but got disappointed. I think, children will more likely enjoy this place than adult. The  food is ok and price for commodities is fair enough. ",3.0
3692,For kids and kids at heart,"The 1st Legoland in Asia & it is right at my backyard. For a theme park lover this is park is a very tame theme park, most of the ride are for kids, great for parents. The Water Park is great but small & it can be very packed during peak season.

3703,A nice day out,"Having grown up with Lego, we were naturally very excited when Legoland first opened in Johor Bahru. Everyone who had been there before us said it's great but it's very hot. No shade from the trees. And yes, that is true. We were fortunate enough to go on a rather cloudy day. The air was still but at least we didn't have the sun constantly beating down on us  We drove there from Singapore. It was extremely convenient and it was very easy driving. Signs were clearly labelled and it was about 10 minutes from the Tuas checkpoint - without any traffic.People had told me that we could finish the theme park (not the water park) in an afternoon. I honestly don't see how that is possible. We didn't have to queue for many rides as it was a slow day, so the kids we ended up going for many rides and some rides repeatedly. Just before the entrance of the park is a small shopping area. There are a few places to have breakfast there, which was what we did. We entered the park before 11 and stayed till closing time. There is a ride where you can get wet - the guy told us 70% wet - and they have these drying stations to dry off - BUT you have to pay for them. Honestly, though, with the tropical weather, your clothes get dry very quickly.All the rides were working, and we had lovely staff - all could answer any questions when necessary. Those manning the stations might need to speak clearer sometimes(slower and further from the microphone?), but we weren't there for an English lesson! Some things to note:There are some 4D shows. Should you want to watch them, go and find out the times. We saw only 1 show though they had run 3 shows (not concurrently). So check the time for the show (or shows) that you want to see.Souvenirs/Gift shops - there is a big shop at the entrance. However, we saw two other shops inside the park. These shops had some items which were not in the shop at the entrance. You could ask the staff if those items were sold at the main shop - they would know; at least they did when we asked them. If you wanted to buy them as well but didn't want to lug them along, they had a drop off service and you could pick your item when you left.Toilets - clean and dry. :-) And they even had air-conditioning. ;-)Food - we ate at the restaurant which had pizza. We took a family meal which was a family sized pizza, 4 soups and 4 drinks. (for less than S$20). Personally I felt that soups weren't a good idea in the tropics! Something cold might have been better. However, for that price, I wasn't going to complain. The food wasn't fantastic BUT then again, which theme park has really good food? They all have the same stuff. At least the one we went to didn't only have fried food for kids. And to be honest, since most theme parks have expensive and awful food. You cannot complain about the food here. At least this wasn't expensive so we can't complain.There were also musicians who went around from table to table to sing. Get some money ready to pay them. We went on the Dragon ride (the one in the castle) again at the end and because it was the end of the day, the kids got to stay on it and went for at least another 6 rides (continuously). My friends who had been there before said they did that the last time as well. You can also choose to upgrade your ticket to an annual pass - the cost of the ticket paid would be deducted from the cost of the annual pass - at the end of the day. The office closes at 7 pm though but we were there at 7.30pm and managed to do that. With the annual pass, you also get free parking, so should you decide to do that, please take your parking ticket with you. You also get discounts at the shop, so you might want to think about converting the ticket before making any purchases (if any). The office is less than 50m from the shop at the entrance.        For children who are too short to go on the rides, there is Lego to play with at a lot of the rides, so the younger/shorter kids can play there whilst the older/taller ones can go on the rides. Definitely take lots of water, slap on the sunblock, and put your hats and sunglasses on. It might have been a bit tiring if it had been hotter, but it was all right for us.There is a Star Wars miniland opening in Sept 2014, so young Padawans might like that!",4.0

No Fuss, No Crowd, No Jam even though the crowd in there was Singapoeans and some Foreigners. The main thing is that the queue was SHORT! We took both the rides, dry and wet.

They still need to add more exciting stuff, but overall, since my kids are lego lovers, they really enjoyed the place. ",4.0
3709,A good way to fill in a day.,"Legoland was a bit of an unknown for us. We are an adult couple but have grand kids mad keen on Lego. As we were staying in Singapore we decided to do the day trip to Legoland. If you do it from Singapore, be sure to factor in time for the border crossings - two checks on the way there and two checks on the way back. They will soak up anything up to 2 hours of your time.Legoland itself - very interesting even as an adult. Pays to take the LegoLand express - a little train that travels around part of the park. Gets you oriented and you can see what you want to do next. We did a couple of rides - enjoyed the roller-coaster and the rotating viewing tower - great for photos. Didn't do Water park and I believe their claim it is the largest in the world is now well outdated. There is a new one in Western Sydney Australia that is now way larger.The star of Legoland is the  miniatures - and they are still quite big !! Loved the variety and accuracy. Taj Mahal was superb, but then every exhibit - some with with working models and most with sound you'd hear at that site...they were all brilliant. The largest Lego Cruise Liner is there also.I wanted to get a Lego Set that was unique to LegoLand Malaysia - but there was no such animal that we could find. If you do Universal Studios at Sentosa for example, thee are items that are unique to the Singapore Park - but not at Legoland. What was on sale we could get anywhere else, so that was disappointing. Prices were Ok - a  bit cheaper than Singapore shops for example, but the ATMs onsite were out of action all day. Food options were Ok - a couple of restaurants not badly priced and offering a good sized meal.As others have said - it is generally very HOT and sunny. Take sunblock cream and wear a hat or take a sunshade. Umbrellas can be bought onsite at gift shops also. The staff were generally very very nice and well distributed. No trouble getting a photo taken, directions or just information. I give this attraction a big thumbs up over-all.",4.0

We travelled from Singapore - booked thru WTS - 2 parks  (legoland and water park). WTS bookng/coach was great. On time etc... Only drawbacks - queues at Singapore boarder were long, doing both parks in one day was a stretch (advise taking earliest & latest coach). And we changed our money before getting there - which we had been advised to do. Overall, a long day, but great experience. ",4.0

For our kids ages, they had more fun at Legoland ... even then, there could be 2-3 more rides to make it more exciting.  The water park was done within 2 hours and although fun on a very hot JB day, it too could benefit from a few more rides.

Locker doors are computer controlled, so at the computer screen, select new rental, choose either finger print passcode or pin passcode and your colour, pay your bucks and you will be given the locker number. The computer then open the locker door for you. To lock the door, close and hold and you will hear locking sound. To open, head back to the computer screen, type your passcode and select re-open locker.For a price of 1 day admission that perceived as very expensive to average Malaysian, one way to accept it worthy is to see such money has been spent for good maintenance & consistent cleanliness. I have visited many water theme parks that offered cheap admission only to let you down over their facilities at sorry state & dirty environment.Unable to enjoy games meant for older children and adults as we are carrying a baby and bringing along a 3 years old child who need constant supervision, we spent most of time at Wave Pool & Joker Soaker.Most of the foods sold are nutritiously-challenged, so if you are health conscious, opt for fruit cup and nasi lemak (the burning hot spicy sambal is separately served, so you can leave it aside if you can't tolerate hot spice).  The nasi lemak served with a roasted chicken which taste good.You can avoid the sun and still enjoy water by soaking at Joker Soaker as the slides & tall structures above the pool are good shades.We appreciate if there are more trees with broad shade of leaves covering along canal of Build-A-Raft River, and canvas shade on Brick Blaster.We also appreciate a setup of a safe room filled with safe boxes similar to the one available in the cabana. Some people bring along their wallet, phones and cameras and they need a place to keep for a short while to enjoy certain activities that they cannot carry along or eye their belongings from a distance.",3.0
3716,I love lego,I'm a nine year old boy from England and i stayed here for 2 days the theme park was awesome and they had lots of good rides. The best ride for me was the project x ride in technic world. The miniland was really impressive and the sculpture of the taj mahal was my favourite.,5.0
3717,12 years old and below,"Read and heard reviews about how hot it can get in Legoland. We were lucky it rained in the morning and when we arrived at noon it was cool & gloomy.  There were occassional drizzle but not enough to drench us so we continued to have fun the whole day without feeling very hot at all.Rides are all still new and clean. This is the first theme park we been that hardly have to wait your turn.  Some rides they even let you have 2 sessions at a go like the mini dragon roller coaster, and bouncing tower.   We managed  to do all the rides within 6 hours including food break for an hour in between  and managed to catch 1 4D show althought there are 3 different shows for a day with lots of different timing. Just need to check on their show time as last show at 5.30pm.Our 3 young kids all below 8 years old enjoyed it. Rides as mentioned by another reviewer, exciting enough to get adrenaline running but not to the extend that make them sick or cry.  All rides are kids friendly so even my 6 year old can go on the higher level dragon roller coaster.But may be too kiddish for teenagers.   Recommend for families with kids below 12 yo. ",5.0
3718,Unforgettable two days,"Our two six-year-olds and we ourselves had a fantastic two days, spending the morning in the attraction park and the late afternoon in the water park. It was hot the first day, but there was plenty of shade to picnic and stop for drinks. We avoided the weekend and as a result, didn't have to wait in a line much (only twice - every other attraction we just sprinted to the start). Both days we arrived before it opened and left at six p.m. You can really get two whole days out of it. It was the absolute highlight of our Malaysia trip (Sorry Malaysia...) Be warned though, it's hard to get a cheap taxi after seven. We gave the kids fries at MacDonalds after the park closed, and there were only luxury taxis left, and since the park is in the middle of nowhere, you have no choice. The hamburger lunch place was ok.",5.0
3719,A day is not enough!!,"Had to attend my son's wedding in George Town Penang and as a sweetener for being flower girl at the wedding I promised my nine year old daughter a trip to Lego Land. Kids being kids not only did they want Lego Land but wanted to stay in the Themed Lego Land hotel.Did my usual review on your site and mostly it indicated a day would be enough........ No at least two is my opinion. A day at leisurely pace will cover the essentials but not do the place justice. So if you have the time do indulge, a full day at lego land and at least another at the water park. Considering the tropical heat it was a well earned cool down.LegolandWe were expecting ques at every attraction but for reason beyond me we were lucky and sailed right thru!!! The park is rightly so aimed at the under 12 and all the rides were sufficient to bring out the adrenaline but not so much as to make you sick after the ride. So parent do enjoy with the kid. It is a family affair!!! Great bonding opportunity with my 9 and 7 year old. If asked to rank the ride, it woulod be hard but the mighty mouse roller coast hit the right notes for every one. The motorised boat was very under powered and a bit bit disappointing. However right close by was the driving school!!! all my kids got their driving license fr legoland. It took my son three goes but he just wanted to drive the circuit more!!!!Food was plenty full but not cheap by Malaysian standard and has a lean towards chips, pizza, spaghetti etc. The good thing though the eateries were air conditioned and well worth the few dololars for a snack, drink ans a cool down!!! There is cheaper and better food just outside the front gates and as long as you get stamped on the way out return entry is no worry.Another worth while thing to do towards the end is to have the legoland photographer do a family shot. They do make an effort to capture some spritely photos. Well done...about Ringgit $50WaterparkA great way to finish off a day but could have spent a whole day here. It is hot around the theme park so it was easily pleasant to cool off and be dumped by their four story giant bucket of water, or water massaged by their high velocity pumps, or just sit and meander the ""river"". As I said time was a bit short so i did not get the chance on their gigantic water SLIDE but my kids told me it was more than fantastic.I would have thought with such high usage the water would be a bit murky but no it was crystal clear!!!! and cleanLegoland hotelI was quite taken aback by the prices asked for a themed room. But daddys must keep their promises. For the money paid I would say its not good value as the whole hotel is themed and you do not want the kids to spend all their time in the room with TV, play station. The seek and hunt in the room was a good intro but the hotel foyers were brilliant with lego pits everywhere. Kid and wife loved it.The restaurant in the evening was a giant buffet but there were many items  which they would cook to your spec. Food was bountiful, great variety, massed produced but had the homely touch. There as a whole lamb on a roast spit.  The meat was cooked to perfection. I ate it all. The menu had a lean towards lamb with at least a dozen or so lamb curries dishes etc. Lamb being so expensive in Australia I took full advantage of the offering. Now I know where all our sheep are going!!!! Cost Ringitt $60 per head....expensive by Malaysian standards but good value by Aussie standardsBreakfast was at the same venue and is included in the price. We were late having slept in but were never oncw felt rushed and they even make an effort that adult got their coffee and the kids their milk THANK YOU. The usual breakfast with noodle and curry bar, plenty of cereals, breads and pastries.Eggs in alll and every way but no bacon, Juice as per normal is a bit water downed.TIPget room facing theme parkrooms comfortably sleep 5 but no morerooms except for the theme is basic in facilitiesBathroom very basic but cleanno point paying for superior themed roomsget the kids away from tv and play stationuse the lego pits",5.0

3721,Far from resort standard,"We stayed for 3 nights with 2 kids (6 and 8). The room is spacious and neat. The pool is miserable and small that's why they need an upgrade while we were there. For a resort type of hotel, I would have expected more facilities and entertainment for family and kids and it was disappointed. We didn't eat in the hotel at all except breakfast. The price and the look wasn't very impressive. Luckily, there is a small mall right outside the park and they have more reasonable food there. But remember, everything close at 9pm. Water Park and Legoland is great for young kids and we enjoyed it very much. We did it leisurely, we spent 1 day in Legoland and 1 day in Water Park. I don't think we will go there again, once is enough.",3.0
3722,something missing,"there's something seriously missing from legoland‚Ä¶it just lacks 'something'‚Ä¶i can't put my finger on it yet. Our kids LOVeD it‚Ä¶but as a western parent I hope to never return. one of the reasons would be from waking on the first morning to violent diarrhoea and walking around the theme park later turned into wanting to projectile vomit with a hammering headache. Was it something in the cocktail the previous night? yes, my hubby and I enjoyed a cocktail on the skyview bar balcony which wasn't that enjoyable because chefs are only a few feet away bbq'ing meat and all you can smell is bbq'ing meat and you end up stinking of it and its very very smoky. Who designed this place? yes we took our kids there for a holiday and that was the priority but it would be nice to enjoy one cocktail on a nice balcony when you're staying at a hotel on a balmy night.The hotel is clean and the staff are friendly and they do a number of things for the kids which is great. But the shower rooms at the water park stunk of wee, and i guess with that many kids around this is unavoidable. If i had a choice to return to legoland or Atlantis Dubai i KNOW where i want to go. ATLANTIS> their water park is so much better and so much more fun. I think there were about 10 water tubes at Legoland water park and people trying to fight you for them when you haven't even finished! We couldn't even get breakfast on the morning we were checking out as the queue was horrendous! we ended up going back to our room and finishing packing and going down 15 mins before the restaurant shut so we could eat and then we didn't get to eat together as my hubby had to check out and stand in a queue. I don't know who designed or who runs the show but they need HELP. we had a do not disturb sign on the door and low and behold a staff member knocked on the door and started asking us our name and when we were checking out etc etc??? what the? every time we requested an item we got phone calls every 2 mins to ask if the item had been delivered yet‚Ä¶No‚Ä¶not yet‚Ä¶ this happened over and over. I never stayed anyway and been this harassed - yes at least they were 'trying'. As i said, this holiday was for our 'kids'. and they LOVED It. esp the giant lego pits. it was only 2 night stay and I was glad to leave. just don't go for any longer. I still have nausea and headache and my hubby still having diarrhoea 3 days later...",3.0
3723,Fun day,"We took many photos at Lego land. Kids had fun, rides are not that exciting but great with kids our fave is the dragon and waterslide,  and no wating l lines. Mini world is great. Recommend to stay the whole day to see it all. But they did close at 6pm.when we where there... weird but we had enough at that time.",4.0
3724,The Good The Bad & The Ugly,"It was a mixed experience. Really the management needs to hire someone who has managed theme parks and to make this an awesome experience. If you have been to a Disney amusement park this would be an ordinary experience. On a standalone basis great experience. Buy your tickets online there is a discount.The Good:No crowds and long waits for the rides. Could be because we went on a week day?!?!The Bad:Shuts down at 6pm. Which amusement park does that? With the weather in Malaysia you would think that people would enjoy their time during the cooler time of the day.The Coke restaurant does not stock Coke Lite/Coke Diet.The rides are pretty ordinary, nothing really exciting.Quality of spoken English is very poor. The Ugly:There is no water fountains around the park. You will have to buy water bottles when you are thirsty. When it rains the kiosks shut shop ‚Ä¶. When I asked, I was told ‚ÄúThat is the process‚Äù",4.0
3725,Family Fun,"Legoland is a place where you take your kids, take a lot of pictures, and watch the little ones run around and enjoy. There's a lot of things to discover inside. The Mini City portion is very cute and you get to take home a lot of pictures. The rides were especially made for family; no thrills and frills rides.Overall, it's a place where kids will enjoy, but teenagers might not enjoy it as much. :) A good place to visit and chill.

3726,A Top day out in Malaysia - Legoland,"The most enjoyable day's outing, enjoyed by all. We went with our daughter and 3 granddaughters aged 10, 6 and 1 leaving Singapore going through to Malaysia.The weather was dry, and we enjoyed Legoland, with a great time had by all. The ride queues and crowds were non existent with a low numbers about. Access to most rides and attractions was virtually hop on hop off.   This allowed us all to have  many rides and thrills. The Lego models, mini world of many regional sites was fantastic and the detail amazing. The staff here made for all of us an awesome day. The park was just so  clean and neat it was just a top day out.",5.0
3727,Everything is Awesome!!,"We loved Legoland!!We got into the park just after opening and left at closing, it was an awesome day.  We worked our way around starting with the kids getting their Legoland Driver's Licences at the driving schools and just kept moving around the park doing all the rides as we went (sometimes more than once). We also spent 2+ hours in the mini-world which was just mind-blowing.  There was a bit of rain on the day we were there but it was easy enough to find shelter and we could see that it was going to clear which it did.There were hardly any queues for the rides, it wasn't too hot on the day were were there and we just had the best time.I was apprehensive about what to expect due to the mixed reviews I'd read, but I honestly don't know what anyone could possibly complain about, it was just amazing.Our kids (aged 10, 8 & 5) loved all the rides, as did we. My husband went on the Dragon roller-coaster with the 2 older kids so many times we lost count, and again with all 3 kids on the Dragon's Apprentice roller-coaster.I would definately recommend a whole day at the theme-park, particularly if your kids are daredevils like mine and like all the roller-coasters etc.We had a 2 day pass so on the 2nd day we came back into the theme park to spend up at the souvenir shop (we ran out of time on day 1) and then onto the Water park for the day.Because we were on holidays we splurged on a Cabana for the day.  It was worth it as we had somewhere safe to keep our valuables, somewhere to come back to for lunch and a place for the kids to rest when they were over-doing things on the waterslides. There was also a cabana host who took our lunch orders for us and brought the food back when it was cooked. Our cabana was located at the wave pool, which was quite central to the park, close to the toilets etc, but there are many cabanas to pick from scattered around the water park.The water park was so much fun!  I don't like roller-coasters, but I do love waterslides and I went on them all!  Some were designed for the whole family and we could all sit in a raft together and go down. We went on that particular slide so many times :-)On both days we ate lunch within the parks and the food was ok. It was of a standard that you'd expect from a theme park and wasn't overly expensive, we didn't think anyway.The amenities in both parks were clean and there are plenty of staff keeping the parks looking pristine. In the water park the toilets have large dryers to keep the floors as dry as possible.Once again we were at the water park until closing time, why leave any earlier when we were having the time of our lives!!",5.0

3729,"Fantastic park, worth a visit",We were there a thursday in august. There were not so many people and no waiting more than 5 min during the day. The minitown was great.We bought a ticket for the Legoland and waterpark. If you want to see the entire park you need all day in the Legoland park.,5.0
3730,Good for little ones,Spent a fun day with the family.  It is a smaller park but when we went there were no lines and at one stage the kids rode one of the roller coasters 3 x in a row.  Better for the younger ones but my 11 year old still had fun.  It is very hot and cheaper to eat and drink outside the park.  We wouldn't mind going back again.,4.0
3731,A Full Day if you Add the Water Park,This is not a big park and the lines when we were their were nonexistent (which was great as we could just run back and ride again) so it only took us till early afternoon to go through the park - twice.  We went to the water park for the rest of the afternoon and the kids still talk about the build your raft - a lazy river with floating Lego blocks.The boys we had were 9 & 10 and they really enjoyed Lego land.  I think to get the most out of this I would recommend planning to see the park in the AM and switch to the water park for the afternoon.,4.0
3732,"Nice, Clean and New Theme Park","Very nice, clean and new theme park. Visited it about 3x with my wife and three kids. We came from KL so we drove 4 hours to reach Legoland. There's two separate theme parks in Legoland, one waterpark and the other regular theme park with rides and lego miniatures. If you are a regular guests with plans to visit 2-3 times in a year better get the annual pass as your 3rd to nth visit will already be free. The waterpark is clean with plenty of chairs and nice changing rooms. The waterpark is well maintained as they have regular schedule of sanitizion within the day. Twice I guess, one at morning and later at the afternoon.",4.0

3735,should have been in KL Area!,"My kids and I have been to Legoland in Germany and Orlando and decided to visit the new one in JB, Malaysia . I think this one is not that bad except it should have been built in a different area. I mean there was nothing else for us to do in JB and we had to stay there for 4 nights just to see Legoland!The park was big and you need more than one day to see everything specially if your children are young.",4.0
3736,World Class Theme Park Here In Malaysia,"I have been to my share of theme parks, international and local and I can say for certain that Legoland is right up there as a world class theme park. Location wise, it seems like it's in the middle of nowhere, so if you're not driving, please figure out how you are gonna get there cos it is quite a distance away from JB city center. A lot of people warned me of the heat and advised me to bring umbrellas. That was a good advice, except that we used it for a different reason, RAIN! I was there at the entrance at 10am opening time sharp, and was greeted by an absolute thunderstorm! It was a blessing in disguise of sorts, as after the rain stopped, we had great weather the rest of the time. None of the heat and sun that everybody warned me about.My family took the 2-park 1-day ticket and started off with the Water Park, seeing it was raining at the time. My 8 and 6-year olds had an absolute blast of a time there! Started off easy with the usual lazy float around a ""river"". A playground style area was also a good prep before going to the big slides. And there were some really big slides. All of them were well staffed and at no time did I feel any of them were dangerous. Just one big wet and wild fun. One minor downside is that some of the multi-person rides requires you to carry your own floats up the ladder. Not good when your kids keep asking to go again and again and again... We reluctantly left the Water Park at 3pm to go into the Main park. Not sure if it was because we had limited time but it never felt like the park was small. All the different zones were well spaced out and had their themed rides. There's always something for adults and kids alike. Unfortunately we had to give the Lego Mindstorms activity a miss, just to make sure we took all the rides. I had to say though that their 4D Experience ride pales in comparison to Shrek 4D at MovieWorld, Gold Coast and Disneyland's Honey I Shrunk the Audience. I was really impressed with Legoland and definitely plan to come back again, hopefully soon!",5.0
3737,"For adult, its okay.. For kids, its lovely!","I wont be saying much about the amusement park in this review, but more on the transportation side.So I today I tried cathcing public busses from Singapore to Legoland Malaysia. From Jurong East, i catch bus CW3/CW4 (Fare SGD 4) to the immigrations (Singapore then Malaysia), then with bus JPO2 (Fare MYR 4) to Legoland. And vice versa. Heres the thing, the bus which takes you to and from Legoland is only one bus route and serves 4 times a day. When I want to go back, I missed the 5pm bus, and had to wait for the 8pm.A taxi ask for MYR 40 just  to dropped me off to the Malaysian immigration office, it used no meter, so I dont know how much it should be exactly. I feel robbed. Other than public bus, the only way is to use travel bus costing SGD 20. What Im saying is, legolanf need to improve their ""reachable-ness"" :D",4.0
3738,One of the highlights of JB,"When we first moved to JB, there was hardly any tourist attraction for family and friends visiting us but thank God that we finally have a international franchised theme park which has served as a landmark in the town we now call home.We have been the annual pass holder of both the theme park and the water park for almost two years and it's the best thing we have ever done for ourselves and our toddler boy.  We could pop in in the evening and spend 1 hours at the park without queue to check out rides or have a stroll.The park is clean and new, a lot of things have been well-maintained so far.  If you are bringing a kid, it's strongly advise to bring along a stroller because the walk from the car park (if you are driving) to the park can be quite a stretch for a lot of adults and even more for kids.Even though our little munchkin can't take most of the rides due to the height limit, there are at least 5 things he could ride with us and for kids below 3yo is FOC.The only thing is that I wish there are more nursing room for mothers who need to nurse their young babies.  And please make sure that baby room has hot water supply.Tips:1. If you are a Johor residents and would like to get the annual pass for yourself and your family, look out for credit card or Johor resident promotion from time to time, they are totally worth it.2. To avoid the crowd, go on a Sunday as it's now the official working/school day of Johor which means the crowd would be much less.",4.0
3739,Well Built Lego Miniatures,"We went there on Friday and it was so quiet so we can play some of the kids favorite rides again and again. Generally the rides were just ok, but the buildings, landscape, airport made from the lego bricks are very attractive with some buttons to lift up cranes, move the boats, etc which make it more attractive for children. We went there by the WTS bus from Singapore flyer, and it took 1.5 hours to get to legoland.",4.0
3740,Excellent Staff!,"We came to dry park during Hara Raya festival. Amazed with LEGO models, friendly staffs, cleanliness and excellent food.One thing that caught my whole family eyes was the Boating Academy. We can't recall her name but she is an Indian gal whom taking care of the ride but she was wearing different uniform than other staffs. The way she handled the guests and there is always a smile on her face with efficient moving of the boats was excellent. We knew the job is not easy but she was doing it extremely well while smiling. We saw her again at the train station and again she amazes us by talking to us about the parks and hotel and even gave us some knowledge about the rides.We saw her almost at the entire park and trigger us to find out who was she actually.One of her staff at the coaster told us that she is the manager whom responsible for the rides.Never we seen a management staff work along with their staff and I respect her.I will definitely pay a visit to LEGOLAND for her and the team.,We Enjoyed!",5.0
3741,Great day out,"First of all basics: the park accepts Singapore $ but will give change in Malaysian Ringit. They do not sell sun cream (crazy, I know) so bring plenty - it's hot even on a rainy day. We went with kids aged 11, 4 and 2 yrs old. Many of the rides the youngest couldn't go on- but he had free entry and there was plenty for him to do regardless.. There were enough big rides for the oldest. The food was not great - we tried to get hotdogs for lunch and at 11.50am they had only 3 left and only served them with chilli sauce-Not ideal for little ones  (bring your own ketchup or take it over to the burger restaurant). They also had run out of sprite and Ribena which was surprising for the time of day. We later ordered hotdogs at the burger restaurant.. They came with lettuce and mustard and were more like a German sausage. Good for adults maybe....Overall there was a lot to do at the park, we didn't get to do everything. We will go back. ",4.0
3742,First trip to Legoland Malaysia,"The moment i step into Legoland until i leave the place, i can give 10/10 in term of their overall service provided to us as their guest. I went to other theme park at KL and never experience such an excellent staff such as Legoland. The staffs at Legoland gave us the warm welcome and of cause always there and ready to help with their sincere warm hospitality passion. I can say WELL DONE to Legoland because able to train such a quality staffs in your organization. Keep it up the good job. For those of you who travel to Legoland by taxi, make sure you pre-book your RED BUDGET METER TAXI. Do not take any blue executive taxi which Q up at the entrance of Legoland. This is because i did inquiry the price from Legoland to Johor Jaya and Blue Taxi charge RM 75 but Red Budget Meter Taxi only charge me RM 30.00. So be much more careful when select a taxi because no Red Taxi at the Legoland when you want to return. My advise is deal with the taxi driver to get your returning Taxi to avoid taking any Blue Taxi at Legoland. Overall, i can say Legoland did a EXCELLENT job and i never regret come to visit this place from KL. I definitely will come back again to this place. Keep it up the good job Legoland! Well Done!",5.0
3743,Lego paradise in the wrong location,"My whole family including myself enjoyed every minute we spent in Legoland. We were 3 generations of people who were fans of Legos in our childhood and we marvelled at the Fantastic Lego structures around us. Our first time. This should've been a 5. However, the trip to Johor Bahru from Singapore entailed going through 2 countries immigration, it is such a hassle. Public buses to/from Legoland from/to Malaysia immigration was completely crazy, no lines, it's survival of the fittest. And no practical traveller would plan a trip to Johor Bahru alone only to visit Legoland, as there is no other worthy touristy place there but that. It's either you plan a trip to Singapore or KL and do Legoland on the side. But again, the travel is just so crazy and may not be worthy for repeat visitors. I think this major inconvenience clearly showed in the little number of visitors i saw when I was there and it was a long Singapore/Malaysia holiday (hari raya).",3.0

3745,Terrible water park experience. not recommended.  cheats,Started with our trip to the theme park which was average. My 4 year old enjoyed the rides. We went yo all areas and to all the rides of which roller coaster wasvthe best.  The worst part was the duration of the rides which was hardly 2 mins at max. After that we went to the water park. We bought the tickets at 2:45 pm and the park was closed a minute later which we found out after we were told to get a locker for 20 ringgit. Since the machines didn't accept singapore $ so we were told to buy stuff from next shop so we ended up buying thongs worth 90 ringgit. We also got the change so we went n rented the locker.  After that we changed snd went towards the water rides where we were told its closed as there are thunderstorms.  I still cant figure out how the rides in theme parks were safe operating but water pool wasnt? Any how went back to the counter for refund wherewe weretold just to fill the feedback form and hope for thebest. Not going back ever again.  Also would like to tell everybody that if you are going from Singapore be prepared for the long queues at yhe immigration on both borders. Wasted 2 hours in the queues and it wasnt worthit at all.,1.0

3748,Family trip with young childrens,"We were there on April which is right after public school holiday in Malaysia. We book the rooms directly with the Themepark operator. The rooms in the Legoland resort was impressive. My children really enjoy. The treasure box game in the room was a good test for the children. There were not much queue in the park. The photos developed by the park with our family pictures much were overpriced. Weather were hot and the trees are not mature enough to provide shelter. For lunch and Dinner we walked to the food court outside the park ( about 80m) from the exit point, and there are variety of choice from western, chinese, Japanese and fast food.",4.0
3749,Legoland theme park & water park,"My friend and I visited on a weekday so it wasn't as crowded. We managed to finish both the parks within a day, got there at around 1030 and left at 1800. There wasn't much queue, the longest one was probably only 5-10minutes. The rides in both parks are great for family with kids. Lots of photo opportunities too, so families might take longer than a day to finish both the parks. There are more rides in the dry theme park so I would advise to spend more time over there. The water park is rather new and there aren't a lot of attractions. It's small as compared to the theme park. They have a lot of water slides which felt similar after a while hahaha. Lockers are for rent at RM20 per day, and they have shoe racks at the entrance of all the attractions. Lifejackets are available for kids & adults. For people who prefer wearing a shirt/top over their swimming costume, its not allowed on some of the slides though. Be prepared to climb lots of stairs!!The staff are friendly and polite! Overall both parks were enjoyable, only down side was the dirty toilets in the water theme park.",3.0
3750,kids should visit,like any amusement park but with lego theme.kids will love it.it is not very suitable for older children. not very challenging. but for under 12 i think is great,4.0
3751,Good for young children,"We went to Singapore and cross the border going to Malaysia. Crossing the border was a breeze - they did not ask for many things. I would say overall experience was good. Let's talk about miniland first. It's all good exceot for the Philippines. It did not highlight our beautiful landmarks like Mayon Volcano or Rice Terraces, quite disappointing. Maybe I'm too nitpicky because I know my country. Observation Tower is good because you get to have a good view of the area. You can take pictures from the top. Kids Power Tower was fun, my kids loved pulling down the rope and releasing it after. Try the Lego Academy too - they'll give your kids an instruction on how to build things from Lego blocks. It's also a good pass time to avoid the sun. My hubby and daughter ride the Project X and they liked it. It was too high for me so my son and I skipped it. Don't miss the Lego Mindstorm - my kids loved the challenge, they also got the first place, yay! It's about programming a small robot to perform some tasks. We ran out of time so we skipped the lego kingdoms and you probably run out of time too so better plan out on which rides/activities you want to do first. Land of Adventure and Lego City were OK.For those coming from Singapore, you can try WTS Travels and Tours. Just visit their website for the price. We use the same transportation going to Johor Premium Outlet. Also, beside the pick up point, they offer riding Lamborghini and Ferrari cars  but a liitle expensive but if you're a fan then this one is for you.",4.0
3752,"Family fun, friendly staffs....World Class!","We had been to some theme parks around the world, Legoland Malaysia is one of the world class parks. Try not to judge by the size and weather, this place has everything for everyone. From kiddy rides to grown up rides, indoor n outdoor activities and a waterpark. The weather is a killer but w lots of indoor activities, all is well. Or just head out to the waterpark. Lots of food outlets  n kiosks to quench yr thirst n hv a lil bite, the prices though aren't standardized. Good for family fun!",4.0

3754,Time of my life,"Our whole family (me, wife, 3 yr old and 7 yr old) had an absolute great time here. All the staff were very friendly and helpful. My wife lost here phone and our day passes, both were returned very quickly and with no issues. All the rides and attractions were of a high quality, only one attraction was closed but we understand that maintenance is required from time to time.",5.0
3755,Great for kids,"My little brother really enjoyed Legoland. There are lots of rides to go on. It was raining heavily when we went, so be sure to have umbrellas & raincoats ready in hand. So it wasn't really hot that day. You might want to booked the tickets 7 days in advance as you can get 20% off or take the package that is provided by the hotel.",5.0
3756,Legoland,very hot when no raining or cloudnot connecting shelter when come to rainday trip ticket expensive and not worth.better buy annual pass if going there >1 time within 12 mths,3.0
3757,Enjoyable day out,Good place to spend the day with the family with many rides for the young abd young at heart. We went when it had just opened..thus scenery was a bit bare but understandable. Not so good experience with the security staff though..a bit rogue when dealing with kids.,3.0
3758,Day out at Legoland,Great for kids between the ages of 4 and above as quite a few rides have a lower age limit of 4 and/or lower height limit of 1.1m.  Best to go outside of school holidays and during the week.  Went on a Monday and never had to wait more than 2 mins for a ride.,5.0
3759,"Good as it claimed, suitable for child below 12","It's a great place for children below 12. I would suggest to spend the whole day to cover the whole park. If you are interested in the water park too, spend two seperate days. ",5.0
3760,Legoland,My kids really enjoy the trip to Legoland..Transportation from the hotel is by the travel agent. 20 minutes from our hotel. It's better if you take package for the trip from the hotel partners. U can enter earlier than other people.,5.0
3761,"A great experience, a lot of fun!","Legoland was a great experience and was a lot of fun. The lego structures of buildings from around the world were amazing. A great experience and a lot of fun for the kids and adults as well! Just remember to take sun lotion, hats and water as it can get extremely hot!",4.0
3762,Unexpectedly Pleasant,"After hearing all about how hot it was and how long queues were, I was very hesitant about going to Legoland Malaysia. However, the little one had taken to a fascination with Duplo and Lego recently, and with a Lego-mad hubby, I decided to brave it. And I was glad I did! We visited on a weekday non-school holiday period. No queues to enter and for most rides. There was a long queue for the Boating School but we managed to time it well by going for early lunch then to the Boating School when most of crowd decided to go for lunch. The park was well maintained. I was pleasantly surprised that staff were also very polite and efficient, as I had a low expectation in this area, benchmarking it against the other places in the Malaysian service sector. Staff politely ensured queue jumpers went back to the right line when taking photos with the Lego movie characters. Very welcome, especially in this part of the world where queue jumping can be the norm. During photo sessions, staff were also very happy to help us taking photos with our own cameras, which was a nice gesture, compared to other attractions where they would not be happy to do so or even ban you from taking cameras, as they want to maximise the chances you would buy their overpriced photos.Food-wise, it is expensive to eat there as would be expected in any resort. If we were to stay longer, we would take the recommendation of other visitors and eat at Medina Place, just opposite Legoland.",4.0
3763,Great for kids aged 6-8,"A fun place for kids aged 6-8 since they may get on all rides in the park if they are at least 120cm tall. Only one ride is excluded from them even if they are only 110cm tall.Crowds not as crazy as universal studio... With the most time consuming ride being the driving school & the boating academy. However, the kids love them :(The rides close 5-10 mins before the park official closing time. Head to the miniland or to the shops after all rides are closed, still u've got plenty of time. The Water park is also very suitable for small kids... Slides are tame and the height requirement is lower than the other water parks. There are giant Legos floating along the lazy river called ""build your own raft"", u may collect them and build them on your tube ... It has made the attraction distinguished from other similar things elsewhere. The kids are crazy about it!!!!Rental for a cabana (full day) is only MYR280..It is equipped with a safe, loungers and a fridge.... Very affordable and a great choice for families.  Half day & 3 hour rental are also available. 20 for small lockers and 40?? for large ones, unlimited access. Opened by preset pin or fingerprint, very convenient!!!!Sun is fierce there though it is breezy there. Don't forget to apply sunblock to your hands even if u have worn a long sleeve sun blocker top. We have has our hands burnt after 4 consecutive rounds of lazy river.All in all, a fantastic place if you are traveling with kids who are 6-8 years old.",5.0
3764,Fun place to visit,"Having gone to Legoland in Southern California since it opened, we decided to take a day and visit the one in Malaysia. It was as fun as the one we are used to. The Miniland was fabulous. This one has the iconic buildings from the neighboring countries. The workmanship on it is incredible! It was good for my kids to see as well.The rides were fun. The food was good.",5.0
3765,WTS Travel - Bus from Singapore Flyer,"If you are on holiday in Singapore with young children, Lego Land Malaysia is highly recommended.  The easiest way appears to be to catch the WTS travel bus from the Singapore Flyer.  Total cost for Lego Land entrance plus return bus was SGD300 for 2 adults and 2 children.  At the office you are given the envelope with your Lego Land tickets, your WTS Travel stickers and the envelope which you need for the return bus ride.  I would recommend catching the 8.30am bus.  We had 2 stops on the way there of about 10 minutes each to depart Singapore and to enter Malaysia and got off the bus around 9.45am after driving through the Lego Land Hotel.  When going to the toilet outside the entrance gate, I knew I was in a different part of the world as the empty toilet was a hole in the ground with some sort of hose.  Inside Lego Land, there were both the Malaysian and the Western style of toilets.  Lego Land met expectations and the queues were reasonable.  Having to carry passports and bags ruled out doing the Water Park combo. Heading back on the bus, it took around 10 minutes to get through Malaysia departures and a wait of around 45 minutes to enter Singapore.  We were the last off the bus and it took us around 20 minutes to get through and spent almost 30 minutes waiting on the bus for the stragglers.  If you drove, there was a very long queue of cars on the bridge waiting to get into Singapore.",4.0
3766,good for kids,A nice places for children. Most games are suitable for children over 5 years old (with height restriction). The theme park is not too crowded compare with SG USS so don't need to queue for a long time.,4.0
3767,Fun day with fireworks on Hari Raya,"Had a great fun in the park including the waterpark.  The slides inside the waterpark was not high and dangerous.  In fact, it was suitable for me as initially I thought it was going to be scary.  I like the represented buildings of different countries built by the lego.  It was amazing.  Overall, a great fun trip.   I will visit again.  We went out of the park to KFC for our dinner which was walking distance and back to the park for the fireworks on the Hari Raya day.  The fireworks I think around 20 mins was great and awesome!!  We did not expect the fireworks that day.",5.0
3768,Lego fan and kids love the bricks,"We visited there on the 25 - 27 July with my 2 years old boy and my 65 years old mother. Our visit was just before the Hari Raya Puasa festival so I supposed we were able to avoid the crowd. I booked 2 nights for a suite at the Legoland hotel with combo tickets. The hotel was a bit pricey as it is a theme hotel, but my son loved it so much that I think money was well spent. The suite was still roomy for our group of 5. Remember to complete the in-room treasure hunting game and retrieve the prize in the chest. The hotel restaurants are a bit overpriced too but there is a Medini mall which is just at the doorstep of the hotel and theme park, where you can find cheaper local food and fastfood outlets. Remember to bring sunglasses, hats, umbrellas or whatsoever to provide covers from the equatorial sun rays and tropical rain as the theme park is mostly open area. We bought some souvenirs and Lego sets and the prices are reasonable. It is a fun place for kids and Lego fans and I think I will visit again.",4.0
3769,Good place,Nice place but i though it's will be better ..but my kids love it and we had a nice time .. bathrooms was clean but there still a bad smell in .. out side there is kfc and burger king resturent .. the hotel was very nice ,3.0
3770,Nothing to shout about and moody staff member,"The park set up were ok, nothing impressive as expected being an international names in comparison with local theme park around malaysia. So why pay more...? The Lego management should look into fixing the problem with staff friendliness towards the visitors. There has been many commented here, so I did not encounter a new and isolated case...staff attitude toward visitors as if we are disturbing their livelihood by queuing to get to the ride that we paid for. None are friendly or try to be one at least. By the way, don't bother replying since the reply seems standard. Good luck.",2.0
3771,Nice outing place,"Been there + Hello Kitty, 4 days n 3 nights...but 1 day earlier to look for good local food. look for best deals packaged with local hotels. Kids n adults loved it. Check out the weather forecast before deciding water park or theme park as water park will close should there be thunderstorm. We went it for water park as predicted it would rain around noon n we had lunch b4 going to theme park. Children would also love the driving school on Lego cars n rides. Personally, I loved the dragon coaster ride. A must GO at least once in a life time.",4.0
3772,Legoland Malaysia,If you are travelling from Singapore to Malaysia remember to get your visa firstIts an outdoor place to enjoy with a lot of sun and rain so be sure to carry your sunglasses and umbrella and wear easy shoes or sandles because its a huge place to walk and enjoyThe best part is the 3D movie theaterIt has cute movies playing each hourThe roller coaster and the danger dungeon are attractive ridesThe Passion Fruit smoothie is my personal fav You DO NOT get that flavor everywhere and its so fresh,4.0
3773,Day trip from Singapore,"We did a day trip from Singapore with WTS travel, it was vey easy although a very long day (we left Singapore at 8.15am and reached legoland at 10am).  My 6 & 8 year old absolutely loved the park, we went on a Friday and there were very little queues for any ride.  We bought a combo ticket for leogland and the water park and although we probably missed a little of legoland to go to the water park it was a good thing as my kids were struggling with the heat so it was a perfect break, and they loved the waterpark.",5.0
3774,for the kids (at heart),I love this place. Amazed by the LEGO structures in the miniland. Don't leave this place without trying the observatory so see the view ,5.0
3775,Let's go at Lego!!,"From Singapore, catch a bus infront of Kranji MRT going to Johor. There are other bus stations as well in Jurong East interchange and woodlands. Then arriving at the JB Central, catch a bus going to Legoland. You can also opt for a taxi and the price is ranging from 25-50 Malaysian Ringgit. Once in Legoland, Be mindful about the transportation going back to JB Central, taxi and buses are seldom. but most of the time buses wait for it to be full.",4.0
3776,Great fun,"Great fun for the family, the hotel was amazing inside as well if you can afford to stay there as we looked at the price for 1 night and it would've been $500 a night, so we suffered the 3.5hr drive to & from KL to keep a lil boy enjoy his favourite toy. The only thing I would suggest that they put more shaded areas in the bare areas as it was extremely hot",5.0
3777,A must visit!,Had a great time here. A must go for people of all ages. Water park caters for both adults and kids. Same goes to the theme park which has various rides both for the young and old. Food in the park is rather pricey and also the cabana's in the water park are over priced. Sufficient lockers in both parks to keep your belongings.,5.0
3778,Awesome time at Legoland,"We visited the Water Park on our first day and I have to say all of us, especially my 2 girls ( aged 6 and 12) had a blast including my husband and I. We spent the entire day there and it was hard getting the kids out. We loved the fact that as adults we could enjoy the rides and water play with the kids especially the huge slides in the centre and the beach pool at the end. There was ample food and drinks available though at a much higher price...üòûWe spent the next entire day at the Theme Park and enjoyed all rises and activities. The Mini Land was amazing. We visited during the recent Hari Raya holidays and was happy to find out that there were activities organised until 830 pm....dancers, magic show and for the finale the amazing show if fireworks!!",5.0
3779,Fun Half Day Tour.. Its Hot!,"My bf & I went last CNY. We reached there almost lunch time already and straight away went for a quick lunch. Food not so good but its okay.There's still some more construction on goingWe didn't try all the rides as mostly for kids. If you have kids and young children sure you'll enjoy more.What we enjoyed there was the basketball booth wherein you can get despicable me stuffed toy if you got a point. My bf tried 3x and managed to get. Wow! The whole trip good for a half a day only and we decided to go back around 4pm. Overall it was fun. Don't forget to bring sunglasses, cap or even umbrella as it's mostly open area you don't know the weather.",4.0
3780,"Average rides, great set up especially if you're a fan","The rides were average, but more made for kids. There were at least 4 rides good for grown ups. And as it seems more suitable for kids, try not to compare it with other theme parks, and you'll be able to enjoy yourselves. If you're a big fan of the movie, you'll like the set up of the place. Staff service was alright, contrary to what many say. Food was pricey (speaking as a local) but expected.We enjoyed the water park, but best to go when it's not crowded so you can skip the lines! Life guards were pretty strict about loose clothing, so dress appropriately (proper swimwear or at least more skin tight shirts and shorts without exposed zippers etc). It was hot after 12, but expected! So just come prepared, shouldn't be a problem.We finished both theme park and water park in a day as we went right when it opened at 10am so there wasn't much of waiting in lines yet. Book your tickets online to get them cheaper and be sure to check which rides are closed when (for maintenance). Overall quite enjoyable, recommended if you are a big fan/for kids but if you prefer thrilling rides, maybe you can skip this. If you want to go for the sake of trying, get the cheaper online tickets and go with an open mind, it'll be more worth the price and you'll still enjoy.",3.0
3781,I want more.,"A 1 day trip is ok to explore of the park. The miniatures made of lego are amazing that it really looked like the original ones. We enjoyed the rides, indeed for both kids and kids at heart. I guess what needs to be improved are shelters for some rainy days and a rest stop from the scorching heat of the sun. ",4.0
3782,great place to stay ....plus some tips,"we stayed at Legoland recently with our 3 'grown up' children  [ aged 22 , 20 and 16] , we had a great time , both at the resort and the water park and theme park .The staff at the waterpark were really good and endeavored to give us , and everybody a good time . We thought that ... ok... its not the biggest  , but , we had a good time  and shade .... there is really no more or no less than any other waterpark we have been too . The theme park was the same , we got our monies worth and dont go on the water ride unless you are ready to get very , very wet . The price of the food was the same as the shade ... no more or less than most similar places  [ but lots  cheaper than Universal Studios Singapore] . The resort ... the rooms are well set up , lots of lego to play with!!! The breakfast was certainly 'buffet' or should i say ...feeding time at the ZOO!!! ... but certainly lots of choices . ok a couple of tips ...go there with an open mind ... its for the kids at meal times ...just because they are buffets doesnt mean the plates have to be piled high with food and then not eaten !!!!!if you want to save money .... you dont have to eat at the main resort or the theme parks [you can get pass outs from them ]  as there is a mall/ food court [ Medini Mall] in front of the parks / resort and there are lots of restaurants [ from Burger king / kfc to Mexican down the other end which we recommend +++++]we tried a few and they were  good and they are all sooooo cheap  ...cant work out why no one else has said about them  ....???? send me a message if you want info",5.0
3783,Not busy on a week day,"I had heard this was busy, we went on a Thursday/Friday ACT school holidays and it was quiet with rarely a wait for any of the rides.  Had an excellent time.  Also, food was in the main tasty and cheap.",5.0
3784,Great Fun for Kids under 12,Aimed at the younger kids as it isn't a thrill seeking ride place - but does have a few good rollercoasters.  Wouldn't like to go there when queues are lengthy with the heat and the fact that most rides are fairly short.  But when we were there the most we had to wait was 5 minutes for any ride (big difference to Universal Studios in Singapore where you have to wait 40+ minutes for a lot of rides).  I found the food wasn't too overpriced like you find at the theme parks in Australia and there was a good variety.  The lego itself was more expensive to buy then what you would pay back home in Australia - but there were some things bargains to get still.  My kids liked LEGOLAND the best out of all the things we did in 2 weeks in Singapore.  Staff were all friendly there and felt totally safe there.,5.0
3785,Excellent Place to visit,We visited theme park.  It was an excellent tour for family and kids.  Enjoyed full day but couldn't finish all the rides and activities.  There is a lot to do there. One must have annual pass or 2 days visit. Facilities are excellent. Price is very reasonable.  I wish I could give it more than 5 star rating. ,5.0
3786,Wonderful family oriented park,"WE stayed for 3 days at the Legoland Hotel and spent all of our time at Legoland and the Lego water part.  It is hot, yes, as others have said, but it is Malaysia, the whole of Johor is hot and humid.  So we came prepared with hats, sunscreen and lots of water.  We went in the shade for break every hour or two and had a great time.  The rides are suitable for a range of ages, from 3 years of age to about 10 or 11years of age. My 8 year old son was in Lego heaven, he played, built, swam and went on rides the whole time.  A variety of food, mostly Asian, with some western options in the park.  Multiple Lego shops with discounts if you have an annual pass (which I suggest getting if you are wanting more than 2 days access). We found the staff wonderful, generous and patient.",5.0
3787,A great day out BUT pick the right day to visit,"I visited with my children, aged 7 and 9, and they both had a GREAT day. We visited on a Monday not on a school holiday so we had hardly any waiting times. It was also a cloudy day so we avoided the sun which would make this place very hot as there is limited shade. Lots to do and our kids were kept busy from 10am until 6pm!",5.0
3788,Very beautiful palce,"Suitable for kids under 12yo. Recommended. Kids are very excited. So many games. Long route, prepare your legs. Very hots in the noon 12-2pm. Bring your hat. So many restaurants inside and outside, you can go out and come back again. Don't throw your tickets. ",4.0
3789,Enjoyable,"We did a 2D1N to Legoland Malaysia from Singapore in June, staying over at the Legoland hotel.  Booked the tickets and hotel via the website.  Transport was coach from WTS Travel (recommended by Legoland website) which takes us from Singapore Flyer to Legoland and back.The first day we reached late morning, could not check in till 4pm.  We were prepared(having read reviews on tripadvisor), so we had a carry on bag with our swim gear ready for the Waterpark.  Left the luggage with the hotel concierge and headed for the Waterpark.  It is somewhat like WIld Wild Wet.At 4pm, we checked in and the room is great.  At the concierge's suggestion, we took a taxi out to a shopping mall nearby for dinner.   The next day was spent at the Legoland theme park.   It is very hot as there is not much trees and shaded area. So be prepared with caps and sunblock.  Had lunch in the park which is reasonable (curry chicken rice).  One highlight for us is the free Mindstorm robotics programming workshop.  The queues for the rides are not long, and staff there generally polite.The lego shop near the entrance had a deal which is pay a fixed sum (forgot how much) and fill up as many lego blocks you can in a bag.  That was a good deal too.Overall, and enjoyable trip.",4.0
3790,Such fun,"We went to Legoland not expecting a great deal, just looking for two days of fun over the school holiday period. Honestly, we were pleasantly surprised. We all embraced our inner kids and had such fun. The rides were many and varied, enough to entertain my two teenagers and my 7 year old for sure. The staff were so friendly and happy. The atmosphere was great, and the lego village was amazing. We did the theme park on day 1 and the water park on day 2. There were no crowds which made it possible to be at each park for five hours or so and go on every ride, some more than once, before retiring to our hotel for a swim and dinner. We would definitely go again. Such fun.",5.0
3791,Nothing much,"Our company's team building was held at Legoland. As ours was a group booking, we were allowed entry without any hassle. As our team building was spread out over several areas of the park, it was at that time that we knew just how large this park was. As this theme park is at least half an hour drive out of Johor Bahru city centre, the only option was to drive or take a cab, in our case, it was 3 buses. This park is not covered and it was bright & sunny on that day. So, bring alot of sunscreen. This can be a turn-off as there are not many restaurants to cool down at. And, if it rains, one would get all wet. The food & beverages in the park itself is expensive and there is a hotel and restaurant outside which is equally expensive. The only points of interest in this park would be the mini-landmark display made of Lego which showed landmarks from around the world and the Lego structures displayed around the park and the water park for the kids. I would not recommend this park as there really isn't much to do or see.",3.0
3792,"Parks and Rides are great, but services need to be improved.","Great theme, most of the rides are family-friendly.  Disappointed mainly by the services; not customer-oriented and very ill-considerate.THEME PARKThe rides and sightseeing is great, but many of them under hot sun. I do hope Lego would consider putting up sunshade for the rides. It would help on rainy days as well.We visited the park in July, at which the park announced that they are extending visit hours upto 9pm. However, we were very disappointed to find out that 80% of the rides were closed from 6pm. Worst, the staffs were unable to clearly informed us which rides were open upto 9pm. Some rides operators even proclaimed that the ride will only operate if there are sufficient demand/customers. This is ridiculous. We started our visit 10am. However, many of the rides were not open/ready and there were no explanation provided.  This is ridiculous, and not acceptable. It should be ready before the customers arrived. We went for the famous Driving School. To our surprise, many of the exciting mini-city driving routes were closed, leaving only a big circle lane. And again, there were no explanation to it.The drinks are very expensive (RM5 per bottle). Photo and any snapshot souvenir are also over-priced (minimal RM50). The park souvenir shop located inside the park closed very early, 545pm. Even if they announced extended hour, it was only upto 645pm only. They started chasing out the customers, near the closing hours.The mini-land displayed many interesting landmark and there are some interesting corners in every display. But many of the interaction feature buttons are not functional. Same observation for the water blast buttons surrounding banana boat ride.The 4D theatre has long queue. The waiting time were prolonged unnecessarily by the compulsory photo session at the entrance. It should be made optional and more appropriately at the exit, rather than the entrance.  Staffs are not customer-oriented. Below are several unpleasant occasions observed:(1). Staffs restricted one of the visitors for bringing smashed banana cereal (baby food). Very ill-considerate. They even conduct a thorough search on every customers‚Äô bag like immigration officer. This is humiliating for the customers.(2). There are customers who wish to get souvenirs, but their tickets expired the day before. They explained to the staffs that they couldn‚Äôt finish shopping due to the shop closed unexpectedly before 9pm. They accepted their explanation, but only allow one person under escort to enter the shop. This is very ill-considerate. I think they do not understand the customers‚Äô need. They wanted to let the kids choose a set of souvenir. I overheard the family complaining about the staffs impatience during the escort. Very poor hospitality. Escort is considered reasonable, but they should not be treated like thieves. I believe there are better ways of managing the situations.(3). Many of the staffs hide in corners, not attentive to customers and playing/chatting among themselves while on duty.  Some of them weren‚Äôt friendly in attending to kids.  WATERPARKThe water park is great. Compare to theme park, the staffs in waterpark appeared to be more helpful and friendly. They played with the kids, and helped the kids to aboard/alight floats. Life jackets are available and with many sizes. To our surprises, many of the floats reload are not automated. Majority of the slides required the visitors to carry the big heavy family float upto the near 3-storey height of towers. This is dangerous, especially for ladies and kids. The locker rental is per day, but a bit pricy (RM20). The access is good in security, because it only open thru matching finger print. However, it could turn-out to be a bit inconvenient, where we had to consistently rely and troubled the one person‚Äôs finger print to get the stuff. There are some shelf to put shoes/slippers in the waterpark, but would prefer shelf to put towels and bags.  The park closed 6pm. Many of the staff started to clean-up from 545pm, toys and floats were collected and locked away. Sharp 6pm, whistle blown. Many of the visitors at half climbing up the stairs were chased down. I would suggest the management to change their approach; instead of chasing out the customers, it will certainly be better if you allow them to take their last slide/ride.",2.0
3793,Enjoyable for the whole family,"We stayed at the new LEGOLAND Hotel and bought our pass for the themeparks through the hotel. We came in and out a few times over the 2 days so cool off a bit. The rides were a lot of fun and perfect for our kids under 10 years of age. It was fun to see my daughter drive the little Nissan car, we laughed watching her drive for the first time. The rides were varied and true to the lego theme. The water park was great. There were no queues due to Ramadan which was great so we went on the same rides several times. ",4.0
3794,Great day had by whole family,We loved Legoland and the water park. It was a hot day but very quiet compared to expectations. This may have been due to Ramadan. But it meant no queues for rides so we got to spent lots of time in both the water park and Legoland itself. The water park rides were not very hard- definitely for younger kids but that meant our kids got a lot of confidence. Same with the rides in Legoland- great for younger kids. The hardest roller coaster was just right for our not so brave kids. Very friendly staff.,4.0
3795,Brilliant Theme Park,"A great day for all ages.  It has many rides and amusements which are very interactive.  This park is easy to walk around, has many things to see where ever you look and has several rides that are different to other theme parks. A lot of the rides are more gentle than most theme parks, however, there are still a few of the fast roller coasters, very wet boat and ski rides, as well as, lot of unique lego pieces everywhere. Don't go to the theme park for cheap lego as it is not cheap. What is good is the prices of the food is very reasonable so you can take the family and have a picnic in the local restaurant. Take a hat as there isn't much shade as most of the trees have not grown as yet.",5.0
3796,Side trip,We decided to visit Legoland in Malaysia for it is near Singapore and for the sake of the kids who comes along with us and indeed  the kids had good times!  Since it was only a day trip we decided to have our breakfast in Legoland hotel wherein their kids meals are free.  The place was good one although the plants around was not well attended to but nevertheless for entertainment factor we all had a good times.,4.0

3799,Hot and Fun for Kids,"Went for both Lego water park and Legoland. My 6 years old son loves the water park more than legoland. Kids are having fun with the duplo at the lazy river and it's a place where the kids and adults could enjoy themselves. Meanwhile, the legoland is quite hot and the fun part that my son loves the most is the driving part where at the end you could purchase the license. Oh yah, the boat driving is fun too. It's best for kids under 12 years old. For adult, you would be surprised how they can build things by using lego. Amazing.",4.0
3800,"Low standard park, disinterested staff, substandard service","It's a very low budget park. When you are paying 150ringgit for a ticket, you will expect at least a quality fun park. But it was a big disappointment. It's hot, lousy rides, disinterested staff, and bad food. I am referring to the theme park. Came with three adult and three children, costed me some 750ringgit for entry plus transport from Singapore. Please do not come here and risk having a bad experience.",1.0
3801,Awesome and Cool,"We spent last Friday and Saturday at LegoLand with our 8yo and 10yo sons after getting a 2 day combo pass. We were happy that there were nearly no queues for any of the attractions (as compared to 40-70min lines at Universal Studios the week before). We alternated between LL and the water park to cool off. Highly recommended for families, however we could have probably done it all in one (full) day. As we had the combo pass, we spaced things out and did a few things multiple times. ",5.0
3802,Mediocre Theme Park,The park is pretty okay...but cleanliness could be improved. Staff not very enthusiastic like many other brand name them park. Some rides look worn out...even when its just a couple years old. Gift shop closes at 5:45pm...before the park closes...the operation hours also too short.,3.0
3803,Very disappointed,"I have loved lego my whole life but this amusement park was an utter disappointment for me. There were only 2-3 roller coaster type rides in the entire park, all of which were very short and not scary. The mini cites took up the majority of the space in the park, but these were not exciting, just mini models of cities made out of lego bricks. They had tried to add cars and boats that moved, but during my time there only 2 cars moved and one boat. The others had been broken or had got stuck. Would not recommend and would no return.",2.0
3804,One of the best theme park in Asia,"LEGOLAND at Johor is one of the best theme park I ever visited in Asia.    This is very well equipped playland with waterpark and hotel nearby.    Games, shops and restaurants are plenty to provide all aged visitors to enjoy at least 1-2 days holiday here.     We took the MPV car tour from Singapore city centre to LEGOLAND at Johor for 1 hour drive.  It is really closer than expected.    The location of park is also 25 mins to 30 mins drive from the city centre of Johor which is convenient to access too.       We will surely come to visit in later stage when new areas are under developing and expanding......",5.0
3805,Brings out the child in me,Fantastic place for lego lovers and kids of all ages. Very quiet when we were there but that meant no waiting for rides (mostly). Well maintained and loads of fun! ,5.0
3806,Kids and Lego lovers,If you grew up playing Legos ten you will be amazed by the wonderful Lego exhibits all over the parks. The rides were mostly for kids so teeneager/adults would have limited activity in the park. If you plan a whole day activity here with friends it will be better if you include the water park. We finished it in less than a day including the water park.additional tip: bring plenty of sun block and umbrella or hat or cap or anything that would protect you from the sun. ,3.0
3807,Get the annual pass if can!,We got the family annual pass... And it is well worth. With the premium pass you can go to the water park too. The pass allows you to go as many times as you like in one year. We have young kids 3 & 5 so having this was great because there was no way we could of done the whole park and water park in one day.So far we have gone 3 times in one month. We are staying near by however so there is no issue of time wasted traveling there like it is coming from Singapore.The kids love it especially the water park!Wonderful family day. ,4.0
3808,Wonderful family day out,"Took my elderly mum and 2 young kids to Legoland. It was a self arranged day trip from Singapore. It was tedious but there was no way around it as my mum lived in Woodlands which is close to the check point. Take bus 170 and get off at the Singapore and then the  Malaysian side of the checkpoint. Get yours passport stamped twice ie on either side. Hop back onto the 170 bus and proceed to Larkin bus station. Get on another bus to Legoland from there.Loved the park. It was hot as the trees are yet to mature and we forgot our hats, sunscreen etc. The park is designed for 4-12 yo so that was ideal for my kids. The food was great and cheap with a main meal, fruit and drink costing about AUD $8 for adults and AUD $5 for kids.We went on a quiet weekday in the month of Ramadan so it was great and the kids got onto multiple rides. If we have had to wait, I think I might have been frustrated.We had to leave our bags on the side for some of the rides. It meant I left my cash, passports etc. If I had known I would have worn a bumbag however 70s this may appear. There have been a number of thefts in Legoland!Overall loved it and kids were exhausted. 12 hour trip overall but well worth the trip. It cost overall AUD $200 including all meals and tickets for 2 adults and 2 kids from Singapore.",5.0

3811,BE CAREFULL WITH YOUR STUFF IN LEGOLAND!!,"Im from indonesia, go with my wife and 2 little children and my wife to legoland in 7 july 2014 we start in 12 in the noon, and starting the terrible and upset experience in legoland: 1. Must leave outside food event only bread ( this case is acceptable) 2. When me and my little children using one of the riding we had a nightmare, start when operator tell me to put my bag while we enjoy riding, but then i forget my bag, (+- 3pm), And when im remember that i forget my bag in 5.40pm my position is in the exit area, when i told to the office about my problem and try to going in again, the office told that cant go to the park anymore because its almost close, even i told that i lost my bag and my passport is in the bag, they just say sorry they cant let me in. They told just like nothing happen and they just told me to make a report and they told they already check in the lost and found there is nothing left, after that they told me to go to the police station in the anjung nusajaya to make a report. I go to police station and make a report, and from the police i heard that A LOT OF CASE in LEGOLAND about MISSING goods and no one can clear, because POLICE CANT GOING IN TO LEGOLAND, because LEGOLAND HAVE OWN SECURITY (HOW COME POLICE DONT HAVE POWER TO PUSH) And EVEN POLICE CANT HELP TO CLEAR THE CASE, My logic said that a MAFIA in the LEGOLAND STAFF, because the police said why i must put the bag? Because when u put your bag probably you forget to take it. LEGOLAND is international brand, that must have SOP in every part of the theme park, and i think standard SOP is every session of ride is finish, the OPERATOR MUST CHECK IN THE PLAY AREA about safety condition of the ride, there are any bag or something left in the rides, and so on, its DONE BUT WHY THEY ARENT take my bag and give to lost and found counter?????? Until now i still remember the operator who told me to put my bag, and I THINK ITS NEVER HAPPEN IN SINGAPORE SO PLEASE BE CAREFULLLLLL AND THINK TWICE WHEN YOU WANT TO GO TO LEGOLAND JOHOR BARU!!!!!!! I LOST 3 PASSPORT!!, IPAD, MONEY AND MY HOLLIDAY, i must go to make new temporary passport at INDONESIA embassy and a lot of things to do and missed my plan going back to SINGAPORE, because i must directly back to INDO So BE CAREFULLLLLL and THINK TWICE WHEN YOU WANT TO GO TO LEGOLAND",1.0

3815,exist of Legoland Malaysia...,"LEGOLAND Malaysia was built from clearing of rubber plantation. It is an entire outdoor theme park that comes from Holland concept. Apparently, this one and only one asia theme park has become a hit over just the span of 1 year in Malaysia, visitor from all over the world especially asia comes to visit this park that cater more than the mind of mere just kids. In fact, the temptation of this park is more than fun, it comprises of educating the young, the parents, the elderly, as well as building the bonds of the family and friends. Build on the piece of ""waste land"", it has transform the world place into a magical park that amaze one from far away land. No matter what religion you are from, what your skin colour, it just makes you just go there and have a good breakaway from the routine, mudane lifestyle that you have. Personally I am too old for this but beocs my kids love such park, it pulls me, my wife, my brother family and my parents together. This has built up a strong bond that we lost over years due to work and boring lifestyle. As I was always out alone with my friends, colleagues due to work, this whole day of outing with my family has also make me realise...I would highly recommend this place for family who really want to have fun thru out.",5.0
3816,Tiring but very fun family day,"We only got the chance to explore the theme park because my son got really tired after hours of walking and the weather (humid/hot) didn't really help at all. But the most important thing is he really enjoyed it, though he wasn't allowed on some rides because he's too young/short. He really enjoyed what was available and had a great day. We will come back again next year to explore the rest of the theme park, and also to try the Water Park. Also, I agree with some of the reviews regarding no shades/not much trees, they should really consider at least putting more sheds as the weather can go from scorching hot to raining! Also, don't forget to bring sunblock, hats and a lot of water.",4.0
3817,Fun place for kids and adults,"Many fun rides with different themes. Kids would love the driving school at Lego City. F&B prices are a touch high, but quality food. ",5.0
3818,Fun but worth the effort?,"We were staying in Singapore for a holiday and our kids (aged 5 and 7) were really keen to go to Legoland. I booked online through a travel company called WTS without too much trouble. A combo pass for Legoland and the Lego water park next door, plus the bus fare for four people cost about $266 AU.The bus left from the Singapore Flyer at 9am. Make sure you get there early as it's a bit chaotic, but we found ourselves on the right bus without too much trouble.The bus trip was fine, though having to get off twice for immigration was a bit tiresome. The lines at the Singapore  immigration hall were long and took about 20 mins or so (Malaysia was quicker). The trip took about 1 1/2 hours there.Legoland itself is fun, especially for younger kids. But having been to Universal Studios the day before though, it was a bit disappointing. It was vey hot (no shade - it will no doubt improve as the trees grow taller!) make sure you have hats, cream etc.  There were virtually no queues (we went on a Friday) and one of the pluses of the day was that it didn't feel crowded at all. You could easily jump back on for a second ride if you wanted. Food options were a little odd in some places eg I wanted bit chips, but to get it I needed to buy a quarter of a chicken, with soup and ""soda"". I later found a better food place, which was pretty cheap.I'm really glad we booked for the water park too. A tip might be to wear your swimmers etc around Legoland and simply change into dry clothes at the end of the day. Take thongs (flip flops). The water park was fun and well supervised. I'm pretty sure you can easily buy tickets there if you don't pre-book.Use bus trip back took longer as we hit Singapore traffic. We got back about 7pm and the queue for taxis at the Flyer was enormous, so we had two very tired, hungry kids on our hands. But that can't be helped. They had lots of fun.Is it worth the time and money? Depends how much your kids like Lego I guess. I didn't absolutely love it, and the kids did prefer USS. but it was a fun family day out that they'll remember.",3.0
3819,Fun filled day,"Did a one day tour from Singapore. I used busonline ticket.com to make booking. I was picked up from Lavender station. My son (age 9) and I did the combo package that included the water park and Lego land park.  Legoland is a great park but it designed for young kids 4-12. The water park  part is for any age. I could not get my son out of the water. I recommend the combo package to fill in the whole day.There is a change room and lockers located at the water park area. Lockers Also located at entrance to park.I recommend the 4D show. We went in July on a weekday and we did not encounter and lines for rides, however I imagine this theme park would get very busy on weekends. Lots of lego souvenirs to choose from in the shops. A lego kids tshirt set me back about $16 Aust which I thought was a good price.You need your passport as you leave singapore and you will go through two customs. Don't forget to take the white customs slip in your passport. The bus waits for you to go through.Check the online lego land web site first to check no maintenance is going on the day you want to go. I changed $50singapore  to Malaysia currency just for snacks in park. It was very hot when we went so keep up the fluids. The parks food was very poor to average so if you can hold out eat in the mall which is located just outside park entrance.This park was lots of fun and my 9 year old loved it.",5.0

3821,Good family day at a theme park. Extremely hot.,"Day: Weekday (Thurs in June)Tickets: Brought from WTS from Singapore a week + before the trip. Including to and fro (day). There are several time slots to choose for to and return trips.Journey To: Took about 1.5 hours including customs to reach. Coach had went to drop off passengers at Hello Kitty first.Park: Interesting Lego theme park, IMO mainly suited for kids like say primary school levels.The driving school (for kids only and longer q wait), boating school, Dragon Apprentice, etc were decent rides. Skip the dino island, if one prefer not to be wet,Crowd was ""medium"",  so it took us before <4-5 hours to finish the park +lunch. Was able to do a few repeated rides one hour before park closed without much queue.Merchandise /Food: Typical theme park merchandise for sale. e.g. Keychain cheapest is about RM10 to give a gauge, Food ok but not fantastic. eg.:RM15-20 for a burger if I remembered correctly.Return Journey: Easily found the travel agents at exits.Coach came on time Back to Singapore in around 1.5 hours including customs (Tuas 2nd link).Overall: Good family day at a theme park.

3822,"Legoland, JB water park and theme park.","Together with family and friends, we went to the JB Legoland water park on 23/06/14. We had fun there. But the weather is super hot. Do remember to apply lots of sun block and drink plenty of water. The floor is very hot, so it's better to have your footwear with you when you move around. The change room is huge with many lockers for rental. On 24/06/14, we went the theme park. It was another super hot day. Better to wear a hat, cap or carry umbrella with you. There's not much sheltered area where you can escape the burning heat. The rides are ok but because of the hot hot sun, the children get tired easily. Then prefer the air conditioned places like shop, or indoor stuff. The kids love the make your own Lego figurines, 3 for Rm25. Children assemble and fix their own figurines according to their own imagination. Please remember to protect yourself and your love ones against the mosquito.

3823,Fun day out with the family,"We visited Legoland Theme park and water park on a Tuesday as part of a large family group. The theme park is targeted at children. I say this because the rides were fun but they weren't super thrilling for adults. We loved the atmosphere of the theme park, it was so colourful, clean and there was a happy vibe. If you love Lego, you will love the theme park. There are Lego-themed decorations everywhere and even the tandas (restrooms) are similarly themed. Lucky for us, the theme park wasn't overly crowded so the queue time for rides was pretty reasonable all day. The water park is better for all ages with some good water slides and a river. The water park was very crowded by the time we made our way over there (after 3pm) and it was good to be able to cool off after walking around the park in the heat.    All in all we enjoyed our day at Legoland and would definitely visit again!",5.0

3828,"Annual pass, for family with young children","We bought the annual pass for the theme park only.  The first two visits, we were still trying new things and the kids are still very excited (5, 7 and 9).  However, visits after that was only fun when they have friends or cousins with them or if there were major events (minifigure x-change, star wars etc).  The workshops and movies (except one) remained the same since the park opens.  There are mild insignificant changes here and there but did not add too much value to the visit.  Number of visitors have dropped since the Legoland water park opened making it easier to get on rides.  However, sometimes they appear short-handed.  Although there are not too many people at the driving school, we waited over 30 min perhaps because the same person gave the briefing before the ride and also was in charge outside (it seems so at least, because he disappears in the room and later come back out with a new batch of kids).  For first time visitors with kids, the park is excellent for young children but for annual pass holders, it is probably value for money for 1 year but not more unless the management organise more events especially during holidays and festive seasons.  Simply closing later during Ramadan is not attractive enough.  They need to grow more shady trees.  The lack of plants make the place extremely unbearable on a hot day.  If you are not used to the hot weather, bring some shade and huge supply of water to prevent dehydration.",4.0

The highlight of the water park was the build a raft ride, which my 6 year old son absolutely loved. The theme park is great for kids of all ages, with rides, shows, and probably the highlight being miniland. Here you can see some awesome Lego constructions.

3834,Being Kids Again...,"I remembered myself as a child, my parents used to buy me Lego sets to play. They were to be my toys during playtime as the only limits to playing Lego is the imagination. I would built anything that comes to mind based on my imagination. So, when Malaysia decided to build a Legoland in Johore, it was much awaited event for me as it was a trip back to my childhood. And I wanted my two children to experience the joy I had when playing with Lego. We bought the 2-Day-2-Parks Combo tickets during my last trip there. We did not want to rush through things. This way, we can slowly enjoy the parks.On our first day, we went to the Water Theme Park. The rides are just right for my kids who are 11 and 5. They both just love the different water slides there as they were not too dangerous or neither are they too fast for their likings. The way the park is constructed, I can safely let my kids roam around on their own and enjoying themselves with the rides as I know they will always be under the watchful eyes of the lifeguards on duty. A four hour time spent in the water park allowed us enough time to experience every rides at our own time. The second day we were there, we went to the main theme park. It was an eye opening experience not only for me, but for my children too. It was like we were in Lego Heaven. My children were so excited to see statues and characters madeof Lego bricks. Again, here, the rides are quite docile, pretty much suitable for children to enjoy themselves without having the scare of their lives. The rides we enjoyed most are the Technics and the Dragon roller coaster. We even went for them at least twice each. We spent six hours here and every minute was well spent and enjoyable. My family had a lot of fun in Legoland and we are planning to buy the annual pass already being so near to us.  All in all, it is a fun family themed park where children can enjoy themselves and the adults can go back to being children again. Oh, and the cleanliness of the park is very well kept and maintained.We had so much fun here and we will be coming back in between our short trips here in Johor.",4.0

But we grown up adults had fun anyway with rides like Boating School, Fire engine, Aquazone, Observation Tower etc.  The queue was acceptable with maximum waiting time of 15 mins for a couple of rides/movie.  However, we didn't take the roller coaster nor the likes of it.  Weather was good on that day, cloudy, and most of the chosen rides had shades and fan, so we didn't feel much of the heat.  Miniland should be a hit for many people.  Staff were friendly and patient. Food was reasonably priced for theme park but not that tasty.  We ordered kids set pizza as we wanted variety.  We rented a medium size locker which can put in two bags that costs RM20 for 1 day. The largest size locker which is the bigger of the two available sizes costs RM40 per day.  Regarding souvenirs, it is not that cheap because they are Lego.  One key chain for example a superhero type costs RM19.95.  Bathrooms are clean.

3840,a far cry from Disney,"perhaps the comparison is unfair.. but I reckon Disney is the standard to strive for since Legoland prices are within the same range..from the start, Reception was slow even though I was one of ONLY TWO people waiting to check-in (I would later discover this to be a consistent trait as I visited the counter 2 more times before a final lengthy check-out)Crew tried to engage the kids but we could tell it was more of a chore for them then borne out of genuine interestWe stayed 2 nights at the Adventure rooms with breakfast and combo tickets added onWe should have opted not to have the breakfast add-on as the food was poorIf you tend to wake up late (read: past 9am); then suggest you avoid their breakfast and head to Medini Mall next door.The queues to get into the hotel breakfast is chaotic past 9am as the staff are ill-prepared to handle the large crowd (queue numbers are issued)I dun think you can do any worse at Medini although oddly the eating establishments only open from 10am or sothe episode that truly left a bad taste in the mouth was their initial refusal for me to make a purchase at their gift shop inside park premises..I had wanted to make a purchase as a birthday promise to my son and left this event on the day of check-out but had found the selection at the Hotel gift shop to be limited. Since my son already knew the item he wanted, I made my way to the theme park to request for an entry for the SOLE purpose of buying the ONE item and I'll be on my way.I was refused by 3 different people before someone eventually assisted by calling a shop staff to the gantry. After recounting my predicament again; a lady finally relented and allowed me in to make my purchase. It was over in under 10mins and the 20min delay prior to it was really uncalled for.I had stayed 2 rooms for 2 nights and had 7 combo tickets (albeit for the prior 2 days)This little bit of goodwill for me to make a simple purchase should not have been granted with such difficulty!!Not all was bad at Legoland though..the Treasure chest in the rooms was a nice touchkids had a great time (3 and 7 year olds)water park was great fit for the scorching heatperhaps the heat inadvertently turned the crowds away so waiting times for most rides were manageable.. in fact, we hardly experienced more than 5mins wait (perhaps it was a weekday) and school was re-opening",3.0
3841,Great for whole family with watermark to cool off,"Well run and clean. Did not have long queues for rides.  Would go for the combination ticket on line to enjoy the waterpark also as gets very hot. Waterpark very welcoming in the afternoon with good variety of slides.  Get there early as quieter and easier to get on the rides.  Lego to buy expensive especially when compared to US Legoland, did not buy any. Food inside the park usual junk food but you can go outside where there are more food outlets.  You cannot take food inside and bags are checked. Take swimming stuff and leave everything in a locker at the watermark then you do not have to carry around all day.",4.0
3842,Enjoyable outing......,We had a great time at the park and water park here. Both are fun places but very difficult to cover in the same day.......................... especially if it is raining like the day we were there.They do not allow any outside food so be careful and i suggest to carry nothing but the bare essentials as if not you will be required to hire a locker and make extra payment. Also the legoland hotel is very costly so i suggest the Pariss Hotel or something similar in Johor.Great and fun day with the kids.,5.0
3843,More fun for young kids. Extremely hot.,"Do get the 2-day combo park ticket if you can. It allows multiple entries into both Legoland and the Water Park. There were 2 rides in Legoland which will get you wet. The staffs won't let you on if you wear ponchos. So we wore our swimming costumes on the next day and went for the 2 wet rides when the park opened. As hotel guests get in 30 minutes earlier at 9:30 am, there were no one queuing after us. The staffs let us had repeated rides without getting off. After that, we went to the Water Park.If you want to beat the crowd in the early morning, cross the park through Miniland in the middle to get to the attractions in the inner part of Legoland. Most people start from the rides nearer to the entrance, which are the Wave Racers and Boating School.There's not much shade and air-conditioned areas in Legoland, except for the shops and restaurants. So apply lots of sun-block frequently. Soft drinks cost RM5 and bottled water RM3. No water dispensers in the park, bring lots of your own water if you want to save money.",3.0
3844,Kids paradis,"Even without the water park, the main park is a great place to spend a whole day. With walking around the park and stopping at each ride for the kids it takes a whole day to get around the park (on a weekday when there are very short queues to all the rides). Make sure that you bring along a sun hat / sun block as there is no shade. ",4.0
3845,Excellent park for kids.,"Both my 3 and 6 yo enjoyed the park and water park. We were quite lucky to get good weather and less crowd. We were able to join in all the rides with no queues, including the water park.This is my second time to the park and this time round was so much better. There was fewer crowd, and thus we were able to get on to the rides a few times even. Staffs were extremely friendly and helpful!Though it got a little hot in the afternoon, and there was very little trees or shade, I guess it was ok for us.Some of the rides were not very friendly for my 3yo though, and she had to just sit and wait for us. Thus the rides , I feel, are more suited for bigger kids. Nonetheless, it was a good trip.water park was excellent and we would definitely visit again. The slides were all great for both adults and kids!we had a very good time in both parks, spread over 2 days:)",5.0
3846,Don't waste time at the water park!,"First, they do not allow you to bring outside food in. I wish they stated it somewhere in the tickets or on their website. It is a water park, for chilling and families to hang out, like a beach. The food inside wasn't great, affordable for Singaporeans, expensive in terms of local prices. Second, the entrance is some small, unsheltered walkway on the left of the theme park. What further exemplified the problem was when it poured when we were there. I'm not sure if Legoland expected their park-goers to be dressed in wet swimwear after they are done with the park? We had showered and despite our best efforts with disposable raincoats and even bought umbrellas from the shop, we were wet by the time we reached the hotel (not even to the mall or car park yet!)If you have been to other water parks in the region, you will feel disappointed a a the rides are fewer and not as thrilling. The tickets don't come cheap, and yet the facilities like sitting areas aren't a lot (they had rows of metal chairs at the wave pool) but not exactly comfortable with no tables where you could eat your food properly. Overall, it will be a fun place but not worth an effort to cross the border to get some water play. We have been to the dry theme park and enjoyed it tremendously. The water park - forgettable. New hotel looks fun for kids, we may return but will definitely look into exploring the dry rides and maybe the water park if we get a good deal on the tickets. ",2.0
3847,Overpriced place with very little things,Not really a place worth re-visit. Not much excitement. Waste of money... Suggest to go RWS instead.,2.0
3848,Best for young children,"We visited on a Sunday in June (end of school holidays). My five year old loved it. I thought it was a little unexceptional. The two roller coasters were fun, rest of the rides not very interesting. It was a very hot day and there is little shade anywhere to be found. There were smokers in the outdoor eating areas which was unpleasant . They advertise  the biggest range of Lego in Asia but there was only one big Lego Friends set to choose from in the store. Fortunately we spent the afternoon in the Waterpark and there was a lot more to choose from in the shop there, so my daughter was happy. Far far more Lego friends in any mall in Singapore  though. Overall unless you have a Lego crazy little one I wouldn't bother. The people were welcoming and the park and toilets clean. We were welcomed in the gate by the character Emmet from the Lego movie which really made our daughters day. ",3.0
3849,2nd visit and it is better than the 1st,"This is my second visit and it is not as crowded as my first visit.  Waiting time for all games is not more than 15 minutes, in fact most are only 1-5 minutes only.  It is more suitable for smaller children than Universal Studios Singapore which is more expensive, more crowded and more suitable for children over 12 years old.",4.0
3850,Great fun at water park & okay for theme park,"My friends, my hubby and I have visited both water park and theme park. We've spent about a half day at the theme parks and took a lot of pictures at the miniland. Those rides are not too exciting as they are intended for kids only.But what surprised us was the great fun at the water park! We all loved the slides - body, tube and spin!! We had great fun sliding down 240 feet!! We did splash and swirl, riding on a shared tube too!! I did enjoy all the rides and slides even I couldn't swim!! A must-go park!!It was too bad that we didn't have the water-proof case and therefore we couldnt take any pictures : (Some tips: -Suggest visiting the theme park in the morning and then hitting the water park in the afternoon-Make sure you have bank notes for using lockers!-Remember to take water-proof camera case/bag",5.0
3851,Great outing for Lego enthusiastic and kids below 12 yrs,"Visited Legoland Malaysia in May 2014.Both my kids (4 and 10) loved the theme park. The park itself is not too big and can be easily covered in a day. The park has five different themes which are in line with their toy series. We were lucky as we went on weekday and the park was empty. The roller coasters are great fun for the kids, though a note of caution, older kids will find them not too scary. The park has some good food joints however the good thing about Legoland is they let you go out of the park. There are few options just 100 meters away (I remember KFC, Burger King, and few local outlets serving Indian, Japanese and even a pan cake house). Thumps up for the park management to give the option to customers. We did eat in the park and found the food to be good.  For the vegetarian cuisine, there are few pizza options near the 4D theatre.The park does get hot (I went in May) and the park has dedicated areas for kids to play with lego. The kids had great fun making cars out of lego and racing them on track with the other racers. Good thing is the indoor section is air-conditioned which give us a great breather. Like all lego land, the middle of the park is for Lego world. They have done a amazing job recreating landmarks of Singapore and Malaysia. We covered the park by 4:00 pm and went to the Legoland water park. All of us had great fun in the various slides and again the slides / rides are kids friendly. The key height is 107 cm for most rides and my 4 yr old had amazing fun. The lazy river with lego blocks was great. The great thing was the tubes for small kids had a base too, so my little one didn‚Äôt have to struggle to hold on to the large tube. Small things that ensure the little ones have a good time.We stayed at the Legoland hotel and so were the last to leave the park.  The park will accept Singapore dollars though they will return change in Malaysian ringgitWe had asked for a pick by the hotel from Singapore and though a little expensive we were happy with the service. Though there are public taxis that go cross the border and work out much cheaper.",5.0

3854,Pleasantly Surprised With the Very Thin Crowd,"We went on a Friday weekend (weekend in Johor is Fri and Sat while Sunday is a work day).  We were very surprised that there is very little crowd in the park.  All the rides had waiting times of 10 mins or less!!  Most of them were half-full and we could just walk right up and ride immediately.  Is this normal?  Has Legoland lost it's shine?  I don't know.Anyway due to the lack of crowds, we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.  We managed to get on all the rides that we wanted to try.  And the children could even do their favourite ride - Beetle Bounce (I think that's what it is called), five continuous times!  No queue, no waiting time!Go and visit now!  It is worth a trip if it is not too crowded.",4.0
3855,Good for kids,"Simple and enough to entertain the young kids.Food - price is ok but the pictures are expensive. RM$50 per pc which is over-priced for my opinion. However, currently they have promo at buy 1 get 1 free, not so bad.Honestly, things are not cheap esp at waterpark, they charge one pic for RM$50 (no promo)We went at 0930hrs and could leave around 4pm. No rush.",4.0
3856,Not worth the visit,"Not worth the visit! Few rides and too hot, with few trees to provide shade. Not fun and the rides are more suitable for small children. Will not visit again. Don't waste time to visit, not worth the trip!",1.0
3857,Travel is a shocking experience,"I haven't got into the park yet but including a taxi in Singapore then thru customs then a bus to Malaysian customs then another bus to Lego land, it has taken 2.5 hours. And the same on the way back. If advertised correctly we would never have bothered coming. ",1.0
3858,theme park for young kids,"This is my 2nd time to legoland. It's a great theme park for young children between 6 to 12 years old or taller children as most rides are suitable for this age group and with a height requirement (say 100 - 120 cm). Waiting time is reasonable and mostly very fast except the 4D movie and motor car learning/ driving centre. Entrance ticket is reasonable and probably cheaper to buy annual pass if you visit couple of times in a year. A good 4 hour will probably be enough to cover all the rides and some shows. However, it's too hot and tiring to enjoy much. It would great to spend some good time enjoying air-conditioning in the restaurant next to the 4D movie theatre and watching all the 15 minutes short 4D movies.",4.0
3859,Trip for family with kids,"There are not much rides for adult but consider a lot for kids (aged 6-14 maybe). When I visited Legoland the weather is extremely hot but I bring along an umbrella so it helps a lot. There were a few rides that could possibly get wet, bring along an extra outfit. Bring along a disposable raincoat or you can find it in their store, it cost RM12 each. The staffs are friendly.F&B is expensive not very but a few ringgit extra compare to usual price of the item. Taste of the food is just average, not too bad not too good and some tasteless. The queue is not long, most probably it is a low season period. Not much choice of souvenir but lot of variety for one choice. Parents with kids along  will be busy looking for their kids as their kids will become extremely excited. The parking area and the entrance is about 10 minutes walking distance, quite far. Just right in front of the entrance there are a few restaurant and fast food outlet can be found. The Legoland hotel is right next to it. ",3.0
3860,Way to hot and everything is costly,the wet park was nice but the place itself was to hot!! plant more trees please or at least put some water dispenser instead asking people to buy a RM5.00 mineral water!! the staffs was friendly and cooperative towards the visitors.,3.0
3861,B'day Badge is so special,"This school holiday I go to Malaysia (Johor Bahru) and Singapore with my friend families and my families.I plan to go to legoland to celebrate my daughter's b'day. I have no idea what should do to surprise her.And I saw that legoland staff clapping hands and singing bday song to someone.So I tell one of their member that its Tiffany's (my daughter's name) bday today.They asked Tiffany to come to the office and they singing 'bday song to her, and give her a badge.And what makes this badge special was all of the staff that in the playground when they see this badge said Happy bday and Tiffany could get Tiffany still could play the blast after blast even it's already closed. I made special request to the staff please let her come in because today its her b'day...the staff call her and telling her I let you come in, because today its your b'day...what a special b'day badge",5.0
3862,Great place for the kids,"Most of the rides are for kids, only a few for adults. The theme park is divided into 7 parts, namely The Beginning, Lego City, The Miniland, Adventure land, Lego Kingdom, Imagination and Lego Technic. We watch some performances in Lego City and it was just so-so, however the show at the Castle is fantastic, my kids love the show very much. It was entertaining and funny performance from the Magician. Can you believe it, my kids drag me to watch the magic show  for 3 times. Thumbs up for the show.It was so hot at the park, so is better to bring your water, umbrella, sunblock, hat and wear loose clothes. More shading areas are needed and mist fans will be great at the park especially at the seating place at castle area, as the heat really unbearable when we are watching the show there.If you love photography, Miniland is the best place for you. It's awesome. overall, its a place worth visiting when you are in JB.",4.0
3863,hot hot place but cool for kids,"Last came in 2012 and told myself I wouldn't come again. Fortunately, I was persuaded by my kids and found the park has matured and more pleasant now.While it is not comparable to Oceanpark or HK Disneyland, it is now nicer to visit. The trees have grown and many more shelters providing some respite from the heat. The novelty has worn off and hencethe queues are shorter. In some rides, you don't even queue. The waterpark next to it has probably taken away some of the crowds. There are also many other places to buy discounted tickets so you don't need to queue for tickets at the entrance. I am looking forward to seeing the starwars section they are building and hope to see it soon. For a good view of the park, I recommend the tower ride where u can see all this park and the waterpark has to offer.",4.0
3864,Mainly for kids,"Rides are all targeted at kids and it's good for families. Weather here is very hot though so bring along an umbrella, sunblock lotion, and a mini fan if you can't stand such weather.",4.0
3865,Fun place for kids,"My family visited Legoland Malaysia last June 11, 2014.  Kids enjoyed the Driving School.  We purchased a driving license for each kid at RM35 each.  Kids also liked Project X rollercoaster, Merlin's Challenge, Dragon's Apprentice rollercoaster, Lost Kingdom Laser Game and Technic Twister.  We liked the food (combo family meal) served by the fastfood restaurant near Lego Kingdoms area.  The Lego creations at Miniland were ok.  Take note to bring sunblock lotion, hat, extra clothes for kids as the weather does get hot.",4.0
3866,Kids would love it,"Visited the theme park and water park recently with my family. The theme park is divided into 7 areas: The Beginning, Miniland, Lego City, Land of Adventure, Imagination, Lego Kingdom and Lego Technic. The theme park caters to children and so the rides are rather tame except for  a few eg Dino Island (Land of Adventure), Project x and The Dragon (Lego Kingdom). The park is not that big but to try to complete both theme and water parks in a day may be a bit tight especially if you have young children. Trying to rush through both parks may be more stressful then enjoyable. A lot would depend on the crowd/queue situation for a particular day as well.We enjoyed the water park more than the theme park mainly because the heat is quite unbearable for the former. So if you are visiting the theme park, please bring along your sunblock and drink lots of fluid. Both are also essential when visiting the water park.The water park is not that big but it offers enough to entertain the children. The rides are not too scary but they are enjoyable. When we visited there was no queue at all and so we went on rides we like several times. The tide at the wave pool is not as strong as the one in Adventure Cove (RWS, Singapore) but the Joker Soaker is a huge water playground and it is very popular with kids and their parents.For food, both parks offer standard theme park fare. However I do feel that management of the parks has taken feedback and have both improved their food choices and standard and offer better value for money. Our family of 4 had a large pizza, 4 soups, 4 chicken wings, 4 sodas, and 4 fruit cups for RM75.Kids grow up very fast nowadays. Do bring them to LEGOLAND if they so desire as soon they will not be keen on it.",4.0
3867,Fun but hot and humid,"Legoland was fun for everyone. The kids liked the miniature cities and the kiddie activities (esp the Royal Joust, Driving School, Build and Test). For the bigger kids, rides like Project X and Dragon was fun but not wow (Can't compare to to Disney or Universal Studios). The Air-conditioned food areas (ie market restaurant, The Cafe, Pizza Mania) offer respite from the heat. Dont forget to bring the sunblock and a hat coz it really get hot after 11am.   ",4.0
3868,Torture for adults,"The only comfort I got from this visit is that my girls love the place (plus water park), otherwise it's pure torture for the adults. Weather was super hot and humid and since it's a place meant for kids, we did what we can to get the kids excited so they could enjoy to the max since its a holiday for them. Direction for drivers: from tuas, follow the signs and you will make it. Some signs cab be blocked by growing trees so drive slow.Pay for car park before you leave. You will see the machines on your way to the park. perhaps you can park at the hotel and walk over. We wanted to try that but didn't as we missed the entrance to the hotel carpark. Lockers and food kiosks are abundant. BUT, please bring your own food if you intend to plan for 2 parks, for variety sake. At the end of the day, I was so sick of fries, burgers, pizzas that even plain porridge will be heaven.Water park: adventure cove or wild wild wet in sg is definitely better and one doesn't need to travel out of the country. Rides are limited.Verdict: legoland is a Mecca for kids, thanks to the marketing team so it's really a no choice that you still have to bring your kids here sometime or another.  No need to stay in hotel and waste the money. 1 day for both parks is sufficient.",3.0
3869,Dream comes true for Lego-lovers,"It was my first visit to a Lego theme park and I was impressed.We went only for the theme park and left water park for another visit. The theme park itself can be covered in a day, if the queues are manageable. The rides are suitable for families, young children, and there are a few playgrounds as well.In most of the rides there are tables with some lego bricks provided - a nice touch. Figurines, accessories and ornaments scattered around the park are of lego theme - this adds on to the whole experience.The park is clean and well-maintained. Baby room is very good and well equipped with pantry facilities. Staff are friendly and courteous.Strollers are available for rentals and strollers parking area can easily be found.There are plenty of food choices in the park, and the prices are reasonable. Snack bars and souvenir shops can be found easily too. For more options, visitors can always go out to Mall of Medini. As weather is generally very hot, having free water dispensers in the park would be a great addition.Tips:- If you drive from Singapore, go early, in case there's long queue at checkpoints.- Park at Mall of Medini (5 minutes walk to Legoland entrance, and fully covered).- Put on sun blocks generously- Dress lightly- Drink plenty of water",4.0
3870,Let's go once land,"Spent a day here on the way back to Singapore after holidaying in KL. Bought the 2 park combo ticket because we had a better promo rate for the combo ticket.The water park is kinda small compared to Wild Wild Wet in Singapore. It It's not worth visiting on it's own.The theme park is decent with most attractions having almost no queues when we visited. Both our kids enjoyed the driving schools.The rides are ok, many resembling scaled down (read mini) versions of HK Disneyland rides. The ""Lost Kingdom"" ride lacks setting. You just get into a car and shoot at red dots. No story line, no context, no hype. My 4 year old is less than than thrilled.Caught the ""Legends of Chima"" show at the Lego Studio 4D theater. The wind effect does little to enhance the experience. The only effect in abundance is water. It was like sitting through a rain storm. No idea why they had to shower the audience with more water even when the show has ended. The downpour was heavy enough for me to be concerned about my camera which I had been sheltering under my Barmah hat.The park is sparsely shaded, so regular cold drinks was a must. One word of advice, buy ice lemon tea or ribena that comes in a bottle. The other drinks come in smaller cups but cost the same.The hosts there are generally friendly but our last experience in the park was totally marred by insensitive sales staff. We were deciding between several photos to purchase when the sales staff told us to please hurry up because it was already 6 pm. Irritated, we took the 50RM photo rather than the 200RM Lego Brick Wall photo. If I'm going to pay 200RM, it had better be a photo I am totally happy with!All in all, the place feels like an unpolished theme park with the aim to just move the masses through rides and have their photos taken so that photos can be sold. Good for people who want to take some rides, snap some photos and not so concerned about the experience.",3.0
3871,My 1st Legoland Visit,"This is my 1st visit to LEGOLAND, did a bit of reading as I did not to want to stay in LEGOLAND Hotel, in the end I decided to stay in Bukit Indah Princeton Hotel. There are not many reviews on how to come from Bukit Indah without driving, after much reading and this trip, I will strongly suggest your take a taxi from Bukit Indah, it is pretty affordable and easy.... read on.Taxi to/from LEGOLAND...The friendly Indian lady staff at Princeton Hotel counter had helped to call me a cab to Legoland in the morning, pretty quick, driver at doorstep in about 10 minutes. The taxi was from Public Cab (Tel: 07-2413111), run by meter, cost me RM12-13, took ~10 minutes to reach Legoland. I was not familiar with the taxi companies here, but all Public Cab seems to be in RED color. The friendly Indian lady was rather knowledgeable and told me NOT to take those cab in BLUE at Legoland when I leave in the evening, true enough, I found out that it will probably cost me double. You must be very lucky if you can see a RED taxi waiting at the Medini Mall outside Legoland, but there are plenty of BLUE taxi, thus I call the Public Cab in both the evenings when I am done with Theme and Water Parks respectively, the taxi arrived pretty quick too, approx 15 minutes wait. I think most of the drivers speak some English at least, so no worries. I think there is a public bus (SL1) back to Bukit Indah, but only operate on weekends or public holidays (google Causeway Link website).Legoland Theme Park...Amazingly huge compared to Genting Highland Outdoor Park, I would think you need a full day to cover, depending on the line and season you go. It is probably more suitable for kids age 4-10, minimum height for many rides is 1.02m. Project X probably is the most 'heart drop' ride in the park.Do google and find out what is really good for your kids, I would suggest you keep those with more shades for the hot and humid afternoon, like the train, tower, 4D movie, Lost Kingdom Anyway, it will take a couple more years before the trees can provide better shades, ie DO NOT forget your suntan lotion and bring plenty of water. If you are a photography guy, save some time in the late afternoon for the Miniland, shooting silhouette when the sun is setting down would be nice. Legoland Water Park...If you think there is little shades in Theme Park, then this Water Park will probably has no shade at all, maybe‚Ä¶ at the Wave Pool area, if you can find a seat. It is relatively smaller than the Theme Park. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, it is not small either. The slides have plenty of options, from challenging to milder for younger kids, from family to solo fun, etc. I like the one located at the highest/furthest from entrance, Slide Racer, where you can race down the slide with kids and family. The Joker Soaker is very exciting when the big pail splash down the water....LunchOutside food/beverages are not allowed into the park, but I think they are more easy going if your bring mineral water along with you. Note that they do check your bags at the entrance, especially in the morning. There are many eateries within the Theme Park, but only 2 in the Water Park with limited selection. Yes, price is definitely steeper than outside, but I would say it is still slightly cheaper than Genting Highland First World Mall. We ate curry chicken at Asian Deli in Theme Park, cost RM15 per combo set, comes with a drink and some cut fruits. Anyway, you are allowed to get out of the park (was told once) to have your lunch at the Medini Mall, can‚Äôt say it is a big mall, but there are still plenty of options at a lower price tag. I don‚Äôt know if there more options besides this mall, anyway if you drives, you will definitely have, but why bother and waste time, do remember your ticket is very costly and you should value your time and enjoy the parks.LockersThere are many lockers in both parks, but I don‚Äôt really think you can but a big luggage in it, but rather for those daypack, and it is not cheap. You may consider one to keep your tripod (min height at 60cm, with ballhead attached), but you need the large one, ie RM40/day. I will not suggest you bring a tripod into the Water Park, it is too crowded for you to setup, and you are risking your camera if some kids bump into it.HotelI never get to go to it famous Hotel, can't comment. I have written another review on Princeton Hotel, you can take a look if interested. Have a good trip and fun at LEGOLAND :)reviewed on 18 June 2014",4.0
3872,Awesome place but no money changer ,"We went to Legoland via Singapore. We spent a lot of time lining up at the immigration centers. When we got there, there is no money changer. We were so hungry but we can't purchase anything because everything is sold in local currency. The park is very nice. Even though we are all adults when we went there, we all enjoyed the stay.

I would like to suggest to the management that they have a special ticket for maids as they don't get to enjoy any rides as they are taking care of the baby most of the time...Thank god for the water park, though as my son gets his fare share of the fun...All in all...It was an enjoyable and fun trip....!!!",4.0
3876,For Lego Fans,"Went on a week day. There were people walking around doing the rides. But the Q is best!Almost no Q or longest is 15 min (for Chima show and Boating School , Driving school) The rides are good for children between 6 to 12 ( to enjoy most thrill rides) . we rode onDragon 3X  , Project X 3 times with our two kids. My 5 yo did Dragon 3 times, and she is enjoying to her MAX. I also prefer Dragon to Project X as it has less jerking effect :) It is really hot in Lego land, we bottom up our plain water and drank 3 rounds of cold soda to qunech the thrist and cool down the body. A enjoyable trip if you go during off peak, like me",4.0
3877,Not worth the trip to Malaysia,"This was a disappointment. The place sure is nice, although childish and on the sparse side. Construction was still taking place on a large part of the place during our visit. It should be a very good place for kids once it is fully completed and operational. The rides were unexpectedly good, considering the fact that they look like it was meant for kids. Still, our group of 5 young adults were left quite bored towards afternoon. Not worth the trip to Malaysia coming from Singapore, especially if you have been to Universal Studios already.",3.0
3878,Great Fun,I went with an 8yr old and 11yr old.  Both were very happy at the end of 7 hrs.Went on Monday so crowd wasnt too bad.  Didnt have to wait too long for rides.Plenty of drink places and food stops. We ate at Kings Grill and it was delicious.Best value lego to buy is right at the end.... you can fill a bag from different tubs of lego pieces at a PickaBrick shop. 50RM or 100RM.  We only did the dry park.  Good value for money and entertainment.   ,5.0
3879,Entertaining for families,"Took 2 day combo pass to legoland. First day went to water park. Although the water park is not huge, it is still fun to just soak and relax. The rides were all ok. Didnt queue that long too. Day 2 , to legoland. Manage to finish the whole park in a day as the queue to some of the rides was not long. Kids who love lego will be enjoying as there were places for activity n building them. Overall the park was ok with facilities are well maintained. Will go again in future.",3.0
3880,Family theme park,"Located a newly developed area, This theme park is divided into 2 sections (wet & dry). There is a theme hotel but the staff are not well versed in customer relations and trying to get repeated customers hence I'm not recommending this hotel.The rides in the dry section are as thrilling as what you find in Disney land or Universal studios.The wet section however is the crowd pleaser. Numerous slides, water rides and a pool which caters for all ages.The park lacks shaded resting areas and outdoor cooling facilities (cooling spray mist)Friendly tip: sun block and an umbrella is a must, spend the most time cooling off at the wet park and if your a lego fan, do visit the Brick Shop",3.0
3881,My kids just LOVE Legoland!!!!,"Dont go during the Malaysian and Singaporean school holidays its JAMMED packed.Best ride Project X, those with heart problems dont try it!!",5.0
3882,To be young again,The weather on our visit was sizzling hot just like Legoland which was truly hot. It made us feel young again seeing all the amazing attractions of the land of Legos. My 8 year old niece was so fascinated by the place that she was begging us to return the next day.,5.0
3883,Kids loved the place,Very enjoyable for the kids... parents... not so much... just another activity you would like to do with the kids and for them... not much for yourself.. ,4.0
3884,A place that kids will enjoy,"We traveled from Singapore ( WTS travel coach ) to Legoland by bus the cost is SGD11 for one way, we bring all our luggage because were going to KL after. I really love the miniature decor made by all the lego but the place need to improve their sounds system.",3.0
3885,Truly a land of Legos!,"First time been to a theme park like this. As a great Lego fan, this is the place that I want to be. Overall it was an awesome experience! All in fare for such an amount of entertainment and park rides truly worth the price but actually the games/fun are mainly meant for children, but what the heck? We adults can enjoy as much as a child can do! The Lego shops are fantastic. The part I loved the most is the ""pick a brick"" concept where you literally choose your own Lego bricks and it will definitely kick start your creativity desire to build and design Legos.",5.0
3886,Short Trip Legoland,"Sunny days plays a great part of the trip.In June we went after the local ach holidays causing a great diff, the Q to the rides were minimal n kids enjoy the overall experience n few thrill rides, like The Dragons, Project XXX Technic, ..... Soaking experience in the water ride but it was great fun. Kids enjoyed it n the endlesss LEGO shops, all the entire crew n staff was polite n respectives.....Overall experience is great fun n great weather likewise. I recommend for parents with young children to try it.",4.0
3887,Not so impressed...,"Legoland Malaysia didn't impress me as much as the other famous theme parks. The 4D show was just okay (the chair didn't seem to move), street parades and activities were few and production-wise wasn't really that spectacular. But the rides were new and the park was fairly clean. Most of the rides are suitable for children. How to get there?- For convenience, purchase online ticket from Singapore Flyer direct to Legoland and/or Hello Kitty Land. It would cost around sgd65 (transportation and entrance fee to the park). - Our trip from Singapore Flyer to Legoland took more than 3 hours because of the heavy traffic at both the Singapore and Malaysian immigration. Hence, we spent more time traveling to JB and going through strict immigration procedures than we were at the park.Other insights:Singapore dollar is accepted throughout the theme park.Several food options but nothing special.We went on a weekend in June and there's not much queue, so we did save a little time.Souvenir shops are abundant but items are a little costly.",3.0
3888,Touched by Amazing People,"Arrived around 11 am by car and started from the theme park. Impressed by all the lego made decoration within the theme park. the signage within the theme park is sufficient but a bit too small to read from far. Not much people on queue that day and we ride all the ride for adults and roller coasters.The 4D movie theatre is bit smelly but is acceptable since we only sit in for a few minutes. We had our lunch at one of the restaurant in the theme park (beside the 4D theatre), the food was just fine but we did enjoy. We proceed to the water park after lunch. It was fun and there was a lot of seat prepared for people to rest around that area.Most of the staff at Legoland are amazing. Almost everyone put on smile all the time. they made us feel welcome and  can feel that they really enjoy what they are doing. Especially before their closing time, there were some people singing at the entrance to bid farewell. I sat on one of the chairs nearby and really impressed by their performance. Can feel that almost everyone pass by enjoyed the performance. The (Monkey Man) and some of the other staff joined the performance as well. Can feel that they enjoy to perform and It is not just a job but to make other's visit memorable!",4.0
3889,Great Place for the kids,Great place for the the kids to enjoy - you have to be able to walk around a lot during this visit. Interesting visit especially the miniature Lego Park,4.0
3890,great place for kids,"We went there on a weekday, and from Singapore (WTS travel coach from Singapore Flyer). the trip was 1:30 door to door. not bad on a weekday. (but prices is expensive, about S$40 per adult, round trip, taking the causeway bus is much cheaper, but having a coach door-to-door is hassle free) The place is big, but not huge. some of the attractions are mild, but for 6-10 year old, they are great. I enjoyed the mini-land, they look amazing. We didn't get to see the Star-Wars mini-land, which is being prepared now. There is a lego class your kids can take, but they will have to be at least 8 year old. as with any theme park, long line up to rides really kills the fun, so best to go there on a weekday if you can.",4.0
3891,Overly priced,"Legoland looks great. Little kids will love it but older than 8, there's not that much to do. If you're there for the theme park side of things, the rides are all for very young children and are very short - plus side is, the queues are also short. The 4D movie was fun as was the movement of a robot with computer controls (an indoor activity). The highlight is the mini- lands area with the replicas of famous world sites absolutely amazing. Very impressive and an extensive display. This is what we came to a legoland for, not so much for the rides. But every purpose us different. My summary? Quite expensive for what's on offer. I don't think I'd ever make the trip (from KL) specifically again.",3.0
3892,Going to Legoland Malaysia from Singapore,"It was a hassle going to Legoland Malaysia from Singapore, but we did enjoy the trip. From Jurong east MRT station, we boarded the Causeway Link Bus going to CIQ(Custom, Immigration and Quarantine) and paid the ticket for 4 SGD/Adult and 1.50/SGD child, you'll get free ticket for a child 5 years old and below, just look for the CW3 line. When cleared by the immigration, we went to Causeway Link Bus line at the last station to the right, you do not need to pay again, just board any Causeway Bus that goes to that station. The bus directed us to Malaysia Immigration, it was quick. Then, we boarded the bus going to Legoland, we just asked someone from Causeway Link Bus (you'll see this sign JP02), they were in orange uniform. I would suggest to leave the hotel at the earliest as it was very confusing. We left the hotel at past 7 am and we ended up arriving in the Legoland at 12 noon. It was raining and I am with my four children (ages 5,6,9 and 13). Though, we didn't have much time to enjoy the park due to we're running out of time and the annoying rain, it was still very exciting. We have bought our combo tickets online, Theme Park & Water Park, so didn't bother to go to the ticket center. Anyway, there were only few people in the line. The kids enjoyed the driving lesson, they gave them certificate after. They also love the Boating School and spend few minutes at The Shipyard. We acted as firemen in Rescue Academy and went directly to Land of Adventure. What amazed us was the MINILAND, my two boys almost dropped their jaws. There were also few rides kids will love and so the adults, enjoy!Time for swimming at the WATER PARK! We ride every slides and my most favorite was the Slide Racers, done it 10 times! There were also fastfoods and they were okay.The only thing we didn't like about this trip was our hotel near JB Central. It was very far from LEGOLAND and the bus to the hotel was a 3-hour trip. The nearest hotel is Traders Hotel or better yet stay at the Legoland Hotel and take the two-day ticket instead of the combo for one day. Aside from that, JB Central is 45 minutes away from the airport by Taxi and more than an hour by bus. We paid 70 MYR for the taxi fare and that's all in. Though, there's a bus going to the airport, it has schedule so you better watch for your flight and the shedule of the bus. All in all, it was very tiring but we had fun. We'll surely coming back! :)",4.0
3893,Great family day at Legoland,"We had a really good day of fun with the family. Our kids are 7 and 11 and the activities were perfect for them. Older kids would still enjoy the waterpark but the other rides might be a bit tame, but our 11 year old had a fab time. The park was of a reasonable size and we could have spent a bit longer to explore in particular the waterpark. There were hardly any waiting for any of the rides which was great. However, the WTS trip there from Singapore took 3 hours rather than the 90 minutes we were expecting, the trip home was faster but it still took 2 hours. The shops were a bit expensive, definitely priced for tourists.",4.0
3894,Great for little kids and kids at heart,"Legoland is really suited for young kids, the rides are more friendlier to the young ones but there are also rides for those who are looking for some thrill. The Lego park features cities around Asia but mostly of Malaysia. There are a lot of places inside Legoland where you can have your photos taken and if your lucky enough you'll get to see characters from the Lego Movie. ",5.0
3895,It's all LEGOOOO!!!,"This was our 2nd visit to LLM. Counter staff were a little ""blur"". Firstly, they didnt inform us of a new promotion where you can buy 3 annual passes and received a 4th FOC - especially when there were FIVE of us at the counter! They came up with loads of excuses. Secondly, they didnt tell us that we could pay with 0% instalment! They need to work on their marketing / customer service. Coincidentally, when I was there, there was another man asking about the same thing, where he bought 3 annual passes and didnt received a 4th FOC as he had a child below 3 but is he expected to buy another annual pass when his child is 3? Grey area....Oh, and the photographer was a little not so child-friendly. She looked at my child and said, ""How old is the big one?"". Aiks! Could be better phrased I feel. Needs some people's skills. A lot of the rollercoaster rides had photos taken and though they were good, they were pricy. RM50 for 2 pieces. If they lowered it, Im sure everyone will buy. Again, how they market the photos.Shopping... shirts were cheaper than last year. It was RM90 and now its RM50. Bought a few for the kids. LLM did not have a lot of stock on a lot of items. Would be good it LLM had items that couldnt only be found there. Now, we see all these items (at a much cheaper price) in other Lego certified stores in KL. Again, its how they market LLM. If there are proucts which only LLM has, am sure they would have a lot of visitors. Another disappointment was the Pick A Brick. There was no variety. When we asked, staff said they have not restocked. Could take 3 months or so. For a huge theme park, you would expect restocking on a monthly basis?Other than all THAT, we had a GREAT time! Rides were fun. We went on the ""wrong"" (more scary) dragon ride instead of the ""Baby"" Dragon rollercoaster. Kids had fun. The Driving School used to give the kids a drivers licence when they have passed their ""test"". This time round, LLM decided to charge each child RM35 for each drivers licence. No doubt previously was just a namecard size card which you and handwrite their names, but this time, you need to pay for each child. Money making gimmic. If they charged RM10 i wouldnt have minded - and plus they would have more takers. Most parents just skipped that part.I personally LOVE Legoland - but a lot of improvements are required in the areas above to maintain the expected standard for this amusement park. Rides are kids friendly, which is the main point of the visit. Have fun!!!! :)Closing time at 6pm is a little early... We would like to visit in December and when we visited LLM's website, they only had the calendar up until August 2014! More planning is required. Especially for overseas visitors who need to plan early!",4.0
3896,Kids love it,"My first visit and last visit was on June 2014. We went by Wednesday not too many people. The park is smaller if compare with Disneyland Hong Kong. It's 4D movie not really 4D if compare with Sea World in Gold Coast. The gifts shop pricing is all for tourist rather for local, very expensive, eg. T-shirt is cost RM50 above. The weather is too hot for me even as a local like me.  But it's not a big problem for kids. They just love the games and play many times because no need to queue very long time.",3.0
3897,"Worth a visit, eat outside food. ",Organised a transfer with WTS Travel from Singapore which also including park entry for 126sgd for an adult couple. Pick up location was from the Singapore Flyer and travel time was about 90 minutes including immigration. Was tipped to go ok the weekdays as the weekends immigration would take some time however it only took about 10 minutes each way on a Wednesday. Park itself was fun however all you need is a couple of hours and you'll be done. One of the major rides were closed. And lines to the other rides were only about a 5 minute wait. Theme park food isn't that great so a good tip is to get a reentry stamp and go to the mall 40m away and eat nicer and cheaper food. If we had kids they would of enjoyed  it a lot more. ,3.0
3898,Great Park for little ones,Great park but beware of heat and humidity. Try to avoid hot months if possible. Keep hydrated. Coconut water is a great life saver in hot and humid days and is available on some restaurants in the park. My son hates heat and humid environment but the rides for a 3 yr old were so good that he was mostly fine. Take a bus from Singapore don't go by taxi as you may face problem to find a taxi while coming back.,4.0

3901,Awesome themepark even for adults,"We went during the long weekend on Wesak Day in a group of 8 adults. We did not put high expectations as most reviews said the theme park is more suitable for kids. Bought the 1-day combo (theme & water park) tickets online.On the day of our visit; we didnt have to queue/wait so long for the rides. We spent half day at the theme park and after lunch we proceeded to the water park. The rides are fun & enjoyable even for adults. Both parks are well-maintained and clean. Tips: 1. buy the Legoland water bottle for refill (worth it as we spent a lot on cold drinks)2. dont spend to much on pictures/selfies. you can do it after you've enjoyed all the rides. 3. if you buy combo tickets, always remember that it might rain in the evening, so plan your time wisely4. put on your sunscreen & sunnies & enjoy!!!5. for foods; buy combo/value mealOverall, we really enjoyed the rides and it was a weekend well spent with family! And might return as there will be new attractions coming soon.Additional info: We stayed at Homestay Andom at Kulaijaya. Recommended for big family like us. 30 mins to Legoland/JPO. Very convenient area to stay. Shops/mcd/starbucks/old town/sup tulang zz all within the area.",4.0
3902,Suitable for kids and fans,"My family loves theme parks, we've been to most Disneylands, Warner Brothers, Universal Studios. So when a new theme park opened we were immediately up for it. We arrived in Singapore airport and travelled by charted taxi to Legoland. distance-wise it was meant to be a 1 hour drive but adding insane traffic it took about 3 hours in total. The upside was that we didn't have to alight the car at all even at customs.We stayed 1 night at Legoland hotel (will write separate review) and spent the next full day at the park. Tip: PURCHASE YOUR TICKET ONLINE 7 days before, there's a 20% discountWe were a party of 3 adults. We first went to Miniland which is landmarks around the world made from lego bricks. It was quite cute to see but in photographs you can't really tell they're made from lego. We then chose some adult friendly activities such as the observation tower and 4D movie where were quite good.In terms of food, there is your usual hamburgers and pizza and slushies. I must say that the food inside the park were very reasonably priced compared to Disneyland.By 4pm we were ready to call it quits. But as we booked the 7pm bus to Singapore, we went to the lobby of the hotel to enjoy air conditioning and free wifi.Overall, I think that adults can skip this park, young kids seemed to enjoy it, if you do visit, a day trip is sufficient.",3.0
3903,Fun!,Everything was fun. The rides were thrilled enough! All my three kids had a really great time there. We had a good food at the Pizza Mania. There are a lot of attractions and you need to spend one whole day to explore the theme park!,5.0
3904,Good day out,We caught MRT and then bus to causeway then local bus to Legoland took awhile and we went on a Sunday. KFC toilets had no paper. And cleaner at park wiped the toilet seat over with the mop she had just cleaned the floor with. Extremely long trip back as we caught peak hour at causeway. Lots of rides for little ones. Reasonably short waits but unless you have kids with you give it a miss,4.0
3905,Everything is AWESOME!,"Loved our visit so much we are planning a return trip! Travelled with an 8 yr old who is not too keen on rides but LOVES Lego... the park is superb for lots of Lego details and interactions... Chima in miniland was a huge hit, as was the car racing track and the robotics workshop. Got early pass from booking with the Legoland hotel... no queues first thing, so went straight to drving school and boating school but had no really long queues the whole day. Loved the 4D theatre. Only spent a half day at the water park and wished we had longer there... rides were all great fun, no scary ones at all so probably best for younger children or adults who like tame rides!Only drawback at the theme park was issues at Market Cafe waiting for food... they had ""run out of chicken"" for the chicken rice when I went to queue for that, then only 15mins later had ""run out of chicken"" for the roast chicken meals! :/ Don't wait until you (or the kids) are very hungry before going there for food! Or just go across to Medini mall for large choice of food ;)Food issues aside, loved it enough for the 5 star rating!",5.0
3906,Wonderful fun for the kids,"Finally we're able to visit the Legoland, and both parks were wonderful for the kids.I'd rate the water park to be better than the dry park, although it could be probably due to the dry park is really catered for the kids. Not much for the adults, except maybe for Project X and the Dragon (I got spoiled by the coasters in Cedar Point, Six Flags and Busch Garden).The water park's water quality was good. It's clean and doesn't get murky even when the crowd was big, as compared to other water parks here in Malaysia. The rides are awesome and be prepared to queue for the the popular ones. Best to know when is the right time to go to Legoland as it can get quite packed and the queues can be long. We were lucky on the day we entered the dry park, lines were almost non-existent and we could take on the rides as many as we wanted.Food in the parks are unsurprisingly expensive, so be prepared. Otherwise, there are a few decent restaurants in the mall in front of the dry park that you can go for a quick meal before reentering the park.The Legos at the gift shops are good but still no less cheaper than at the normal toy stores. If only the prices are more attractive ..",4.0
3907,Kids will enjoy,"Eventhough the fee is a bit costly, but its worth it especially if you have young kids, they will enjoy most.  Go early, its a bit humid in the afternoon.  Bring umbrella because it can be really hot during midday.There are small malls before entering Legoland.  Lots of eatery and things to shop.",4.0
3908,Suitable for kids,"More suitable for kids. My son enjoyed those rides a lot. It good that rides cater for family as well. You can enjoy those with your kids. Although it school holiday, the queue not that long. Maybe because rides are short. 4d not as great as the one in Disneyland. We sat at the back row of the seat, we can't even feel the effect (e.g. Water spray).  Very hot, not enough shelters. Expensive. Foods are expensive (quality is bad as well). Car park per entry with no shelter (rm7).  The service crews at wet park are more friendly than those service crews in dry park. The wet park is more fun compare to the dry park. Sufficient changing room. Kids will definitely enjoy it especially wet park. But not for adults.",3.0

The lazy rives is nice to relax with float. Overall this place is clean, nice for family vacation & should be visited by everyone. Worth every ringgit spent to enter.",4.0
3913,worth a visit,"We travelled by coach as a day tour from SInagpore and apart from some major delays through customs (due to other passengers going 'missing' it was a great day. It was a long and hot day but we took our 9 yr old and it was well worth the visit. If you buy as a package you must buy for the waterpark also......it was a very hot day when we went and we appreciated the waterpark to allow us to cool down. We hired  larger locker for 20MR for the afternoon - the toilets and changerooms at the water park did leave alot to be desired, but for the amount of people they have through their gates, at least it was provided. Legoland itself - there is minimal shade and some of the lines to the rides were quite long - as my daughter is not a theme park ride lover that didn;t really affect our trip there as she was only interested in the 'look' attractions - which I must say were amazing. She did get her drivers licence when we first got there, but for a 9 yr old, I thought it was a bit childish - her battery operated car here at home moves faster than the ones they are allowed to drive. The park seems to be quite well set out with a variety of food and attractions for all ages/cultures. Cons - we had lunch at the marketplace restaurant and they had a 'travelling' band who serenaded tables while people ate. I found this to be very annoying as they were so loud that you could not hear yourself think (and they then moved to other eateries in the complex). Some of the items in the shops were a bit on the expensive side, but it is a theme park so you do have to expect that.On the whole though, it was a great experience and having a lego loving husband and child, they were in awe and mixed with the water park, we had a fantastic day",4.0
3914,Attractions & Money Value,"We were there as a family of 7 on the 5th of June. Heavy down pour 3/4 of the day. Left to spend our time in the Market Restaurant. It is a small size theme park. Expected equivalent experience to other international theme park as I had been to the Universal Studio in Hollywood and a number of times to Disneyland Paris but, it is not. 1. Ending time and starting time for some of the attractions that does not coincide with the park opening and ending time is not spelled out clearly, i.e 4D last show ends 30 minutes earlier from the park closing time but was not mentioned at the entrance of the 4D. We were there at 6.40pm queuing but left standing for sometime before someone came out to let us know that there is no more show. 2. We asked the shops in the park closing business of The Big Shop at the entrance because that is where you can purchase many more things and was told that it will remain open as long as there are still customers (this is the case if you are in Disneyland, Paris) so I believed the info given but when I arrived at the shop at 7.15pm and there were still customers browsing, we were denied entry at the door by a staff who stood blocking the door saying that they have closed business. There were a few others who wanted to enter as well. Thank goodness that the discount shop set up outside the park main entrance was true to the info given to us that they will remain open until 8pm. We managed to get my daughter's doggy stuff toys there.Food was good although very expensive for locals and facilities were excellent but I was expecting this since it is an international name. Special appreciation to the praying rooms provided, clean and very spacious! not a norm even for a local attraction provider -shame on you! Theme park can be covered within a day easily so I do not think that staying at the hotel is needed. You may want to stay in JB and just travel there for a day outing.Ticket was expensive but unfortunately our weather may caused you to not being able to cover the whole ground in a day - like our experience- so may be the management need to consider what package and because of our uniqueness, it may be prudent long term to look into ways to solve this or else I do not know why I would come back just to ride a few more slides or cover the wet park when I can get those and may be challenging ones in Sunway Lagoon. I have seen the legos..We also though that legoland should also have made bushes and trees from the legos that covered the grounds, that would be awesome!",3.0
3915,Loads of fun,"I was slightly worried about going to Legoland with my son during the June school hols(thought it would be mega busy), but it wasn't that crowded. He tried the driving school, about 15 minutes waiting time and was so proud of his license. We practically breezed through the rest of the rides( the Lego airport, laser gun ride and joust). Managed to watch spellbinder for the 4D movie( the characters don't speak in this one, they did in Clutch Powers). The movie times are on the Lego website. Rain came pouring down around 1.15 but the entertainers at the castle stage did an awesome job of keeping our spirits up. After the rain stopped, we went on the train ride n then to the waterpark, where my son had so much fun, he didn't want to leave. You can rent towels for RM 20 but we preferred to use the dry pod RM 10. There are family changing rooms (I made my son go with me to the ladies changing room) so I would have peace of mind. Lifeguards at the pool very friendly n professional, really looked after the kids' safety. Definitely will be coming back again.",4.0
3916,Wonderful for young children,"We visited Legoland with a 3 year old and 6 year old on a stopover when flying from Europe to Australia. They had a wonderful time, and we were able to visit on a week day out of school holidays so there were almost no queues for any of the rides - the only time we had to wait (and even then, only for about 10 minutes) was for the Project X roller coaster in the Technics area and the Boat School in the Lego City area. My 3 year old is almost 110cm tall and so was able to go on all the rides. The park is very hot and exposed, but when we got too hot we went on the water splash Dino Island ride, or one of the indoor, air conditioned attractions like the 4D cinema and Lost Kingdom to cool down. In the afternoon we visited the Water Park and had a great time, again there were almost no queues, especially later in the day, and we all had lots of fun on the slides and Build-A-Raft ride. This was our first family trip to a theme park or water park, and it will be a hard one to beat - the park is new, everything is clean and works well, staff were friendly and we all really enjoyed it.",5.0
3917,A Quaint theme park,"Went there in March. Amazingly the weather that day was overcast and wew we spared from the heat. Heard from many friends that the heat during the afternoon can be unbearable, especially since there is not much shade and cover. The great thing is that there is almost no need to queue for the rides.  Only a couple of the more pupular rides had a queue no longer than 5 minutes of wait time. The 4-D rides were a bit disapoointing but it could be a good escape from the heat in the afternoon. Wish they had more mascots walking around, apart from the 2 lego movie stars.",3.0
3918,Good fun for kids,My wife and kids enjoyed our trip here. When we went there it was slightly drizzling and the theme park is not crowded. My kids took the rides multiple times and really enjoyed the rides. I really liked the mini land display of various Asian cities. The only attraction we didn't like much is the 3D movie attraction.,4.0
3919,Amazing,We traveled to Legoland for the day from Singapore. Our son had an absolute ball here and so did we. The park is reasonably sized making it easy to see everything in the one day. If visiting from Singapore try www.taxisingapore.com. A round trip is reasonably priced and much quicker than catching a bus.,4.0

3924,Lack of information sign,"This place is suitable for family with young kids only. We went there last year from Singapore then go to JB by bus. The transportation fee was affordable and could be purchase by online. There are many variety prices of buses to go to Legoland and usually if you buy package, they always put it together for Legoland and Hello Kitty. We choose the cheapest price, which is go by separated bus. But the consequences is we have to wait for the bus on the places that doesn't have any information board or any sign of it. After we finished looking around in Legoland, we are heading to Hello Kitty Town. Unfortunately, they never provide the direction directory for the transportation or even bus stop sign. The access was quiet confusing for us. Luckily, after asking here and there finally we could find the bus stop and the bus also. And we could go back again to Singapore from Hello Kitty Town after asking here and there. We are not playing the games because it's too childish totally different with Universal Studio in Singapore, adults can play some of the game. So at that moment, just sight seeing and take a picture. They haven't finish build the entire place also. Too bad :( Hopefully, there's improvement from the management about this issues.",3.0
3925,A wonderful experience had by all,"This was a long anticipated trip to Lego land Malaysia as my 9yo son is a lego fanatic. My daughter doesn't mid it as well, either. Only positive things to say about Lego land itself. Welcoming staff, clean, hardly any ques for the rides (went during off-peak), reasonable prices for food and toys. We bought the water park and theme park day passes online and that was better than paying at the gate. So all in all, very well organized and highly recommended. I would also recommend that you go during peak seasons, so I can go during off peak,...lol.We went there as a day trip from Singapore, although if there is a next time we might stay at least a couple of days at the lego land hotel. That way we will have more time to explore all the attractions. Anyhow, we departed Singapore flyer for Lego land ( with WTS travel coaches) at around 9am and what should have been a trip of 1h even in congested Singapore, took 2 solid hours. The reason? Singapore's border immigration check. The ques were just far too long, and despite there being roughly 5-6 lanes open, there where at least another 8-10 lanes closed. This did cause some distress as we waited in line for at least an hour, not to mention annoyance, as it was cutting into our precious fun time at Lego-land. Malaysian border check was much faster...hard to believe but true. We left Singapore at 9 and should have arrived at Lego-land by 10 but actually didn't until 11. One full hour wasted!!!On the way back to Singapore the process was quicker. It took us roughly an hour and 15 min to travel from Lego-land to Singapore Flyer.Lego-land definitely gets the thumbs up!!! Great place, and great service!!! However, something needs to be done to streamline the border check processes for passengers coming from Singapore for the day. It's really up to Malaysia to act and work something out, because Singapore would be indifferent (or maybe even counter-productive) on this matter, as it is losing valuable tourist dollars to it's Malaysian rivals just over the border. It is obvious why out of all the space in Malaysia they decided to build Lego-land right next to Singapore. Very smart move...but please make the travel process a little easier!!!",5.0
3926,Great for kids / family only,"If you are a family guy or you are bringing kids, I am sure you will enjoy this themepark. If you are planning a date to Legoland, I suggest you replan.This themepark is designed for kids, as there are only 3-4 rides suitable for adults. The park is located at Nusajaya, approximately 15mins drive from JB town / 20mins from Singapore. Not hard to find as it's situated right next to the coastal highway. Parking is chargeable capped at RM 7/day, but if you want free carpark and don't mind walking, park at the back of the park near to a construction side off the road where it's legal to park. Although there were plenty of trees being planted but it's still hot!! Apply all sunscreen / lotion you need to avoid sunburn. Avoid weekend or school holiday if you do not want to spend time queuing up. The Legoland theme park has plenty of activities, from learning how to drive -> fireman rescue -> building lego -> 4D Cinema -> thrill rides etc. You can easily spend the whole day in the park.And if you have limited time, you can totally skip the waterpark, because it's so small!!! Not many rides and not really thrilling. Food can be found in both dry and water park, but it's very costly. Can't remember the exact price, but it's >RM20 for a meal. Lastly, there is a new hotel - Legoland hotel just next to the themepark, catering for international tourists, but it can be pricey as Malaysia standard. Overall, it's good to experience it once, but if you ask me whether it's worth to purchase an annual pass??? Not really unless you have kids if not you won't be visiting another time.",4.0
3927,Suitable for family with young kids only,"Well, the place is great for my family as we have 2 kids in the age between 6 to 8 years old.  The games are very suitable for this range, but it may not so call excited for kids older than 12 and above.The lacking is greenery is really very shortage at the whole park, hope the Management will look into planting more trees and flowers.",4.0
3928,Went on a class trip,Took my class of 11 7-8 year olds to LEGOLAND this week. They have special prices for school trips and were very helpful and communicative before hand. We spent the morning in the theme park and even though there were other schools there (it was a Monday) there were no big queues so we were able to go on a lot of the rides. The kids loved the rides and also enjoyed playing on the play grounds. It was easy to keep an eye on them as the areas were contained. We had lunch and then went to a friction workshop where the kids built lego cars and raced them. Work shop was fun and good for the kids at the start of our friction unit in school. We finished our day out with an afternoon in the water park. Fantastic day! Perfect school trip venue for 7-11 year olds.,5.0
3929,Legoland - Not a Big Park but Overall Not Bad.,"Before going there, I suggest that anyone who wants to visit the park to purchase the tickets online. Sometime you may get some discount if you purchase them earlier but it will save you a lot of hassle in queuing up for the tickets especially during the school or public holidays. If you are driving there for the first time like me, the signs to the parking can be a bit confusing. The main entrance to the park is actually block by a mall. You need to walk through it to get to the main entrance. Once inside, if you go left side you will find the rollercoaster rides... so if those people who wants to go slow first, go to the right side then proceed anti-clockwise. The theme of the mini land is based on cities in Asia...mostly South East Asia. Quite impressive if you like miniature and scaled world. The park is a small when comparing to other parks but I am sure that it will grow from time to time. Prices of food is quite pricey but it is common in all parks. There are a few shops that sells gifts and Lego sets. Take note, the shops sells the sets according to the theme of the area that you are at so the sets may not be sold at the shops at the entrance. Be sure to get the sets you like before leaving the theme area else you need to walk back to get it. The only gripe that I have is the prices of the sets, they are no cheaper then outside. Wish Lego would sell them cheaper. There is a bargain shop outside the park near the entrance which sells old and not sellable sets though. By the way, there is a water park beside the main park for those people who like to get wet. The LEGOLAND hotel is a bit pricey so for those who are on a budget like me, no worries,  there are plenty of reasonably priced and clean hotels nearby.",3.0
3930,Not as good as USS Singapore,The facilities and games available are more suitable for children and under age. Adults might feel a bit boring.,3.0
3931,We enjoyed it!,"Here are the things I liked in Legoland:1. Lines are not too long - we came in on a Friday and by 5-7 pm, there were no lines for the ridesEven on a weekend, the lines were not too long either. Longest wait we had was probably 5 minutes2. there are enough food and drink stations for resting3. There are places where the kids can just run around and play, while the parents can sit, rest, and just watch them go. I especially liked the places where my son could just build duplo towers and test if they were strong enough, and building the lego cars. 4. the hotel allowed early access (9:30 am instead of 10)5. Waterpark was good to combat the heatFor improvement:1. maybe I didnt wait for it but I expect a wave pool to churn out ""big"" waves from time to time, but after being the water for about 15 minutes, only normal waves were produced2. trees are young so it could get hot. The taxi driver explained to me that this was built on a palm oil estate, so the trees are not tall yet. Reviewers are right in saying that one should bring umbrellas. We brought two and it really helped.Its far from JB itself but there is a mall (a small one though) right across it. There is KFC, BK, Pancake House, Chicken Rice shop (good service, food was so-so) and two convenience stores.For a kid I guess that seeing their favorite characters adds up to the joy and excitement. Lego does not have this; so perhaps Lego itself needs to do more in this department.",4.0
3932,Excellent for all the Family,"Had a great day, excellent rides for young and old alike. Friendly helpful staff provided a wonderful atmosphere. It was raining the day we went and we still managed to have a good time.",5.0
3933,Kids had fun,"The water park serves it's purpose, a good plunge to shoo the warm heat of the sun... The kids had a wonderful time on almost all its attractions from the driving school, boating school, etc.IMPROVEMENTS: I wish you could put in more shade as it could really be so hot going around the park.",4.0
3934,A good attraction for the whole family but could be better,"Drove to this place (Southern part of West MY) from KL (distance: around 325 kms for 2.5 hours); arrived just in time for its opening hours at 10 and spent almost the whole day here to make the most of our trip before heading back for the road at 5pm. Experience was relatively pleasant(though some services like the Lego express (train service) were closed then apparently for renovation. Having been to similar attractions before, this one came out smaller and limited in options but is good in its plane than nothing. The miniland is interesting as well as the observation tower and all the mind-bogging lego stuff for kids. May add few more attractive sites to add better value for money and to be worth commuting thatlong distance.",3.0
3935,HOT but Pleasant,"This theme park is very suitable for young children - my 5 yo and 3 yo really enjoyed themselves here, as quite a few rides are catered for them, and they just can't resist the playgrounds.I agree with the other reviewers - Legoland Malaysia sure is HOT, so be sure to apply sun lotion and wear hats/caps. It really helps!The good thing was that the queue wasn't long, so we can enjoy ourselves more without needing to wait too long to ride something. However I notice the queue at the boat driving school are rather long, and actually there are quite a few boats that are unused, so I'm not sure why the staffs were not releasing a few of those unused boats so that the queue can be faster?The 4D movie was quite good. And the Dragon Apprentice is good for young children (5 and above). It's quite thrilling, even for adults, but not too fast. My 5 yo LOVE it so much that he rode it 4 times!And I really love the fact that there are cute lego characters everywhere, so a lot of photo taking chance here!We only tried The Market Restaurant - the food is not bad and not as expensive as we thought.",4.0
3936,Interesting...,"For Malaysian...for us..to have one of those international brand theme park in our country - is indeed something that we should be proud of.  Although some people may comment that it may not be as good or as big as those in the overseas..but I guess...it is a good beginning (although one cant deny that the water park is kinda a bit small lah ya...for an international brand..)Furthermore, we can see that it is enhancing it's service and things now and then.  Adding in more miniatures building from time to time. Intend to stay at the hotel but failed to get a room as it was fully book (my second trip here...)However...one thing which I noticed (compared my 1st and 2nd trip)..some of the animals or insect miniatures was taken away.  Such as the bees, spiders and the butterflies that were displayed on the tree stumps.  If I am not mistaken, even the musical instrument that were made out from lego was not on display anymore.  U can still hear  the music but unfortunately..nothing for you to be amazed at.  Hopefully, something can be done about this.Oh ya...the floor at the water park...is really slippery.  During my 2nd trip there, can clearly see many people fell down...including yours truly here.  Generally, I will rate it as good....but if to compare to Universal Studio and Sunway Lagoon...a bit left behind.....",4.0
3937,Great for kids,"Go during off peak to enjoy the park. Give it a full day. Buy a combo ticket so you can go cool off at the water park after having fun at the themepark.Buy the slushie but do not sling the bottle as it will unlatch and the bottle will drop and crack. Get your kids the lego driving license from the lego driving school. Get your photo in lego form from the water park.Food at water park ie the fried chicken is really tasty.Bring big bottles of water, sunglasses, cap, brollies, spf.",4.0
3938,Absolutely Amazing with 3-Year Old Son,"We traveled here on a Saturday with a 3-year old. We got here about 11:20AM and stayed right to the 7:00PM closing. It is not often we‚Äôre able to do such a long day with a small child, but this park was absolutely perfect for that.  First a warning: while there is travel agents around the area, and touts outside the gate that sell tickets for less, these tickets do not include the water park which I find to be an absolute must. The water park has a great changing and shower area that has lockers for rent. A small locker was 20 ringgit for a full day, and you can open and close it as often as you‚Äôd like. It right near all the attractions, so going back to get money for food, also bringing back our camera to take photos etc. this came in handy.This water park has activities for all ages, and I suggest doing it first as we did. It is not so much a thrill water park, but rather a place that has a ton to do with families and small children and does have some larger slides adults will enjoy too. This includes a river pool that can travel along in a tube that has floating legos, a big play park with water splashing all over, a wave pool, smaller kids slides and much more.Once inside the main park there is plenty to do. The section called Imagination was the most suitable for families with small children. The skydeck ride is really cool where it takes you up in the air and rotates around for a view of the park. My 3-year old son‚Äôs favorite ride was Beatle Jump. I‚Äôm a big guy but was able to sit on the adult seat included on the ride, and wow for a ride a 3-year old can go on this really tickled my stomach. He went on this 5 times! Going back and forth around closing and there was hardly a line. Had the park been open later he‚Äôd have done it many more times as it took a fight to drag him away.While it was a bit pricey to get in, from there most everything is included, and the admission price was worth every penny. The extras are all reasonable priced. For example branded Legoland hats as souvenirs that are good quality were just 25 ringgit. The food was reasonably priced too. Three of us filled up for 48 ringgit and had plenty of food, that we packed some of it up to snack on a bit later.Outside the park there are some restaurants and shopping leading in to. We didn‚Äôt have time to do that, or to even visit all the rides. While we only had a day, for those with more time I‚Äôd suggest buying the two day pass. This was a lot of fun and I can‚Äôt wait to go back. My son just turned 3 is in a multilingual (3 language) home and thus a little slow learning to talk. But a word he knows now is Legoland! He keeps repeating it, says it when looking at photos, and the night after our visit actually slept with a smile on his face. Absolutely perfect! I loved this place.",5.0
3939,Expected more for the brand name - LEGO!,"If it is sunny weather, you will easily get roasted. Don't forget the sunscreen lotion and the handheld battery operated fan (these will come really handy). There are 2 gated areas - Waterpark and the LEGOLAND itself. The park is designed for Lego lovers and also suitable for teens (I doubt young children can appreciate it as much). Not much entertainment for the adults though apart from the Miniland attractions. The park pretty much attracts the domestic market hence it is best for tourists to come on a weekday if you would like to enjoy the experience without queuing for too long for the rides etc.",3.0
3940,"Really kewl, but REALLY HOT at the same time","This park is great.  The exhibits are fairly new so they aren't faded like those in the older parks - yet. What lets it down is the heat and lack of shaded areas.  I love the heat and even I found it a little hard to deal with here.  It does have the advantage of a water park being attached to it, so I would suggest taking your swimmers along and spending the hottest part of the day there.  The Miniland at this one is really something.  The Petronas Towers are excellent.  One thing to keep in mind if you're staying in Singapore - it can take HOURS to get to and from.  This is mostly dealing with traffic, immigration and customs coming back into Singapore however.",4.0
3941,For lego-lovers,"Been here twice. As a lego-lover, I enjoyed my first visit (during soft opening). However, there were not too much improvements during my second visit (except for the newly built hotel). Worst, more rides were closed/under maintenance. Know the attractions.

3945,Loved every minute of it!,We travelled from Singapore to Legoland Malaysia.  Enjoyed the atmosphere and environment as my being an AFOL - could not stop the big grin on my face when I was walking through Mini-land.  The rides and food were more kid oriented but a good distraction from the heat on the day we went - bring/buy water and a good hat.  The only small disappointment was the lack of the newer and larger Lego sets (that are available on Lego's own online shop) in the store.  A very enjoyable day out.,4.0

3953,Great!,"Managed to went to more rides as compared to last year (as last year some rides are down), and with good planning, we did not suffer as much sun this round. Sunblock is a MUST and bring your own ponchos and umbrella if you want, otherwise the shops sell too. Rides are not crowded and efficient staff make the queues go fast. Staff is also friendly and when we asked questions on directions and places to go, they give recommendations. I like the auntie at the Driver school shop who give good recommendations.Love the Waterpark and the service staff at Waterpark are so friendly and go the extra mile to help. Had a enjoyable time at the waterpark. Thanks to the staff who really go around finding my husband spectacle when he lost it in the Build-a-raft waters. And I like the staff in the shop who is friendly to locate straw for my drink.But there was a bunch of Kindergarten kids who went in the legoland waterpark playground and they dash around and make the whole place so crowded that we went off to other areas. Moreover they did not come dressed in swimsuit and were wearing their uniforms, The Kindergarten teachers should have better planning and the Waterpark staff should stop them since they are not wearing proper swimwear.

3958,Not worthwhile compared to Singapore amusement parks,"As part of our Singapore holiday, we were looking forward to visiting Legoland across the border in Malaysia. However, the trip turned out to be a dampener from the word go.We (two couples and three boys) had missed booking the bus tickets at the time of booking the Legoland tickets. The WTS counter at Singapore Flyer is amongst the most inefficient. As a result we could not take the 930 am bus despite being there at 920. Finally took the 10 am which left at 10:10 am. Took 1.5 hours to reach Legoland including getting down twice for immigration checks (Sing & Malay).The sun was scorching our backs. There was very little shade. However, we soldiered on with the boys getting excited seeing the number of lego sets available in the shop. Started on the right side with Lego City, which was a waste for the 7 & 8 year olds. Only the 4 year old enjoyed it.The areas which had some rides worthy of the visit were in the Imagination, Technic and to some extent the Kingdom's sections. The Technic section also has a 45 min class for Lego Mindstorms which might be interesting for the kids.Among the rides, Project X, Dragon (roller coaster) and the Aquazone Wave Racers are some of the better ones.Food is a disappointment, especially for veggies who only have a tomato-cheese pizza and a pasta as options.Overall, an OK place but not worth spending 3 hours of travel time and skipping one of the parks at Singapore to go for this. Probably the heat did us in as well, but i doubt if i would change my view even if the weather was better.",3.0

They have a lot of attractions for kids so they had a good time. They did the attractions for small kids but also went for the roller coasters and had a blast.The bad point about it is you feel like Legoland is trying to milk us for every dollar we have in our pockets. We bought the yearly passes and found out we cannot use it to go to water park, we need to pay extra.Overall, if you ddon't pay attention to the money going out and think your kids happiness is worth it, then it is a great place to spend a day with family.The hotel is super expensive and without breakfast...ridiculous.The best way is to stay in a smaller hotel in Johor.",3.0
3963,So So,"So me and my friends were dying to visit Legoland Malaysia, since it's the nearest Legoland from Indonesia, our country. We took WTS Bus for return trip to Legoland from Singapore Flyer. When we arrived, we were so excited to finally be here and taking pictures in front of its big signage, couldn't wait to play inside. We really love the miniatures made of legoland. But we are a little disappointed by the rides. I think it's more suitable for children under 15. I was hoping to find more of a thrilling ride, and The Dragon wasn't operate that day, so yeah.. that is unlucky for us. We manage to boost up our mood by shopping at the merchandise shop, some of them are cheap, some of them just too pricey. I think if you're choosing between Legoland Malaysia and Universal Studio Singapore, you better visit the latter. I had so much fun in USS back in 2012 though Battlestar Gallactica was closed (up til now), they have rides for children and they have thrilling rides too for adults.",3.0
3964,Interesting but more for small children,"Nice rides, many games are for small children. So, it may be less amusing to some. Weather can be really hot ... Wear sunscreen.Look out for the Star Wars event.Nothing is cheap - fnb.Many good photo opportunities with life size Lego figurines.",3.0
3965,boys loved it,The sessions where they get kids to perform tasks were very informative and fun.  The small cities are very pretty. The rides were mostly for younger children. I enjoyed the ride where you get to shoot with laser guns the most.,4.0
3966,Sad to leave,We travelled to legoland as part of our trip from Singapore up into Thailand through Malaysia. We decided to take a taxi (my trip transport) after reading about the lengthy and troublesome bus trips of other travellers and it was definitely the right way to go!! $90 and they picked us up at our hotel at the agreed time - 1hr and 07 later we were standing at the hotel lobby. Customs was a breeze - we gave the driver out passports and that was it. The officers looked into the car at us then our passports and we were away again. For us it was definitely worth the extra expense!!My children who are 12 & 8 loved the park and over the course of our two day tickets we went on everything except the mindstorm part. I had read numerous reviews complaining about the lack of shade so we were well prepared with sunscreen & hats but found that other than the mini city everything had shade close by. The water park was fantastic and specific mention of the lifeguards is warranted. Two in particular (who were both working the two days we were there) were super friendly and engaged the kids in games of splashing and play. Everyone was friendly and smiled. We definitely enjoyed our two days here and would recommend legoland to other families without doubt.,4.0
3967,Rooms for improvement in this new theme park,"This is the second Legoland I visited, the overall impression of Legoland Malaysia is OK, I give a 'B' grade to it.  The location is a bit remote, can still see some on going building sites around it from the Lego Tower. The staff are friendly and helpful in Legoland Malaysia (both at the theme park and at the hotel)",4.0
3968,suitable fro kids up to adulthood,"Went with my 2 kids aged 3 and 8 years old to Legoland on 1st May (a public holiday) after staying  in Legoland on 30th April. Hence carpark was free and we wree allowed entry 30 mins earlier than the public to our great surprise. Buying the tickets online at least 7 days in advance entitled us to 20% discount. We were all very satisfied from the variety of rides, shades, food and the activites which are suited for both my girls. Were particularly happy that day as there were not much queues anywhere. We were able to take rides after rides, sometimes continuously without getting off the coasters. Lego bricks are liberally available everywhere, even while queuing and adults can rest in air conditioned places while the kids are occupied playing with them. Though the review I read before going there mentioned about lack of shade, I felt that it is not true. I thought that it is very thoughtful that there are playgrounds with shelter. As vibrant colours are everywhere, Legoland does make me feel happy just being part of it. We had pizza family combo, which are priced reasonably. Last but not least, the miniature sections are just so cute and amazing and it kept me wondering how this was achievable, with some moving vehicles and sound system which make the representative countries more real-like.My kids and I were definitely reluctant to leave.",5.0
3969,Great start to our Asian family holiday,"We visited Legoland theme park  on Tuesday 22nd and the waterpark on Wednesday 23rd of April. It was an amazing experience. We have 2 children, 5 and 7 and they had a blast. They were tall enough for the majority of the rides (some said you had to be 6 and 107cm but my daughter was tall enough so she went on).  There was hardly any line ups which meant we got a full day of rides. We stayed at the Legoland Hotel and was able to enter the theme park at 9.30am rather than 10am. We took advantage of this both days (and on the second day went to the water park from the theme park). Another advantage of staying at the hotel is getting discounted tickets. We purchased a combo deal 2D pass to both parks under a buy one day get one free offer when we booked the hotel. In the afternoon of both days it rained and many rides were closed ‚Äì but there is still plenty to do when it rains, including the shops, 4D movies, inside lego building areas, pharaohs revenge ride and the robot lab (need to be 8 ‚Äì but as my son was nearly 8 they let him in and you have to book in advance). It was definitely hot so hats, water and sunscreen is required. We found there to be enough shade however and most rides you lined up under shelter. At the theme park there was one ride where you get considerably wet ‚Äì we were wearing sneakers and socks and this was quite uncomfortable for the rest of the day. I suggest you take shoes that dry quickly like thongs. Clothes getting wet wasn‚Äôt a problem as you dry off quite quickly. We thought the food was reasonably priced compared to what we would pay in Australia ‚Äì more expensive than what you can get outside the park but the convenience of not having to leave was worth it for us. It was still cheap for us. The water park was small but still enough for us to spend the majority of the day there ‚Äì we went back to the theme park around 3pm when it rained and the slides closed. Some slides had long waits, mainly the ones with the tubes, so we went to the other ones when the lines were too long. You can hire a cabana for either a full or half a day which has drinks, towels, wifi, seats, shade etc for RM300 per full day. We didn‚Äôt bother as it seemed expensive and just left our bag in the bag/shoe racks when we went on the rides. We didn‚Äôt hire towels either ‚Äì just dried off in the sun.It was probably made more enjoyable for us as the kids loved it so much. They are asking to come back again (but from Australia it won‚Äôt be a regular activity). It was definitely a great family trip.",5.0
3970,weekday visit from singapore,"2 adults + 5 yo visited on a Monday. Great day - enough to keep us busy.Buying the combo pass on the website 7+ days before visit was best value option we could source (RM140 per adult, RM112 for 1-day entry to waterpark and Legoland). Was well priced compared to Singapore attractions.Lots of the attractions are aimed at younger (3 - 5yo) kids, but the waterpark and several of the rides in Legoland park itself are definitely aimed at 5+yo kids and adults. We felt it had something for everyone.A bit annoying that the air conditioning failed in a show and they ushered us out halfway through - which disappointed the 5 yo considerably.I'd seen some reviews on trip advisor that were very scathing, especially about a lack of shade/shelter. This was not our experience - the entire walkway from the bus area to the main gate (about 100m) was covered, and most rides had sheltered waiting areas.No real queues mid-week, which meant we were able to go on most rides several times, and didn't even need to get off between rides.The bus leaving from Singapore flyer was really convenient.",4.0
3971,My children love it.,"I went to Legoland at april 30th, it's weekday, so it's not so crowded and as we stayed at Legoland Hotel, we can enter the park at 09.30 a.m. This park is suitable for kids between 4-12 years old. My daughters which are 4 and 7 years old were very excited and had ""the best day ever"" that's what they told me. Most of the rides are for children age 6 years old and  above. There are few rides for the younger ones and there are also playground inside Legoland. A few tips that I can share: Please bring umbrella, hat, mini fan,  sunglasses and sunblock with you. Bring plenty of drinking water, bring food too. The food is really expensive inside Legoland (15-20 MYR). I bought the tickets from Legoland website and by purchasing it a week before, you can get 20% discount.  Get the map when you enter legoland so you know the rides in each area, save the indoor activities for midday when it's really hot so you can cool off there. Bring changing clothes, there are 2 rides that will make you wet.",4.0
3972,Go in a big group!,"I just visited Legoland Malaysia with a group of 9 of us over the weekend and it was so much fun! We bought a combo ticket that allowed us to visit both the Legoland themepark as well as the waterpark unlimited times during our 2 days there. We were very blessed to have gone during the StarWars weekend (May the Forth be with you) as well so we had a chance to take pictures with the StarWars characters and games. We also stayed in the Legoland hotel for convenience sake and it was definitely a good choice - themed rooms and good breakfast! Booked through WTS Travel for our transportation to and from Singapore. On an interesting note, we were all about 25 years old but we had such a blast! My main tip is to go in a big group. Its truly loads of fun with good company. If you would like to see the pictures we took during the trip, feel free to visit www.abbyinwander.wordpress.com. I really felt that Legoland Malaysia superseded my expectations and i'm really glad we took the weekend off to head over!Great break from our busy schedules at work.",5.0
3973,Keep selling annual pass with system error.,"On 4 May 2014, I came to legoland Malaysia.I bought 1 adult 1 day ticket and 2 children 1 day ticket.Because there is a promotion for children ticket for free upgrade to annual pass, I upgrade my ticket to annual pass too.There is a membership since date in annual card.It prints correctly for children card but not for adult card. It prints as many years back.When I ask why it happens, the staff told me there is an error in the system that can not print correctly to adult annual pass card for this promotion.The staff just told me, please use the children annual pass for reference of membership date validation.I just wonder, if this time legoland allowed this system error happened, what I can say if within 1 year, I come to legoland, not bring my children annual pass and the system said, my card had expired.I wrote this to legoland and waiting their real answer for this beside promise the system will always 100% correct or just simple the customer need bring their annual pass receipt as prove the date of purchase.Beside above unpleasant incident, my journey with my children to legoland to celebrate starwars day is very good as usual.",4.0
3974,Good for kids but not so much for the adults,"The theme park is mainly targeted family with young children but not so much for adults as most of the attractions are meant for young kids only. Still it is full of fun and adventure.I highly recommend anyone who wish to visit Legoland to bring sunblock/sunscreen, cap, and sunglasses as the weather can get very hot and mostly sunny.",4.0
3975,"Good for kids, not suitable for adults","LEGOLAND¬Æ Malaysia is more suitable for family trips, especially with young ones. That way you can really enjoy the theme park. To be honest, I find the tickets very pricey. I mean for the scale of the theme park, having to pay RM140 onwards (mind you, this is excluding water park), there are less than 20% RIDEABLE rides for adults (minus those under maintenance). I would rather top up a few more bucks for another theme park just over the border. Anyway, #justmyduapuluhsen.The only thing appealing to me is the Lego MINILAND.",3.0
3976,It's still full of fun!,"It's our second time to visit Legoland Malaysia. The water park is quite small but the kids still enjoyed it very much. We have the following recommendations. 1.	I think the best value deal is the two days combo Legoland + Water Park tickets. You‚Äôd need a full day to truly enjoy each park.2.	It‚Äôs always hot in this part of the world. Apart from the usual sunscreen and sun glasses and hat, I have also got a small water spray bottle to create our own cooling water mist. It worked well for my kids.3.	The food quality inside the park was really just so so. We like to go out to the Medini mall opposite the park to eat.",5.0
3977,Over rated,"This place need to be developed . The price is overly rated adults and RM95 for water park and RM75 for kids. It was really dissappointing as the service, opreration method is clearly copied from Singapore's universal studio. The only things is the standard is very low. I'm not sure if the managenment is the same (i don't think so) but i was hoping for better standard based on the marketing for legoland. ",2.0
3978,Nice but hot!,"We drove up from Singapore for a 2 day one night trip to legoland. The trip up was smooth and it was well sign posted from the 2nd link. We had purchased the annual pass online. However, even though the annual pass and legoland hotel residents were supposed to be allowed to enter the park 30 mins earlier and via a separate entrance, this was not the case.Our 6 year twins and 2 year old enjoyed the park very much. The park rides and entertainments were suitable and optimal for for ages 6-12. But it was hot. Very hot. The walkways and some of the rides were not sheltered. It is vital to go armed with sun gear such as lots of water, hats and sunglasses.Due to the change of workdays and weekends in JB. Saturday was a very busy day at the park but Sunday was great with little lines.All in all, we would visit again but not bother with trying to enter early.",4.0
3979,Kids demand to return!,"Legoland is pure joy for younger kids. Teenagers and adults will probably find it a little dull but the younger kids will be turned on by all the fun activities they can partake in. Another great benefit is that there are no lines for anything (we went on 3 consecutive weekdays). My kids (ages 9 and 10) pronounced definitively that Legoland was ""way better than Disneyland"". Food there was cheaper than Disneyland too.Another great feature is the Waterpark, which is fun for young and old alike. There are some exciting slides and a great water playground for the kids. I thought this was more enjoyable than the theme park itself and we spent almost a full day there. You have to pay extra for the Waterpark.The only bad thing about Legoland is the heat, which can really wear you down if you don't have a strategy to deal with it. Umbrellas, hats, sunscreen are a must. I would recommend alternating indoor and outdoor activities to get some respite or perhaps going to the Waterpark during the hottest part of the day and leaving the theme park until the evenings.The other bad thing is the taxi mafia. If you're taking a taxi back from Legoland to your hotel, the only taxis available there are the blue executive taxis, which charge about 3 times more than the normal red taxis. If you're taking a red taxi to Legoland I would suggest that you arrange for the taxi driver to pick you up at a set time so as to avoid the costly blue taxis.The kids are already demanding to return for the summer holidays. That's the highest endorsement I can give.",5.0
3980,Great for kids,"We were 2 adults and avid Lego lovers. The best part and the place where I spent the most time was where they had built famous attractions in Asia out of Lego bricks. Unfortunately, that was also the area that had the least shade.The rides were average, not really a worthwhile place to visit without kids. We took an 8:30am bus from Singapore and as there were hardly any people at the park we were ready to leave by about noon. Unfortunately, there were no buses until later in the afternoon. We had originally booked the last bus back thinking there would be more to do, but we took a chance and were waitlisted for an earlier bus which we thankfully were able to get on.",3.0
3981,Creativity at its best.,There are many marvels created with the help of Lego bricks. Miniland inside the park in itself is a marvel. Add to it the theme park and water park. Theme Park has lots of fun ride and Water Park is also fun for young children.,5.0
3982,Great for young kids,"We did a day trip from Singapore during our 2 week vacation.  We took up a number of suggestions from other reviews, namely: we went during the week and avoided the crowds; we went here before visiting some of the big attractions in Singapore (which are better) and we started on the right side of the park.  As others have said Customs is ordinary (read slow). Yes it is a hot and there isn't lot of shade, its the tropics!The staff were all very friendly and helpful.  Our kids 6 and 5 really enjoyed the cars (they get to drive themselves) and the mechanical horse rise (must have gone on 6 times).  Our 6 year old also liked the water slide ride.The exchange rate meant everything was rather cheap (should have bought more).  We had lunch in the pizza place, if I went back would probably go to the cafe near the castle (looked like better food).  The food was average but it was cooked right in front of you so it was hot and fresh and inexpensive.A few weeks on and the kids are still talking about it so they really enjoyed it.  Well worth a visit for a day if you have kids.",5.0
3983,For the Lego Lovers,"If you've always been a fan of Lego toys since you were a kid, then you will enjoy this theme park even if the rides are aimed for the kids. Also for the kids at heart. :) We loved the Mini Land!  Went there on a weekday and we had easy access to all the rides, no long queue!",4.0
3984,A Gem of a park!,"I took a side-trip from Kuala Lumpur just to visit LegoLand and I was very glad I did.The park is we maintained, neat and clean, I visited on a Tuesday and it was quiet with no queues or or crowds yet all the activities were happening as they would on a weekend.  The mix of rides and activities suits adults and children - well as a solo 39 year old traveller I suppose the phrase ""big kid"" has to be used.  The gardens features Lego whimseys such as rabbits and deer, so have a keen eye and a camera ready!",5.0
3985,Great Legoland,"We've travelled to LEGOLAND California previously and were keen to take the kids here as they are Lego crazy.  The park didn't disappoint, the team working at the park were brilliant - helpful and friendly.  We loved the Mini Land as it was Asia focussed.  Fortunately we went to Mini Land first as there was a monumental downpour afterward for about an hour and we found indoor attractions at the Park, but at least we'd had time to absorb the detail in the wonderful buildings.We arrived at 9.30 and left at 6pm.  A full on day and the kids loved every moment.  We loved the new Chima special 4D movie at the cinema - a real highlight.One of my sons took his first roller coaster ride at the park and we bought the picture as a memory for him.  He then went on the other rides and we couldn't keep him off them.  We found the food choices quite good and reasonably priced.  The best shopping for us will always be the Brick Shop.  We came home with two huge mixed bags of bricks to shore up the already massive collection of Lego we have.  We also bought some sets, polo shirts and other merchandise.  They do a special at the moment of spend over a certain amount and get a free annual children's pass - it's a shame you couldn't do it on several dockets as we spent enough over the course of the park twice, so we could have have two annual passes.  ",5.0
3986,Great entertainment for kids,"Legoland speaks for itself. Great entertainment for kids as is the new Waterworld facility as well so bring your kids swimming gear. If you intend visiting more than twice a year, it is worth buying an annual Premium Pass which pays for itself after three visits and is free for the rest of the year.",4.0
3987,Good for family,"Went on Good Friday. It was a public holiday in Singapore and also a long weekend. Reached at about 9.50am. The theme park opens at 10am. When I arrived, there was alre quite some people queuing.We went to join the queue. Before the theme park opens, there would be this group of staff dancing there before it opens. When we were allowed in, they requested to check our bags. Then there were mascots around taking pictures.Went around the theme park till 2 pm before we went to the waterpark. For the theme park. I think it is better for families with small children. Most of the rides are meant for families or kids. There are only 2-3 more adventurous rides. And quite a few rides only for children. Would advice on not bringing too much valuables. As they only provide racks to put the belongings and not lockers. Lockers are available but chargeable. The theme park would be a great place for taking photos. There is a miniland where there are different attractions of different countries all made of lego.",3.0
3988,"Great Fun for Kids, But enjoyment curtailed by weather situations","The 'Dry' Theme park has attractions specially for the kids below the age of 13. There are lot of rides and activities keeping them in mind. For adults there are very few things of attractions but this not a thing of concern for families with kids such as us. We went during off peak season so we pretty much had the place for us - It was easy to get into the rides without much queuing. The Driving School was my daughter's first attempt at driving solo and she liked it very much. We enjoyed the boating, lego train, beetle bounce, Duplo express and Merlin's Challenge. Some of the rides are so-so. The main problem is lack of tree cover and covered places at the park and the heat is unbearable. Use sunscreen or umbrella if you get affected by the sun easily. Also when it rains, it seems that the park closes all the outdoor rides for the rest of day. For us, unfortunately, it rained around 3pm to 4pm, after this, all the rides stopped even though there was no more rain. So we could cover only half the park due to this reason. May go again sometime later to cover the rest. The 'Wet' theme park is good, but does not have any unique attractions.  Most of the rides/features there are also available elsewhere in Malaysia and Singapore. So I recommend you to go only if you have extra time to spend.The parks provide lockers to keep your luggage but to us seem bit overpriced but there are no other option if you want to move about lighter. The food within the resorts is good and reasonably priced for an amusement park. We did not try out much and stuck to the food preferred by kids (Pizza and ice creams). The cleanliness was good and the service quality patchy. We encountered both polite and rude staff throughout the park. The Lego branded items are costly hence we did not pay any attention to the Lego shops. One would expect that these things reasonably priced or discounted for visitors there since one takes the trouble to travel all the way to Legoland and then pay a high entrance ticket price. ",3.0
3989,Is this a real theme park?,"Maybe I was expecting too much but this place is seriously lacking the ""fun"" element. Staff are just too bored and making no efforts whatsoever to ensuring visitors get the fun-filled atmosphere. For the money spent on the entrance fee, this place also lacks attractions and activities. The rides were pretty boring and wonder how it can competes and stay in business for a long time... Unless future attractions/activities are being planned.Food was so so and the retail shops pricing was crazily overpriced! Maybe cheap if you earn SGD or USD... Oh yes, hope they fix the car park soon. Some directional signboards will definitely helpful when looking for our car....",2.0
3990,Not bad but not that great as well... Ok...,"The location is remote, quite far from the happening places. Needs a bus, taxi or a private car to reach the destination. The shops are very limited. Park is just plain and nothing special except of course the Lego concept. Limited rides so if the park is full expect a long queue for your turn. When it rains, not much covered area to run to and cover.when it's sunny, not much trees or shaded parts as well. Overall, it was fun and okay.",3.0
3991,Great for kids aged 3 to 12,"We have annual passes since we live locally. Our four kids always enjoy going and even our eldest (aged 13) has a good time: I would say that she probably has another year or two before she would view it as dull. The rides at Legoland are not extreme but are enough fun that the kids want to go round a few times. And there is plenty of other stuff to do - make sure that you have a look around and check out things like the robots. If you are going for more than one day then I'd also go to the waterpark: you could do both in a day (in fact it's a really nice way to cool off) but unless you'd been to the park before then you'll have enough to amuse the family at Legoland itself for a day. The hotel is great - some friends stayed and we had a look around the rooms - all really well done and they loved it. Food inside the park is only so so - don't get your hopes up - but not overly expensive. If you are coming from Singapore do try and pick a weekday - weekends are so much more crowded. And crossing the border you will want to avoid peak times...the park opens at 10 and closes at 6 or 7pm...I'd plan to leave Singapore at 9 and probably to stay and eat after the park so that you avoid the rush hour. If you don't have a car that can cross the border then you should be able to arrange transport for S$150 round trip in a private car. Otherwise you will have to join a bus trip, which your hotel can sort out. The waterpark has lockers for storage of your valuables for a fee (MYR20?).",4.0
3992,Booked for 5 days. Left after 3.,We arrived at legoland ready for 5 days of lego fun. After booking into the hotel where they tried to charge us for a already pre paid holiday. Room was awesome (the only good part). We went to both parks. As we were sitting in the lobby (the only entertainment and wifi point) we decided to go from 5 days to 3. Alcohol was a joke and I wasn't offered any (I'm female). Staff were rude and hotel was boring.,2.0
3993,I'm Back Again :),"Booked tickets online - there is a discount for purchasing tickets 7 days in advance through their website. How we got there: we arranged a taxi from the hotel in Singapore to cross border taxi service office in Singapore. From there we got another taxi from Singapore directly to Johor, Malaysia. These aren't normal taxis, the only taxis that go to Malaysia are 'cross border' taxis. We only needed to change taxis once which was extremely safer and more convenient. The cost of the first taxi depends where your hotel is located from the cross border taxi service. Our taxi was S$15 and we only paid S$70 for the taxi from border of Singapore to Johor. This price works out great if you have multiple luggage and 2 or more people traveling. Taxi works out cheaper than the coach/bus service and no chance that your connecting coach will leave without you in Malaysia.Once we got there: It was amazing! It was everything I expected and more, I loved every part of the attraction. Remember to bring sunscreen and a hat, it can get very hot walking around. There isn't any currency exchange places near Legoland, but the attraction takes Singapore dollar and will give you change in Malaysian Ringgit which is very handy.All staff at Legoland are friendly and every ride you go to there is a professional photographer that will take your photo on your camera and on their cameras. You will get a card from the first photographer and once you get to the next photographer they will take your photo and then scan your card. At the end of the day you can give the card to the photolab and see all your photos taken during the day - VERY SMART! The best part of Legoland is miniland. These are iconic cities built form lego. It is amazing detail and absolutely wonderful.If you can arrange it, visit Legoland during the beginning of the week as there will be next to no line ups for rides and services.",5.0
3994,Hot sunny day.,The rides was okay but there are not so many trees and it was soooooo hot on sunny days that it made you feel uncomfortable. Staff was ok and the place is clean. For me the park was quite small but it is satisfactory. ,3.0
3995,Day Visit to Legoland,"We took two very active grandsons aged 7&9.They enjoyed it. They would have liked to have had more rides but rain prevented this.Our impression was to have the full benefit, it would necessary to stay at least overnight. The food outlets and shops were excellent value.The bus trip from Singapore is tedious with the necessary two disembarkations in both directions taking up a total of three and a half hours. This in addition to the lengthy pre-travel requirements when purchasing the bus tickets in Singapore.The park area itself is woefully short of shelter from sun and rain. Ponchos and umbrellas are essential. Tree planting is minimal and the trees there are of vertical shape rather than of the spreading variety and will not ever provide adequate shelter.There is quite a walk from the drop off point to the entrance which could be alleviated with a fun type shuttle tram or similar. A long walk after the visit is the last thing adults and children need after an exhausting time.There is inadequate shelter at the pickup/ dropoff area and drainage problems at the end of the long walkway meant either removing one's shoes or going home with wet feet.  Compared with other attractions in Singapore, it fared very badly.  A tour operator familiar with LEGOLAND, stated there was belief that the park was not doing as well as was hoped, and may in fact close down.  This would not surprise us.  We would imagine other Legolands would be far superior to this underdone attraction, which has some delightful constructions, marred by the inability to enjoy them to the full.",2.0
3996,Too hot but Okay. Staff to be more attentive.,"Overall physical experience was excellent. There's plenty of souvenir shops and drinks counter available along the way. I am just a single traveller, it would be nice if the staff are able to approach the visitor who seems puzzled and wondering around waiting for some information instead of gathering among themselves laughing and chatting loudly. Plenty of times wasted under the shades as it is too hot there. Would probably bring an umbrella next time. Facilities are all 5 Stars.Last but not least, staff to be a little bit more attentive as i could also see some of the families seems to be waiting/reading informations about a certain games at the entrance while most of the staff just chit-chatting and dont even bother to approach the visitors. Thanks",4.0
3997,Pleasant surprise,"Our kids are 14 & 12 years old and reading the reviews on tripadvisor didn't expect much as they were older.  We ended up having a good time. Few tips - for older children purchase both tickets - leogland & waterpark. Weather - as they close the rides when it rains, check the weather report before you go.  It had been raining in the afternoons so we did all the outside rides in the morning leaving the 4D show's & inside activities when the rains came. Food -  read food expensive so took our own food (sandwiches, snacks, etc). Heat - heaps of suncream and hats. As it was a weekday it wasnt that crowded so we were able to do legoland in about 3 1/2 hours, then went to the waterpark. Came back to legoland when the storm came (the waterpark closed down) then spent the rest of the afternoon at waterpark when opened again.. Parks were open from 10am - 6pm.  We spent the whole time there going on rides several times.",4.0

4002,Good for under-12,"The park is more for kids under-12.My 11 year-old was real fascinated and excited.The older ones found all the rides too tame for them.Park is small and can be done in a day.We went on  a Saturday and crowd was bearable although the 4-D cinemas got rather crowded in the afternoon.The  Miniland is the best part of the park.The park is real hot especially the Waterpark .They don't even have fans to cool us down,like some parks that I have been too.The main park is not too bad.We can go into the aircon shops/cafes  to cool down when the heat gets unbearable.Bring lots of water.Food is quite costly and not that good quality-wise.",3.0
4003,Legoland for kids,"We were expecting so much of this amusement park, the likes of Disneyland and Universal Studios...But kinda disappointed because an adult like me who's fond of rides or shows in amusement will also want to enjoy amusement park as much as every kid does.There are only 3 rides we can take at Legoland. That's all because most of the rides are just for small kids. My daughter who is a tall kid did not also had fun because she can't ride other rides since she's tall.We got in at 10AM and left 1:30 PM because we got bored and there's nothing more to see or do because with that time frame, we saw and did everything already in a very warm summer day.",3.0
4004,My Kind of Theme Park,"You may check my travel blog about LEGOLAND: http://franchichi.weebly.com/3/post/2014/04/kl-key-to-legoland.htmlThe rides may not be as exciting as Universal Studios Singapore nor as magical as Hong Kong Disneyland but LEGOLAND is just a haven for a LEGO fan like me; a number of discounted LEGO sets, the per gram brick, the LEGOlized items and tourist spots, the funny-yet-exciting participative rides, everything is awesome! I just hope that the food in a way is also LEGOlized, like when you buy drinks and the ice cubes are LEGO shaped, the soup is in a brick bowl, fries cut like an 8x1 lego brick, or the pizza is somehow LEGO inspired. That would be more awesome.The rain poured in the afternoon, perhaps a usual scenario in the park as most of the stalls sells raincoats and umbrellas. It would be great if they add more covered walkways for the park to be more accessible during rainy days.",5.0
4005,Good waterpark and hotel.... Disappointing park,Had a good and very worth it stay at the water park and hotel but bad experience at the park.First we purchased tickets for the water park and park online with the hotel. at the gate entrance of the park when we gave our tickets only 2 tickets were given back to us when we purchased 3( 2adults and one child) thus when we entered the water park we were held back not to enter because we were lacking one ticket for our son. Good thing when the officer at the entrance of the water park knew where we purchased it he checked back the records in the hotel and we were right so he allowed us to enter the water park. Lesson dont trust their people at the entrance. Count the tickets they give you back when entering. As we read in some reviews sometimes there are discounted tickets near the entrance of the park. Some staff of the park may have plans of re selling your tickets if you dont give notice to it. My experience was i was so excited to see the happiness of my child that i forgot to give importance to redeem my tickets at the entrance and we had trouble entering the water park. Hope this review could give awareness to you guys.Then the next day as we were about to leave legoland our son wanted to watch the remaining movies at the 4d theatre that we missed the day before( they had 4different movies we only saw one) but the theatre was under service so we missed the 3 remaining movie. In fairness to legoland we felt that their 4d theatre was way better than the Shrek movie house in USS thats why we would have wanted to complete all the movies they were showing. Disappointing way to end our legoland trip but we will be back.Best to go with kids aged 5-12 . Above 12 yrs old they will enjoy water park not the theme park.,3.0
4006,Great for little kids,"We spent 1 day at the park and 1 day at waterpark. We had 2 fun days. Park is quite small and as there were no queues we were able to do everything by lunchtime. Head down early, gets busier later and towards weekend.",4.0
4007,"Totally, disappointed!","We visited this park last Sunday (20 April, 2014) with 3 of my ""adult"" friends. By reading all the good reviews here, we decided to finally go to Legoland!. First ride we tried was the 4D Ride - Chima as it was raining heavily. Warning: Put your cameras in your bags when you watch this 4D. The only effects that they have was: 1) air blowing towards the audience, 2) smoke - red and green only and 3) water with sticky soap! Literally, they make the audience really wet until we are already shouting to stop because we are so wet! Don't expect your chair to move and the quality of the picture (3D) is not so good as well.We decided to try other rides and we've noticed that majority of the rides were meant for kids only. Actually, they should advertised this for kids only. It's like a circus fair with lego characters. Sad to say but it is a poorly built themepark.My verdict:Money is not well spent in Legoland Malaysia (Day Pass) and I think it's the same with their Water Themepark - better go Adventure Water Cove in Singapore. Eventhough we got it for a promotion at Groupon for only $60.38 - Lego Day Pass + 2way ticket from SG to Legoland MY (advertised as $59.90 but Groupon charged more on their advertised price). it doesn't breakeven the cost of the rides and attractions of this theme park. They just only build the themepark not so long ago but it's looks run down already and there were no shows at all! Totally, disappointed! Will not come back ever again!",1.0
4008,Enjoy,"A good place to spend your weekend with your family or friends. They queue is long in the morning, but disappear during the noon towards the evening. So my suggestion is, have your picture taken around the park in the morning, have a very good lunch and enjoy the ride afterwards. The queue is barely there!As for waterpark, we had so much fun within the small range area. But the slides are all good and enjoyable! Might be coming back for that!Wear something light (tshirts, jeans, or sweatpants) and slippers or flipflop will do! No need to wear fancy clothes as it is super hot in there!! Don't forget to bring along sunblock with good spf!",4.0
4009,Great Theme Park for the kids,"I had brought my family to various theme parks either within Malaysia or those in Gold Coast, Australia and Universal Studio Singapore. While I enjoyed Gold Coast themeparks (Movie World and Dream World) tremendously but for my children (and my wife), it is Legoland that they think is the best. We went there at the tailend of the school holidays (Singapore's school holidays ended a week before) and was surprised to find that most rides either had short lines or no lines at all. Probably the first to my experience but then it was also during the hot weather season. Rides mostly cater for the early teens and below and those who do not enjoy those heart bursting thrill rides that you normally find at other theme parks. As such, this is really the most ideal theme parks for family with young children. The older teens and young adult might find this place boring.We didn't intend to go to the water park and had only bought tickets for the main theme park. But we had some views of the water park, found it to be a very fun place for the whole family by the looks of it.",4.0
4010,A heaven's place for lego lovers,"Was there apr 6,2014 - from Singapore we crossed Johor bahru n went to this place. kids really enjoyed a lot at Theme park. Rides according to them were super fun and amazing! ( just talking about the roller coaster perhaps) the sights were thoroughly thought and presented brilliantly especially the Asia miniland park.Waterpark is definitely a must to visit as well. The park opens at 10 am and closes at 6:30pm.",4.0
4011,small and for kids only,the park is very small. All of the games are only for kids. You don't have to visit this park if you are not parents taking kids to there. You don't have to wait for most of the games. I think the park is not attractive with few visitors. The water park is ok but also a little bit small. ,1.0
4012,"Good rooms, well-equipped though small, but buffet was terrible","the buffet dinner at Bricks restaurant was TERRIBLE, not normal terrible but i-cannot-believe-its-so-bad terrible. not even considering the amount paid, the absolute standard is so deplorable that that the best dish was fried rice. not to mention the breakfast at the same restaurant, which is equally bad.but other than that, rooms are well-equipped though small. but being conveniently located meant that there's a x-factor for a short 2-day park+hotel vacation.",3.0
4013,Small but nice,"We took the kids there on a Saturday. The park itself is actually quite small but there are enough rides to entertain the kids. On our visit, short ques made it possible for us to play almost all the rides in one day which is great. What it lacked was shading from the sun, which in the summer could get very very hot.",4.0
4014,Paradise for kids! Here some tips from our experience :),"Family of 5 (kids 5,2,10 mth) visit during Easter holiday. travelled from JB Senai airport. Stayed at Nusa CT hotel (25 min from airport by taxi about 57-80RM) one way. Our hotel was 10min away from Legoland/ hotel kitty/ little big club (23RM one way blue taxi). We heard that red taxi is a bit cheaper. Savings on Legoland can be made by purchasing tickets online or local taxi drivers will approach you with an offer of buying on their behalf as the locals have a special cheaper rate! If you are planning to visit  H Kitty and a little Big club, KEEP!!! your Legoland tickets and receive 10% discount, when you purchasing at the park, but here again, locals pay only85 and tourist will pay 110 per person (from 3 years old age). Cost of Lego merchandise is much lower than in Europe! I have compared the price of identical Lego sets, paid 340RM in the park while Amazon UK would charge 105¬£! Happy time for my monsters and my credit card! :) A little warning. If you are planning to bring your snacks and drinks -not permitted, your bags can be searched! :D Quality of food is very low! You must be prepared to the super deep fried chicken, prawns, fries, onion rings and burgers! Meal deal is about 22RM, includes cremated chicken, fries, sugary drink and even a Papaya fruit portion! :) There is an option of exiting the park, you get the stamp on your arm for the return, and eat just outside in various restaurants. Having very young kids we have booked a private cabana (at waterpark) . For 300 RN you get a safe, fan, 2 beds, 2 chars, 2 WIFI access for a day, 2 free Legoland towels and about 6 drinks with a fridge to keep it cool. We have really enjoyed it BUT it felt a bit ""Budget"" without quiet areas with pretty palm trees, umbrellas and sunbeds. (Sorry I been spoiled with Cuprus' waterparks).During the rain all the rides will be closed (dry theme park) But rains usually aren't too long, but can't really be forecasted. My kids thoroughly enjoyed themselves at the both parks, I liked the water park more :)",5.0
4015,Knockoff version of Disneyland with a touch of Lego in a 3rd world,"Visited on April 16, 2014 with my 5 and 2 year old. Not a public holiday so there were no lineup whatsoever and probably the only good thing about the park. Can't imagine if i need to lineup for 30mins+ for those average rides.It is hot with no shades, the trees probably need another 10 years to grow before they can offer any help.The rides are boring for the 5 year olds and at the same time, scary for the 2 years old. The rides can be put into basically any theme parks and the only thing lego about those rides are maybe the logo on them? Bathrooms are hot with no AC and dirty, despite the fact that the park wasn't even packed on the day. There aren't any bathrooms inside the restaurant, somehow.. You will have to go out for the bathroom which is only a few of them inside the whole park, and with no signage of where they are located.Eating at the park is a painful experience, most of them time we are trying to fight off the flies as they are everywhere, even though we are indoor. Food is nothing to write home about but what do you expect in at a theme park. The good thing is they are not overpriced (at a themepark standard)",3.0
4016,A terrific family park,"We travelled from Singapore on an organised tour. We had a combo ticket, allowing access to the wet park and dry park. It really was a terrific day and well worth the money we paid. Hiring a cabana at the wet park allowed us a meeting point for the day, shade when we needed it, secure safe storage for our passports (required when travelling from Singapore), cold drinks, souvenir towels and lunch bought to the cabana when requested. We will visit again but next time we will stay at the Legoland Hotel and have two days at the parks. ",5.0
4017,Fun,"We visited on a Monday and Tuesday in April - we had a great time particularly as we didn't have to wait in any queues.  The weather was hot and sunny - sun hats and sun cream were essential.  We wore sandals and crocs - there were no rides where your feet are dangling in the air.  Our children were five, seven and eight at the time of the visit - this attraction was perfect for these ages.",4.0
4018,My daughter enjoyed it!,"Our yearly vacation this time was a combination of a trip to Singapore and a quick day trip to JB to check out Legoland. Although it is relatively new, it was already very popular amongst Filipino travelers. In fact, while at the park, it felt like we were back home with lots of Pinoys, just like us, enjoying the facilities.",4.0
4019,Great way to spend a day in JB.,"The entrance would just make you want to dash inside. The ticket queue was long but it only took a short while to get the tickets. Ticket staff well trained and courteous in serving customers. The same goes for all staff operating the theme park. Always with a smile even if the weather is really hot on that day. My family enjoyed the place just like most other theme parks we've been to but it was the customer service at Legoland that we give credit. Food there is expensive as with most tourist attraction but when you are hungry and thirsty, what choice do you have? People complained about the lack of shelters but I think they are just nitpicking people from down south who are used to air conditioning and complain just about everything under the sun. We did not have problem finding shelters near attractions and when the weather gets too hot, the air con food court is a welcome relieve. Weather in Malaysia is unpredictable, so it is best advised to wear loose clothings and sandals. Bring along an umbrella and raincoats  for the kids as it may be hot in the morning and downpour in the afternoon. As for the rides, especially the popular ones, wait until late afternoon where there will be less queue instead of lining up for an hour and wasting time that can be better used visiting other attractions.",4.0

4022,Is worth to visit when you have kids aged between 6-11 & Mini land is a must see item.,"Park opens at 10am. Ticketing office starts at 9.45am. Buying tickets is easy and the staff are friendly. There are 1day/park ticket to choose or you can take the combo tickets to cover both parks in 1 day.WARNING! it will be very tiring for mummies with young kids as they will be running and running from park to park. Parking lots are ample but quite a walk and far from the theme parks. Fee for parking: 7 ringgit for whole day.At 80% rides are outdoor and 20% are sheltered rides. Queue is fast moving most of the time. So rides will continue rain or shine but will stop if there's a heavy downpour.LACK of shelters and shades at certain area.

4024,great for younger kids!,"I took my 7 year old, 4 year old, and 2 year old to this theme park. We went on a Thursday and there was no line at the ticket booth, which made me glad because I hadn't bought the tickets online like most of my friends said I should to save me the hassle of lining up. The lines to the rides were also nonexistent, we basically breezed through all the rides, and that was super because younger kids are not so patient. We went to pizza mania for lunch, the food was just average and there weren't many kinds of pizzas to choose from. Weather in Malaysia is sunny, so make sure you let your kids wear those cute bucket hats. We were done by 3 p.m., although there were probably about 5-7 attractions that we didn't get to ride, that's because kids were already in a hurry to get to the Legoland waterpark to cool down (I had only purchased the 1 day waterpark / theme park combo).The park is quite small, but just right for my kids. If you have kids older than 12 years old they might not find this place as exciting. Oh and we had only seen one mascot in the park - a Lego City Policewoman - I wish there was more of them!",4.0
4025,NICE PLACE TO ENJOY...,"We were in legoland for a day on the 17th of March. It was an enjoyable day at the park .... but the park is too huge to be covered in a day, especially if u also intend going for the water park which is just adjacent to the theme park. Kids would thoroughly enjoy it. Please do not carry any edibles / water etc as they do not allow them inside and you will have to keep it in the locker. Like i said it is not possible to cover both - theme and water park in a day. So if ur spending only 1 day try and be there early. Lockers are available at the entrance of the theme park as well as the water park and can be hired for a fee. Kids will definitely enjoy both and hence i recommend going to both.  There is a lego hotel at the entrance of the park so you can be near or you may stay at Parriss hotel which is about 7 kms away.",4.0
4026,Lack of toddler activities,"i went there with my 3yo daughter and not much she can do there, except the train which is so so the toddler driving school is quite good and the ball launcher. Other than that we're just wandering around in a very hot sunny day and we couldn't even enjoy taking photos and there's not enough bench anywhere to sit down or have a little rest, except in the restaurants. This place is much more fun for kids above 6 years old. The lego replica of cities in asia was awesome, there's even the sound and the boats and cars are moving as if it was a real city.",3.0
4027,Legendary ,"I was a bit apprehensive about going but my 10 year old son and 7 year old daughter were so excited. It turned out to be brilliant. Rides for my daughter to revel in and things for my son to build. Build your own figures in a pack of 3 for the same price as 1 in Singapore. Heaven or as my son put it after the first day "" best day ever Dad"". We went on a Sunday and Monday and that meant no lines and no waiting. I am sure this love gets really busy and it would be annoying to wait. All in all a great place and the only thing that let it down was the average park food. On the 2nd day we went out and got good elsewhere. We would definitely do this again.",4.0

4033,A Bit Boring,"The rides were not plentiful nor exciting for kids above eight years old.  There were too tame. Unless this theme park upgrades itself with more rides, it will not be able to pack the crowd in.  My two kids aged seven and eight were a bit bored going through the rides.",3.0

The Pirate Ship waterpark was a lot of fun & the staff joined in the fun by targeting the Dads & getting into water fun fights. tip: get a locker so you don't have to carry everything around park. Can exit park to grab a bite to eat. Bring loads of water to drink.",4.0
4036,Just like common playland,There were not many trees and shelters. It was very hot when we visited.

The pizza resto near baby care has sugarcane drink and coconut water.. taste good. But kids prefer to go back to USS rather than Legoland.,3.0
4037,Great for Young Lego Fans,"Since my children are big fans, they absolutely love this place, both the theme and water park. I can understand the cries for cooler solution for the park since i am an adult and no fans of lego, for they burn wallets faster than planes burn jet fuels. However, since the place is not crowded at all, in fact our average waiting time was 10 minutes, i dont really feel the heat was overbearing since we were more often inside or playing anyway. The food in the park was certainly better than US Disneyland and cheaper than Tokyo Disney Parks. The rides were mostly for kids but that was just perfect for mine, age 7 and 8. Of course going with our friends there made the whole trip even more enjoyable, untill the time to shop comes, which were inevitable. Once you are done at around 7 - 8 PM, there is a small mall next to the park to relax and grab yourself a Burger King or KFC, sushi, or chicken rice. If you really love Lego and can afford 250-300 USD price tag for Legoland Hotel, you can resume the Lego Madness there.",5.0

Good if there can be some fireworks in evening to close off the day in a memorable way.  We will be back again.",4.0
4039,Good to see legoland Malaysia,"But needs a lot more attractions than what is currently offered.  If I were to compare USS versus Legoland, I would say USS beats Legoland hands down.  But all the same, it was a pleasant trip to LegoLand Malaysia.",4.0

A child's set meal is about 15myr while adult set meal is 20-25.We also did the waterpark. It's worth it to get access to both parks. We got a 2 day park access for both so when it got hot, we moved to the waterpark till 6 the  went back in the legopark and stayed till 8. You can only have one reentry per day per park.

4050,~Few tips for future travelers to LegoLand~,"We took our 6 years old son to LegoLand, as a surprise for him. It was his dream holiday destination. The place is really fun for the kids. All the rides and other activities are really enjoying for the kids. Since we are not from JB, we managed to stay at a Budget Hotel at Bukit Indah. Just wanted to say a few tips for future travelers. (1) Please bring enough drinking water, cap and sunglass as the place is extremely hot! (2) The food is VERY expensive compare to Malaysian prices. (3) If you need a souvenir (from the shop) or just a photo (from their kiosks), it will again kill your pocket. Don‚Äôt even think of getting those, as the prices are way too high. (4) Toilets / showers at the changing room area (just after Wet Park) need proper maintenance. (5) They will provide locker facilities. But the prices are unreachable. Everyone will carry their valuables, but at their own risk. Most of them does not use the lockers as they are too expensive. (6) If you are travelling by taxi to LegoLand, please book a taxi to return back to your hotel or apartment. Outside LegoLand it‚Äôs only Blue Taxi (which they call themselves as Executive Taxi). The meter of those will jump in tens in seconds. So better book a Red Taxi (Budget Taxi) in advance for you to go back. You will NOT get a Red Taxi on the road. Please keep these few tips in mind, before you plan your trip to LegoLand.",4.0
4051,Fun day for family with kids,"We went on a Sunday, and was very surprised to see how few people were there. We arrived at 3pm thinking that we would only be able to do 3-4 rides as the park closed at 7pm, but surprisingly we did almost everything we wanted (12-13 rides/movie), and had half an hour to shop before the closing time. I later found out it might have been due to a few states in Malaysia had recently started to get kids to go to school on Sundays (so they have Fridays off instead). So it worked out really well for us. We also managed to get the Lady Dutch milk promotion, which was one child can go free if there's one paying adult. For 2 adults and 2 kids, we paid less than $110USD, which was really good value. We didn't see that many food places (weren't looking for them), but water/juice etc was very reasonable there. The park itself is very well laid out and has good rides throughout. The two that my son raved about was driving an electric car and boat. The kids also loved posing for photos with all the dressed up Lego figures.If you are coming from Singapore, as we were, it would really pay to go on the Singapore Flyer, a charter bus. It was a nightmare trying to get on a normal bus between the JB custom and Singapore custom. We specifically delayed our crossing till 9pm, and while both of the customs were efficient, trying to get from one to the other (around 3-4km) was an absolute nightmare. We joined the queue with about 10,000 people at 10pm for a normal bus. The people that had tickets for the charter bus just went on the bus quickly and disappeared. Next time we would either get the Singapore flyer or try to hire a car for one day to go to Legoland.",5.0
4052,Fun fun fun,My daughter had the 'bestest' time at both the theme park and water park.. Were lucky that there was moderate crowd and queues were not long. Park was clean though F&B is a bit on the pricy side. Travellers requiring taxis may find it a little bit expensive as there were only 'blue' taxis available when return from legoland. Costed us about rm40 to KSL...but red taxis were only about rm15 from tune hotel to legoland..,5.0
4053,"Nice rides, great experience and excellent service","For the school vacations, we decided to visit LegoLand in Johor.Since it was school vacation time, we were dreading the crowds and the March heat.We were pleasantly surprised on both counts. The weather turned out to be fairly overcast and the park was fairly empty which allowed us to take rides multiple times without queuing up.We started out with Mini land where we saw some wonderful examples built with Lego. We were particularly taken by the level of detail in most of the monuments. The Singapore tableau has people in the boats, the Taj Mahal also features a moving 'film shoot' taking place in the gardens complete with music etc.Lego City with the electric cars and the Boat school with electric boats that can be driven are a joy. The cars are only meant for little guests.Land of adventure had a very simple 'shoot them while you drive through' (Lost Kingdom) ride but it was immensely enjoyable.The airboat ride at Lego Technic is a lot of fun as well and so is the 'Twister'.The observation tower in Imagination is a short but nice view of the entire park. The Kids Power Tower is a fun ride that depends on how well you pull the rope to go higher up.The Royal Joust and Merlin's challenge are just the right rides for kids up to 8. Not too scary and enjoyable.There is a 4D adventure as well but to be honest, I found the one in Universal Studios Singapore to be more involving.There's also a small train that traverses some parts of the park.The park is also interesting for the several surprising Lego displays. Don't miss the sleeping man on the bench who snores or the people arguing about an accident or the lady feeding birds.The only quibble I would have is that the food options are very limited.The restroom facilities were sparkling clean.One final point I would like to highlight is that the service levels in the park are absolutely superb. Every park employee is always happy to help. We got caught in a downpour and some of the performers led us to a shady area and performed for us out there.In all, a wonderful experience that I'd repeat.",5.0
4054,Under expectation,"I went there with my mom, sister and cousin, we found it not as great as expected. We all agreed that it is more suitable for children than adults. Most of the districts there are for kids and teenagers and we only have fun in taking photos of different world famous attractions made by lego. The traffic is not well organized, it take quite a lot of time to go there from the airport.",3.0
4055,Good Fun for the Kids,"Decided to bring the family a day of fun at LEGOLAND. Overall it was a fun trip as my little girl had a great time. Only the food & beverage & also the souvenir shops in the park is a little expensive. Just a word of advise, please bring along a cap/sunglasses as its so hot !!",4.0
4056,Great place to make your kids happy,"Beautiful place. Depending on the day's crowd, sheltered areas may be limited when the sun is glaring and everyone's finding a place to hide. I went on a school holiday weekday. Queues were not long. The longest waiting period for a ride was 15minutes. The shortest was a walk-through. Some rides require kids to be of a certain age AND height. Most rides require a minimum age of 4. The lack of shelters can be overcome with umbrellas, hats and sunblock.",4.0
4057,Nice place,"We went to Legoland Malaysia last week, but it was raining heavily. We cannot enjoy it so much, but overall my children love it. In my opinion, beside the ride, they do not have much to see. All the stuffs are overprice, the ticket also pretty expensive if compare with Universal Studio. I would rather go back to Universal Studio if i have another option.",3.0

4060,Fantastic place for a Lego fan!,Visited this place twice and it never fails to mesmerized me especially the miniland. Staffs are helpful and friendly too!Worth the visit over and over again! ,5.0
4061,A must for kids aged 5 - 8,"Although visitors of all ages will enjoy Legoland, it's primarily aimed at the 5-8 years old age group.  Our son (5) and his cousin (6) absolutely loved Legoland and didn't want to go home, even though we had been there from 10.00 'til 19.00. The Legoland Driving school is must for boys or girls.Many people have written reviews saying it's expensive, I'd have to disagree.  In March 2014, the restaurants were offering family meal deals for 4 people (2 adults, 2 kids) for 48MYR and it was very good.We've visited Universal Studio in Singapore and DisneyLand HK, and LegoLand is right up there in terms of fun and enjoyment even though it lacks well-known characters.",4.0
4062,"Many said don't go, but we went and its thumbs up for us!","We asked around since many have been to Legoland before us. The reviews were hardly positive. But we took the plunge and wanted to go once to see for ourselves and let the boys (7 and 12) experience it before they grew up.The biggest factor of our positive experience was really ""no queues"". We went on Friday 20 March 2014 and did not have any queues apart from between 2pm and 5pm. So the recommendation is to go on a weekday, not school holidays, and not weekends. Make sure you go early so that you can start at 10am. Closes at 8pm but from about 6pm to 8pm there are dwindling crowds, but all the rides/kiosks are still open.Prices are not cheap, a family of 4 costs nearly SG$200. But without queues we were able to experience nearly 80% of all ""dry"" theme park attractions/rides. We also spent about 2 hours at Imagination (Build and Test) and 2 hours at Academy (robotics lab and lego building competition). So if we cut down the time spent here we could have finished looking at everything. We didn't buy the ""water"" park ticket. So in terms of value for money, it really wasn't bad since we got to experience nearly everything.But as with all things Malaysia, I hope that there is a budget for maintenance.And I would say that an interest in robotics or lego would help (for the academy). It can keep the older kids occupied. There are the usual roller coaster rides, spinning things, etc. So your kids need to come with the mindset there is no wifi and they'll need to have FUN! Coming with that mentality would help keep the interest and excitement.Bottom line, a thumbs up for Legoland, but you gotta come with the right attitude, and choose the right day.",4.0
4063,"""The best holiday ever,"" according to the kids!","My kids are almost 6 and almost 8 and LOVED this park. My son is Ninjago mad so he was a big reason we went to Legoland. I found that this park and the water park next door was perfect for both my kids. There were plenty of rides that weren't too scary for the younger kids but still a thrill and lots of cool lego characters etc. to look at. Lego mini land was pretty amazing too.The water park was not huge but I thought it was just right for a half day visit, we stayed even longer as the kids didn't want to leave. Again, it was perfect for this age group, not too much of a challenge and quite a few family rides.We visited in March which is the rainy season so the park was pretty quiet. As it only tends to rain late afternoon it wasn't much of a problem. It was much cooler than visiting later in the year! I'd rather get a little wet than roast...It wouldn't be in the same league as Disney Land or something like that, but we loved it.",4.0
4064,Great Idea yet much to be desired,"As part of our SG vacation, we decided to go legoland in Malaysia on our 3rd day, we left SG early in the morning and we came back early evening. The theme park is a great idea, yet so much is needed to realize it real potential as an all around tourist destination. With the present condition and for all it offers, a half day tour is enough. I suggest they put more trees and covered areas for the park gets too warm specially noon onwards, food is ok, very typical theme park fare. But I would commend thier staff, very courteous, very friendly and very nice. I just hope that in years to come as they expand, may the theme park add more rides, more activities, more trees and really utilize the place to its full tourist attraction potential.",3.0
4065,expensive,Its very new and shiny. hope it maintains that way. Otherwise the rides were fun but the water/land park was kind small then anticipated,3.0
4066,Legoland Water Park and more,"I visited the Malaysia's Legoland website and it claimed to be the world's largest Legoland Water Park, but quite honestly, I find the water park rather smallish for the price we paid for. In less than 2 hours, my kids (4 and 6 YO), my hubby and myself had played every single slides and tubes available in the park. We were there on a weekday, over the Singapore's Mar school holiday, but surprisingly the water park was not at all crowded, so we never had to wait long to try out all the features in the park. I enjoyed lazing by the Build-A-Raft River with my family and my kids love all the slides and tubes, particularly the Brick-Blaster where I can join them in their tubes. My daughter played the Lego Slide Racers for many times, either racing against me or her dad.I find most of the staff at the Water Park friendly and helpful. There were some family rides that my son was restricted to play because of the height limitation, but the staff was kind enough to let us have him for at least once and then told us nicely that my son is too short for it and recommend other rides more suitable. And when I was alone with my son and we wanted to do the Red Rush which sit up to 6 person, the staff actually joined us so that the rubber tube can be more balanced and he kept my son entertained throughout the slide down.The Water Park closes earlier at 6pm, so taking advantage of our annual passes, we went to the main park after we were done at the Water Park; the nice evening weather and the lack of crowd made the visit so much more enjoyable than our first, where we had to battle the unforgiving sun. Even though we had only two hours before the main park closes at 8pm, we got the chance to go on many rides, some even multiple times.Some reviews had commented that the food in both parks were expensive and far from tasty, I would suggest eating at the Medini mall before and/or after visiting the park, there are plenty of eateries and fast food restaurants to suit your appetite at very affordable prices too.",4.0
4067,Amazed legoland Miniland,Very amazing miniland lego arts they have! Water park is quite fun and my kids enjoy very much. However the food inside the park is abit expensive. We took food outside the park such as KFC which we feel is quite affordable.,4.0

Service from the entrance all the way to the room n restaurant was perfect. Very friendly n happy staff. The room we stayed in was an adventure-themed room, which can comfortably fit 2 adults n 3 children. It has a double bed, a double decker bunk bed n a rollaway. Its an interactive experience everywhere in the hotel, from the bricks in the lobby to the music n disco lights in the lifts to the treasure quest in the room! U can also take pictures with the numerous lego figures in the hotel. Awesome for children! My boyfriend n i enjoyed being kids n reliving our childhood every single moment.",5.0

4074,An Awesome Double Park,"Legoland is a park full of Lego bricks. It is an awesome place for family and variety of attractions is excellent.We stayed in the legoland hotel for two days,we spent one in the water park and the other in the theme park.The water park was fairly big but really fun. All the slides were amazing and cool. Food was average. The wave pool is small but relaxing. We were disappointed that the Joker soaker was closed because it looked great to play in.The theme park was huge and fun. The driving school was our first stop because we were most excited to get the driving licence.The dragon coaster was super cool, I went three times. Project X has a huge drop which was hair-raisingly scary. Imagination was amazing and we had fun racing lego cars and seeing if our lego DUPLO models could stand an earthquake. There was a huge variety of food and it was fantastic. Asia's biggest lego shop was right there in legoland. Lego fans would go nuts over that shop. Also there was a bricks shop which was like a lego buffet.Overall I think it is excellent for anyone who likes water parks and theme parks.",5.0

4076,"Thumbs up for kids,lego fan but not for adults.","Overall it's an average experience given the interesting lego exhibits (models of different country's building ) and some rides like the dragon coasters,4D shows.....but I don't know bout you guys,the day I been to Legoland,it's been raining back and forth,making me finished all the 4D shows in a row.The rides was not exciting enough but I think it would be a great experience for the kids.I would not recommend  buying the waterpark ticket ,it's not worth it,sorry.",3.0
4077,"Great place, room for expansion and improvement...","My 2 kids (boy-7, girl-10) loved everything. It really is a haven for Lego-loving kids (and even those who aren't yet). Despite that, parents do get to do some things -- dragon coaster, boat ride, pharaoh treasure shooting game, 4D shows, pay for stuff at the Lego stores (!) ... otherwise kids have the run of the place. A mention on the Miniland. Extremely jaw-dropping Lego models of the Twin Towers, KLIA, KL train station, Angkor Wat, Tanah Lot, etc. etc. I could stare at everything all day... The express (which isn't really an express since it goes so slowly - but for good reason) offers a nice ride around the whole park. The guide/announcer should improve his English though; he could not be understood no thanks to bad pronunciation and horrendous grammar -- ""Please no standing the kids when train in motion... !"" ... errr.... ??Another important detail. Please ensure that staff know how to communicate with children. Training goes a long way and produces better-quality Malaysian citizens (out of Legoland staff.. isn't that a bonus). At the Nissan driving school, which was really fun, the staff seemed unable to properly educate the children on following road signs and obeying rules. Which I thought was the whole point of calling it ""driving school""..?? I counted at least 4 of them on duty, but they mostly stood at the starting point, and barked at the kids who were of course unfamiliar with left-hand drive, traffic lights, road lines, etc. I saw an employee run after a child who stepped out of his car (which stalled after a head-on with the curb), asking ""Why you step out of the car? Why you step out of the car?"" ... I mean, it's obvious WHY he stepped out. What do you want him to do; stay in the car? ALL smart parents know that, the way to direct a child is to speak in the positive -- ""Please stay in the car, do not step out, it is for your safety..!"" would be a better, quicker, more positive thing to say in that situation.Finally, overall the staff were rather friendly and helpful, although they can afford to be better at communication, and more adept at handling international tourists. I saw them struggle to understand someone asking at the Mindstorms area, where the 4D movie was. Staff just shook their head, saying ""No this is not the 4D movie"" ... yes, but where is it.. ? .... Communication is key.Sorry if it's plenty of criticism, but hopefully it goes towards continuous improvement...",4.0

The miniland is good, but i just wondering why tne fullerton hotel has the same height with marina bay sands hotel. You can also rent locker to keep your luggage for 40 ringgit. Because we need to catch the bus at 5 we are a little bit hurry and not all the games we tried, but, fortunately we didnt miss the waterpark. We love the lazy river and my daughter love the life vest because it prevent herto sink and can enjoy the pool.

4085,Legoland Malaysia,"We were visiting Singapore the week before Christmas and decided to visit Legoland Malaysia with our two young children. We booked the combination theme park ticket/bus pass through our hotel concierge, which was really easy. The bus service (WTS Travel) picks up/drops off at Singapore Flyer, and booking through the hotel got us a free shuttle ride to the Flyer (we had to make our way back to the hotel on our own at the end of the day).  I assumed that because Legoland was just across the border from Singapore, it would be an easy jaunt between the city and the theme park. Be forewarned--it took us three hours each way to travel between Singapore and Legoland. There are two separate stops for customs (one in each country); the Malaysia customs are efficient, the Singapore customs are not. Legoland itself didn't seem ready for prime time.  I can't help but compare it with the Disney parks, which pay careful attention to the whole experience. For example, it rained quite a bit on the day we were there, and a lot of the rides shut down. That wouldn't be so bad if Legoland had planned more thoughtfully for rainy days and had more things to do indoors and had designed more covered walkways around the park.  My advice for anyone visiting Singapore and looking for a theme park day is to go to Universal Studios--lots of fun and less travel time.",3.0
4086,One of our family's best days ever!,"I read some of the other reviews and can't begin to understand what some people can NOT like about Legoland.  My family and I went yesterday and we had so much fun!  We arrived a few minutes before it opened and stayed all the way until the end.  We went on a Friday and it seriously felt like we almost had the place to ourselves.  There were no lines at all.  Several times we even stayed on the roller coasters again and again because no one was waiting to get one.   We were recommended to book a the Lego Robotics class early as it fills up.  We did and still my boys were the only ones in the class.  Miniland is amazing.  We loved taking photos of all the buildings. We spent several hours at the regular LegoLand and then forced ourselves to leave and go to the waterpark as we had paid for a combo ticket.  We were disappointed there either.  OMG!  Floating down the Lazy River with the boys building legos while we floated... amazing!  The boys' dreams come true.  The big slides were amazing, as was the huge play structure where water fell, squirted, and splashed from every direction.   The lifeguards too were a lot of fun.  Everyone was fun and friendly, and clearly enjoyed their job.  I would highly recommend this park.  It isn't cheap but compared to other amusement parks, it was sooo worth it for us.  Bring sunscreen and water if possible and get ready to have a lot of fun!",5.0
4087,Not just for kids,"I had been to the Legoland in Denmark last year, and wanted to see if this park was as good. It certainly is.  Denmark seemed to have rides aimed at the smaller children whereas Malaysia seemed to have more altogether, with quite a few aimed at the ""older"" kids.  Being there without children,  we were mainly interested in the Miniworld.  The park is outstanding with miniatures of major constructions and countrysides focussing on the Asian region.  The number of models was astounding.  It just amazes me at the technology, time and effort that goes in to creating these masterpieces.  While it was quiet on the day we were there, I can envisage that the shelter from the strong sun is insufficient in busy periods.  The food outlets were plentiful, but not cheap, and the quality was not particularly high.",4.0

4090,Good...but if you are with kids,"I only went into Theme Park and not the Water Park...Itw as easy to access by road. I went on a Friday and therefore no rush. My 4 year old enjoyed all rides and due to NO QUEUE, we enjoyed few rides more than 3-4 times. For bachelor's or families without children, I fear not worth visiting unless you have nothing to do in Johor and spend couple of hours. Not worth the price. The prices are almost equivalent to Singapore's Universal studio and enjoyment -  far from that one,,Miniland is something worth seeing for Adults...There is option of eateries inside and few restaurant with local as well as International cuisine just at the entrance...so Food no issue. Outside food not allowed except snacks / quick bites for kids. Parking was Rm 1/ entry for the day I went. Purchasing Lego toys could be a costly affair as I found the prices higher than what Lego toys are sold via Toys R Us...even the rental prams for Kids was a little higher than usual. Looks like the cost is targeted more for Singaporians i.e. the cost of living in Singapore than Malaysians. Overall, if you have some work in Johor, do visit this place, but don't go Johor to especially see this if you have some other good theme parks around your area.",3.0

Well not for me the heat was too overwhelming that tarnish our spirits.3) If you have nowhere to visit in JB, this place can be considered (last in my list)..too boring4) Please go without any tourists expectation..! Majority of their staffs are not well trained towards that.You can see not much effort taken to serve visitors warm heartedly. 5) Legoland city build with Lego, ehmm you can just view it from Youtube, don't waste $$ just to view that.",3.0

We started by taking those easy games like car driving school, boating, and plane ride. Then there is a family game on fire fighting, the kids enjoy working together to put down the fire but I was so tired after the game which I can't play second round. Kid power tower is another game that require parent energy to pull the rope to bring us up the tower. Exhausting! Then, we went for some indoors games to stay away from the hot sun. Those includes ""lost kingdom"" where you sit on a train and shoot on objects for scoring. Then there are also few games for young kids like ""merlin challenge"", twister ride, pony ride and train ride. More exciting games for older kids are like ""boucing chair"", project-X, dragon train rides. As for show or cinema, kids love the magic show and 4D cinema show. Total of 4 type of 4D movie on show for different time, do check out the timing and plan for it. We exited the park around 7pm and took our dinner at Burger King inside the Legoland. It was a fun day for us!",5.0
4097,Legoland great place for children,Children definitely love to come here. I picked a day to theme park and another day for water park. Great visit. The only thing I felt unlike is the weather is too hot for outdoor viewing and playing around here.,4.0
4098,New place with lots of fun,"Visited here as a last minute change due to issues in Bangkok. Was a great surprise for the kids who are still talking about Legoland. Closer to Singapore than KL, legoland is in a new area so don't be scared if you feel like you're not where you should be. A hotel that is unmistakable in what it is with themed rooms and great in room activities for the kids. Close, like next door, is the theme park and water park, but also a mini mall giving you cheap and diverse food options for even the fussiest kid. Only bad thing about the hotel, being in a room so close to the theme park where the music started (and repeated) 8am to 8pm everyday. Was left disappointed when having to call for someone to come clean our room and upon checkout was left waiting as they were more focussed on check in. A good hotel that will get better with experience. Will stay again. ",4.0
4099,Dreamland,"Likes : 1) The plantations they have done to keep the place cool. Maybe recent but they seemed to have taken the customer comments seriously.2) Smiling faces of the lifeguards etc.3) My 5 year old loved the rides, especially the roller-coaster and the scary looking water slides. The few negatives -1) The huge waiting time due to the holiday season, but when else to go?2) The public changing rooms should be kept cleaner, no cleaning staff appeared in sight.3) The management needs to reply to the reviews, since this would create a positive impression.4) No proper shade in the water park area. Looked like they were selling shade, since they were renting the cabanas and no one was allowed to sit for free, even in the empty ones.",4.0
4100,Not only for kids,"First time visit legoland, it was quite interesting.  There are 3 roller coaster (1 for child), it was exciting.  There was special events during Lunar new year holiday like lion dancing,  making a lego horse and parade.   We spent 5 hours in the park.",5.0
4101,For all Lego fans,"Nice attractions for kids, but hot and humid due to the weather, and needs more sheltered walkways. Still, great for a day's outing.",4.0
4102,Great for family with younger kids,"It was a choice between Legoland or universal studios but after researching, I decided that Legoland was more suitable for kids our age...9, 7 and 6 as I did not want to explain to the youngest why he could not go on the rides.We stayed 2 nights and spent 2 whole days in the theme and water parks. The kids did all the rides and especially loved the Technic ride which they did 12 times and would have done more! The photo booths at each ride were great in giving us snapshots of us during the rides and cheap in comparison to what I had to pay at the Singapore zoo. Food selection was good, quality cannot be faulted and pricing was reasonable considering it was a theme park. Overall a good experience and we would certainly visit again next time we are in the area.",5.0
4103,Quick getaway across the border,Good place for the kids but height is always a problem with my 4-yr old son. They have minimum height requirements for most of the rides. Quite a few choices for food but not for shopping. Lack of directional signs for the bus stop going back to JB Sentral.,5.0
4104,Great place if you have younger kids,"We took our 14 year old son and a friend of his the same age to Legoland for the day last week, we travel to Singapore from Darwin when ever the airfares permit so this trip instead of hanging around Singapore all week we decided to go over the border to Johor Bahru for four nights and explore, well after Legoland not much else to do so left early but our day at Legoland was good, place looks very new as opened I think less than a year ago, although not Disneyland or Universal Studios still a nice setup, we just found that the attractions were more suited for younger kids say up to 10 or 11 just like Lego, my boy loved his lego but has grown out of it. Mini Land was amazing all the towns, cities and airports all made from Lego, was very interesting, all in all a good day and filled in time in Johor.",4.0
4105,Perfect for family,Most of the rides and activities are meant for younger kids and younger adults. Not much excitement as compared to Sunway Lagoon but it's still ok. Waterpark is fine too but the ride queue was too long waiting. Bring umbrella and good sun protection lotion as the place is hot and the trees are still small for shelter.,4.0
4106,Great day with the family,"Lots of things to do, if you go midweek then no queues, take a combo day ticket and do the water-park too. Lots of rides, Very clean, clean toilets and showers .. all nicely organised and kept clean. Food is available in the park and just outside at the entrance. Best thing to do is have your hand stamped and leave the park for lunch as there are more than 20 international restaurants and fast food outlets at the entrance. The park is suitable for all ages, but particularly kids under 12.. the teens would really enjoy the Water-park more. Lego land is on par with Universal Studios Singapore and the Water-park at sentosa. but for those visiting Universal with kids then it would be worthwhile for them to make it a 2 center holiday by visiting Lego land in Johor Bahru",5.0
4107,Kid's playground,"kids will surely enjoy this place. Loads of rides & activities for them. Amazing lego structures, interesting games & challenging ones too. Leaves the lids to be a little independent as well",5.0
4108,Excellent day of fun,If you or your children are lego funs then this is the place for you!  There are a number of rides from really tame ones for the little ones to  fast roller coaster rides.  There's also a 45 minute interactive robotics workshop you can do but you do need to book a time so go there first thing - look for giant lego Einstein head.  If you're not into rides then you can spend all day just looking at all the cool lego figures & sculptures.  There's also an area where they have built many famous landmarks from around the world out of lego.  Most excellent day if you're into lego!!!It was closed on Wednesdays at the time we were there.  Also suggest you pick up a tour from Singapore direct to Legoland rather than staying in Johor Bahru.,5.0
4109,good for children,"a good place to have fun for your kids, but remember to use a cap or bring an umbrella because it's very hot there. you can consider to bring a raincoat",4.0
4110,Good day outing for family ,This legoland is located close to Singapore border and is well designed for a day long family fun. My daughter enjoyed most of the dry rides. There is a water park attached to it as well and you'll probably need a second day for this attraction. Park and most rides are we maintained and staff is friendly. There are a few decent food options as well. We went by a coach from singapore and it took a lill over an hour to reach. ,4.0
4111,Must see - so much to see and do!,"We had sooooo much fun here! We booked a the tour while in Singapore - left at 8.45am and after going through immigration and crossing the border, we arrived at 11:35am. Mini Land was incredible, lots to see - Taj Mahal, Singapore, KLCC, Ankor Watt, Forbidden City, Merdeka Square, Vietnam + more!! There are lots of restaurants, as well as staff along the sidewalk in case you need to freshen up with an ice cold drink. There is a few big souvenir stores where you can buy all types of lego related toys! Lockers are located near the restaurants too, if you need to put all your items in there.Legoland Waterpark was included in our package which was also really awesome and a great way to cool down!Highly recommend to visit both! It's worth it :)",5.0
4112,Great fun for the family..specially the young 'uns,"I travelled to Legoland with my sister and family (2 kids - 7 and 4 years of age) and boy did we have fun. Admittedly, we went on a weekday after the school holidays were over so there were hardly queues for any of the rides, we could take our time to decide on rides and some the kids went again and again. Food at the various cafes are average but that's to be expected at any amusement park. Folks who are well travelled will understand this, it's not a spot for posh cuisine but good family meals.The rides are great for younger kids and I reckon those above 10 and teenagers will not have as much fun. Parents will have to get on some rides with younger kids, depending on height restrictions. Nothing beats seeing happy smiley faces of the kids after going on a ride. My nephew fell in love with the Lego store and we spent a lot of time browsing and picking up some gifts and even Lego items for ourselves. My sister told me that many of the items sold there were not available in Australia where they live, particular the large sets.Many folks have advised that it's hot as you walk around and YES it can be but there are shaded spots to run into for some respite with fans. Bring along a portable fan, if you must. Ensure you have sunscreen slapped on and/or a hat/cap on to stay cool. Stay hydrated and it will be a good trip.I can't say what this place would be like on public holiday or during the school holidays but we had a really pleasant day at Legoland. It took us almost all day to go through the various",5.0
4113,Time of our lives.,"We went to LEGOLAND just because we could.  The idea appealed to me and the other 2 travellers indulged me.  We are all so glad they did as it was just superb.  And let me say that there was not a legitimate child amongst us - our ages are 28, 58 and 62. Okay parts of the original park is a bit tame for us adults but would be perfect for youngsters.  The log ride was the only really excellent ride - the ghost train was okay too.  And the miniature village was amazing.  And the roller coasters were all that we could ask for.  But the  Water Park was outstanding.  We spent 4 of our 6 hours there and had the time of our lives.  We tried every ride - some more than once.  We got soaked but who cares.I notice some people on this site complained about the height restriction - you complain about something that keeps your child safe?  That's nuts.  The height restriction is there for a reason.  I can't believe people would complain about such a thing.A whole day is definitely necessary.  And next time we visit Singapore we will include an overnight trip to LEGOLAND.  The member of our group who lives in Singapore was annoyed that he hadn't visited LEGOLAND before this.",5.0
4114,Great for younger kids,"We went as a family of 4 (kids 4 1/2 and 2 1/2) and had a ball. We rented a driver from Singapore who dropped us at the gate, and then picked us up at an agreed time - it was a convenient option, although not the cheapest.As many have said, there isn't too much shelter, so you need to be prepared, but that aside, there's a lot of fun to be had. There's also a water park as part of the complex, although we didn't get there in the single day we had.We pretty much covered the entire park in about 6 1/2 hours. My 4yo and I went on most of the rides - we were lucky as it wasn't too crowded, so we never had to wait more than 10 minutes - we actually went back to back on some of the rides.They have some amazing Lego constructions built across the park, as well as reasonable ride variety (although it didn't feel as extensive as US / European theme parks). They also had well stocked shops offering all sorts of Lego and related items (clothing / games etc.) One thing I'd suggest is that teenagers might be quite bored - I felt the park was better suited to younger kids in the 4/5 - 8/9 range.I'd definitely recommend this as an excursion from Singapore if you have young kids and want to get away for a day.",4.0
4115,Super had fun,"We were ten in the group who visited LegoLand in November 2013. We super had an excellent time with the rides and just admiring the different structures made of legos. The designs of the different countries were amazing! Bring  extra clothes-just in case you plan to try the rides involving water-because, u are gonna get wet-no matter where you sit. If it is sunny-be aware of the weather-because if it is hot or sunny-bring an umbrella and tons of sunblock because there is no ""shade"" there. I would suggest that if you come to Legoland, go with your friends. The more, the merrier. =)",5.0
4116,Fun day out with Lego made son,We did a day trip from Singapore to Legoland. My 9 year old is Lego mad so this trip was something he has dreamed about for a long time. We were really lucky to have chosen to go at a time that all the local school children were at school plus it wasn't a busy time for tourists so there were barely any people there the day we went. We went straight to the front of the queue for all of the rides and in some cases could ride them over and over again because there were no people in the line waiting. The rides at Legoland are very much focussed on the younger children so anyone over the age of 10 might not find this place too exciting. There is really only 2 roller coasters and a ride where you get wet that suit the older kids and the rest is for little kids. Having said that the Lego models at the park are quite mind blowing and interesting for young and old. The food on site is average and the shops don't really sell anything that you can't buy in the shops in Australia (except the personalised keyrings which we bought). Overall we enjoyed our day at Legoland.,4.0
4117,Legoland & Waterpark Fun!,"Legoland ParkI was dreading the visit because friends have said it was hot and open. That is true but if you come prepared then it is fun. I suggest- a wide-brimmed hat - long-sleeved linen/cotton shirt- sunblock- sunglassesThere are lockers inside and outside the park to rent. Small RM20, big RM40. The rental is not refundable. Suggest you bring trolley bags for extra clothing etc. There are a few rides where you get splashed which will cool you off. The park's size is just nice to go around and there are shortcuts. There are plenty of places to sit/rest from the crazy sun and heat. Lots of eateries too but on the pricey side for locals like us.The baby room is excellent although they don't allow dads in there. Their reason is because there are breastfeeding moms. Well, I am a breastfeeding mum and see no harm if dads are in the same room. The staff were helpful but not up to par with USS. I hope this will change soon. The park was surprisingly clean with lots of rubbish bins around. You would need almost a whole day to do the whole park at a leisurely pace. We couldn't do all the attractions as it was busy. We will definitely return when it is a non-school holiday plus from 2014 Johor weekends will be Friday and Saturday.WaterparkFabulous. Just the right size with pools/slides for every age/level. Diapers given to babies/toddlers, can buy inside too (RM5 per piece). A variety of eateries although pricey but quality is good. Swim vests provided free. Swim shop has good selection of bathing attires, souvenirs etc. Changing rooms and seating area crowded so avoid weekends/major public holidays.Lockers not refundable. Bring a suitcase, waterproof wallet and camera instead.You would need half a day to really enjoy the waterpark.",5.0
4118,Legoland Malayasia,Travelled Legoland Malayasia located in Johar Bahru near the Malayasia-Singapore border. Overall experience was good and enjoyed a lot at Water Park which was opened recently. Though the Theme Park is also good but have nothing for the Adults in it.,4.0
4119,A Wonderful Experience,"We (kids 6 yrs & 8 yrs) went to Legoland in December 2013. It was a great experience filled with fun. Kids enjoyed it until they exhausted!We brought combo tickets at the gate to visit Water Park & Theme Park. Visited Water Park first. It is quite new (opened in October) so everything was new and very clean. Lot of life guards watching every where so not to worry about safety.Theme park got usual rides similar to any other theme park abut all are lego themed. Lot of amazing lego models were on display. The 4D cinema experience was great.Lines were not that bad as it was a week day. However one day was not enough for both parks. We entered at 10 am opening time and left at 8 pm closing time, yet we missed quite a few (rain interrupted about 1 1/2 hours during which all rides were closed).We stayed at Bayu Marina Resort hotel in JB and traveled by taxi cost about MYR30 one way. Lunch cost about MYR50 (they don't allow out side food, bags were checked at the entrance).Over all Legoland is very clean, organised and well maintained except few toilets which were very wet.Now there a Lego themed hotel on site if you want to avoid travelling.",5.0
4120,Legoland Johor Baharu,Queuing on ticket had some people try to sell their free ticket.The rides are new but it looks much older than other Legoland. I had been to few Legoland in Europe and the quality here are not impressiveEnjoy the Waterpark but again the local bumiputera can beat your queue as they have friends in front and just overpass us all the time and very annoyingFood are terrible as my 8 years old can prepared better hot chis than that and the other meals are tasteless. Food are bad as I spend over RM1000 for Lego products and food and I think I feel the place are over rated,3.0
4121,Great place - but only if you have smaller kids & high prices,"Legoland Malaysia is a creative funny place, and we enjoyed it very much - our kids are 4 and 7, and that¬¥s the perfect age. If you are adding the water park next to it you can also go with older kids, I¬¥m sure, but Legoland is very much a place for families with small kids - here and in the one we went to in Denmark. Be sure to get a discount either by booking online a week before, or via the taxis (the blue), otherwise it¬¥s very expensive = european prices. The park is surprisingly small (at leat compared to the original one in Denmark), but together with the water park perfect for a day. We went on a monday, and the lines were very short or not there = perfect :) ",4.0
4122,"Good place to go for people who wants to ""on-site"" travel","Excellent lego creations of the different wonders and landmarks around the world. I especially like the taj mahal and angkor wat.

Well done, Lego.",4.0
4124,Awesome Place,"I had a two-day fun with my family in early December 2013. The hotel was just nice and clean though we had to check out at 10.00 in the morning.

Got a 2 day tix Legoland plus Water Park package included in the Legoland Hotel package which included 2 days tix for 2 adults and 2 children which is really good value.Went to Legoland in London but found that Legoland Malaysia offers more interactive rides. The firefighters truck ride and car race at Lego City were really enjoyable as family activities. Lego Mindstorm was interesting for older kids as they get to participate in Robotics Workshop. Would we go again? Definitely a YES!  My kids already asked when can they go to Legoland again after 2 days. We are even considering getting the Annual Pass!",5.0

It was only a one day visit so we did not get the chance to try most of the attractions. Great to know that they provide adequate praying rooms, real food in the restaurants, baby care center, and family restrooms.Bring along hats, umbrellas, sunblock, and extra clothes. The whether was very hot and we did not see any water spray fans throughout the theme park.",4.0
4129,Expensive half day if outside of peak time,Standard lego experience with fun but not thrilling rides and really good models. We were lucky to visit early on a hot but showery day so the place was pretty empty. After 4 hours we'd done everything at least twice so we left. Overall it was fun but expensive (by Malaysian standards) for a family of 4.,3.0
4130,Improve maintenance!,"Overall great for young children, queues not too bad (30 min per attraction on a Saturday)... But simple maintenance on side attractions very poor, at least 90% of those buttons kids are asked to press on exhibits do not work.",4.0
4131,Room for improvement,"This resort is typical of Malaysia. They have invested in all the attractions, it looks great and a good day out but the service really lets it down. Staff are unhelpful and really unorganised. Luckily it's theme park for kids so it kind of runs itself and the service aspect doesn't really affect your fun. There is nothing for parents in the evening which is a shame and the TV is mostly Chinese channels. Making more kids is not really on your mind after being surrounded by 500 of them all day but there is nothing else in the area. Johor Baru is very dull. Worth a visit as kids will enjoy it. I was just disappointed because I think it could be so much better. I don't think they will get many repeat visitors.",3.0
4132,Time went so quickly,"This is our first visit to the Theme park in Legoland Malaysia 25/12/2013. It was so crowd because of the school holiday. I bought tickets for 3 adults and 1 6 years old child costs 520 Malaysian dollar. We were very lucky at that time because Legoland has an offer, buy a ticket in Dec. 2013 and get one free ticket in Jan. 2014. We returned back to it 7/01/2014 in our return back to Singapore. Inside was amazing to see all these lego characters. Mostly I believe it is for very little kids. We enjoyed the roller coasters, there are 3 of them, my little son enjoyed it too. Nice food inside too, so may be 3 hours not really enough for it. Our plan is to visit water pools in Legoland because it has different access to it.",4.0
4133,Great family fun we all loved it!,We took the 2 days combo for both Waterpark and Legoland I would recommend this. The first day we saw some of legoland but didn't feel rushed or time pressured because we knew we had the next day to finish it off. When it got too hot we went to the Waterpark on both days.Legoland is not really for teenagers. My kids are 9 and 10 years and it was perfect for them. The Waterpark however is great for any age.The staff are great and so happy and helpful.,4.0

4136,Definitely a place for Kids only...,"Me and hubby didnt enjoy Legoland much. In our point of view, the place was not that well maintained. As the price is similar level to any international franchise of themeparks, we were expecting more from Legoland JB. The toilets and changing rooms in the Water Park were dirty by the time afternoon came. No one was constantly cleaning the toilets and changing room areas. Floor was flooded. I decided to bundle up my daughter and drive back straight to our hotel for our bath instead. In other areas like wave pool, there were trays of food all over the floor. There were no cleaning crew doing the clean-up. Most of the ppl working there, looked so bored with their jobs. Just so disappointing. The only person that enjoyed it was my 7-yr old daughter..So, nett nett,it was definitely a place for kids.",3.0
4137,"Good Park, horrible commute","This is my second time visiting Legoland Johor. The first time was an enjoyable experience for me, my wife and my 7 year old daughter that this time, I took my whole family there (mom, dad, borther and his family, sister.. etc). Little did I know that the commute to Legoland took much longer than our park visit. We left on the 9.30 coach from Spore Flyer, and spend about 4+ hours on the road. Most of it was spent on queuing on both side's immigration post. Such horrible experience.  We arrived at around 14.00, and since we are scheduled back to Spore on the 17.30 coach, we only had about 3 hours time exploring the park. After a very late lunch, we set off exploring the park. Due to the time limit, we ended up only experiencing 2 rides, the dragon roller coaster and the smaller roller coaster. The park itself is nice. It is really a park for Lego enthusiast, with very good attention to details. We enjoyed the little time we have on the park. The commute back to Spore took only less than an hour. So unless there's a huge improvement on the immigration post on both sides, I really doubt we will come back to Legoland again.Such shame though, considering that the park is really enjoyable.",3.0

As big as Paradise but that doesn't take away from the magic. Truly a bucket list worthy adventure! Thank You Country Travel Mart for all the arrangements made. The staff were so happy & polite.,5.0
4141,Not worth it,"Our trip was mainly planned around Singapore but thought that Legoland Malaysia might be worth visiting.  It turns out, the total travel time it took to reach Legoland was not worth it.  It took around 4 hours by bus to legoland, which includes the grueling experience of going through two immigrations (Singapore and Malaysia).  We had to do this twice as our hotel is in Singapore.  I don't remember exactly, but they advertised that it only takes around 45 minutes to get to Legoland, I was deceived!  But maybe it was because of the holiday season, we visited at the end of the year.  We left the hotel at around 0830 and got there at 1230.  It was lunch time when we arrived, so it was time to get some grub.  We ate at the Market Restaurant.  The experience was horrifying!  It felt like we were in prison eating prison food.  Everything just looked sloppy and everything tasted pretty bad.  A school cafeteria is definitely better in all aspects compared to this place.  I am no stranger to theme parks and I can say that they did a pretty bad job on this one.The park itself has a feel that it was neglected and poorly maintained.  Hopefully they change their management sometime in the future or this park will just rot quickly.  Considering that Legoland is an international brand, it does not compare to Universal Studios or Disneyland.  It pales in comparison.  Huge difference.  Some of the staff are also very gloomy, they don't seem to love their jobs.  How can they expect to make customers happy if they themselves are not.  The only redeeming factor we had was the playground, our child enjoyed it.  She was able to run and scream to her heart's content.  I also enjoyed the Miniland attraction, the details are stunning.  I just hope they maintain them well.  Some of the attraction have technical issues already, considering this is just a newly opened area.We have seen and visited Legoland Malaysia, they did not give us enough reason to come back.",1.0
4142,A park for the little ones to enjoy,"We came to visit via Singapore.  From our hotel along Orchard Road, we hired a private van to take us directly to Johor, Malaysia.  It was around 45 km from our hotel according to Google Maps.  We left our hotel at around 8:00AM and arrived by 9:45AM (after going through 2 immigration points).  There was some traffic build up near immigration.  We expected the park to be packed due to the holiday season and the December school break.  It was a nice time to go in December as it was not that hot.  It rained for a short while in the afternoon.  We went right after Christmas the queues were running with 30-45 minutes wait time.  Not so bad for a busy season.  Most of the rides cater to young children. We veered left as we entered the park and did the Project X (mini rollercoaster ride) first.  We queued 45 minutes just for that ride.  The smaller kids in the group did the Aquazone Wave Racers opposite Project X which had almost the same wait time.  We went for the 4D Studios next and got to watch Racers 4D.  We did not have to wait long but the show was a big disappointment - probably because we were expecting it to be somewhat like Shrek 4D in Universal Studios.  We did Lost Kingdom Adventure, a laser tagging interactive ride, next.  It was a big hit for the little ones.  We went on the water ride:  Dino Island and did not have to wait very long maybe because people didn‚Äôt want to get wet that day.  After drying off in the dry pods, we went to the driving school.  The wait to get to drive those cars was horrendously long.  Apparently it was like the highlight for the small ones so it wasn‚Äôt something we could miss.  We didn‚Äôt want to go back to Singapore late so we headed back by 4:00PM.    It took a little over 2 hours to get back to our hotel in Singapore.  No problem with the queues out of Malaysia but there was a line that went quite slowly going back in to Singapore.  **TIPS**Buy your tickets online.  I‚Äôm not sure if it runs continuously but if you buy 7 days in advance online, you get 20% off your ticket price.  If you have little kids with you who will want to go to the driving or boating school, that‚Äôs the first thing you should go for as the park opens.  The park accepts SGD but will change you in MYR.  Try to make sure you bring loose SGD bills if you won‚Äôt be staying in Malaysia after your visit to the park so you don‚Äôt end up with a lot of MYR.Legoland discourages bringing in food and drinks as I‚Äôve checked in their website but they are not particular about the drinks.  They strictly do not allow any form of food (including chips and biscuits) but they did not mind and let our water bottles through.  Note that there are no water fountains around the park.  Only bottled water for sale.Unless you are a below 10 years old or a big Lego enthusiast, Legoland will have little to offer for you.  For our big group of varying ages, only the young ones had their share of fun in the park and would say that it‚Äôs the best part of our trip.  For us who were young at heart, it was enough to see the smiles on the faces of the little ones.  For the seniors, they felt it was a complete waste of time.  :-)  If your trip is intended for the little ones, you could check out Legoland hotel and waterpark and maybe plan a night or two.",3.0
4143,Forgettable rides in a low-quality park,"Our visit on a bright sunny morning quickly turned barely-contained excitement into disappointment.  Our little girls aged 3 and 7 grew bored of the theme park within minutes of our arrival.  Not only the rides were too simple, but there was no audiovisual that makes each ride an ""experience"".  Queuing for a ride was simply a long-faced wait in a bare wall-and-railing room.  The heat from lack of cover and greeneries made the walk and wait even less entertaining.  Despite the newness of the place, the weather-worn look of the buildings and the squeakiness of some rides brought only regret of money wasted.",1.0

4145,More training needed,"The theme park is designed as good as the other Legoland that I had visited in Florida.  However, in general, all across the park, the attendants were doing a lot of horse play, which can be annoying to the visitors.  Secondly, except for the main shop, I was surprised to find out that the shops in the park were closed at the same time as the park closing time which did not leave me anytime to buy things from the shops which I think is a loss of revenue for the park.  They should keep it open for at least another 30 minutes after the park is closed since some of the stuff cannot be found in the main shop.",3.0
4146,Great Day spend with kids,"Legoland had two parks...a theme park and water based park.. we went for the theme park and were quite intrigued by the miniature city made with Lego spread across a major part of the park. This had waterbodies with moving boats and ships and one with also a pirate ship shooting water canons.Some of the rides were great for young kids. The line was long for the boat ride, so we gave that a miss.Overall great family day spend...",4.0
4147,Good for one day ,We spent a day at Legoland. What a lovely place to go. The rides were super fun and then longer we ever had to wait was about a few minutes. ¬†it is funny seeing kids from various counties all trying to drive around and explore. Our son loved it and received his own Legoland drivers license. ¬†i recommend for one day only ,4.0

4149,More suitable for children below 12~,"Despite the hot weather, overall the themepark is quite ok. I like the "" Lego statues"" the most, they are awesome! All of them are really made by lego brick and some even have music! Besides, it is a good place for photographing, especially the ""Lego Mini World"". You can see the landmarks of each city in mini sizes, and they look exactly the same! And for the facilities, I think they are quite boring as they are more suitable for children...The food is better than my expectation and it is not too expensive ( compare with the food in other theme park).The water park ticket is not included in the themepark ticket. It is fun, but too small and quite crowded == so far the cleanliness is still ok. The most special thing is, the slow river is full of lego bricks!!! Thus, you can play them while relaxing on the float and truly, that is a great idea.And my advice, please bring along your umbrellas, sunblock or hats, the whether is extremely hot! You can just wear slippers and bring your raincoat as well because some of the facilities will make you totally wet!",3.0
4150,Gives credits to the staff,"We were expected to have a lot of people on Sunday but it turned out to be very little people (due to Johor state changes the Sunday to be a weekday). We first went to the water park as we scared need to queue up for long but it turned out that we didn't need to queue up at all. We went on play for few rounds on each ride and all the staffs were very helpful on helping us to take photos though it was not their job. I was thankful that we had a lot of photos on water park side and gave us lots of memories back in our home.Then, we went ahead to the theme park and again we met some very nice staffs. My friends went to play the Project X and the staffs even persuaded them to go for second and third round. It was like a family feeling through the conversations. A special thanks to Roy, as he gave us a lot of information on legoland especially the products.",4.0
4151,Better than expected,"We loved the Waterpark. The themepark was ok, but the waterpark made a whole lot of difference. the lines were short and fast (given we were there on a holiday) park food was better than I expected from any themepark, though not too many choices, but what they had was good and reasonable (for a themepark). Waterpark-  Bring a waterproof bag or don't carry anything at all. To enjoy the park, you must be ready to get wet, soaking wet! For the themepark - dress lightly and wear comfortable slippers. Extra shirts for the kids and drinking water. Use sunblock! It can get really hot, humid and expect light drizzles.",4.0
4152,"good for once, but not worth coming back","First its far out from the JB central, you have to commute (for us we took a shuttle bus) to get there.The rides are not that spectacular but kind of an average for me. The Q was long.. The staff on the arcade game deliberately punched in 2 games for us to play when my wife clearly uttered for only 1 game.. feels like they are on a commission basis, and they try to bargain things for you , staff are bargaining that you play a number of games and will guarantee you a prize... makes me feel the place is cheap..the weather when we visited was a little bit damped in the afternoon (December 2013). so if you plan to visit.. check the weather.. bring umbrella m they sell rain coats but you will sweat surely in there..the place is good but we have seen better theme parks!",3.0

We decided to leave two hour earlier from 4pm to 2pm. ",2.0
4155,Great for small children,"Visited with 2 children (3 and 5 yo). It was great for older child but younger (under 1m height) were nit allowed on many rides.Coach transfer with WTS was ok. Going thru' Singapore and Malaysian immigration and customs can get very crowded and slow. Next time will opt for private car transfer for S$200 per day.Although, the theme park is well designed, they must have forgotten about the climate as it can get really hot with nowhere to escape. Universal Studios Singapore and other outdoor complexes have cool air vents, fans, mist sprays and shaded seats.Staff were very unhelpful and did not speak much English. Most times they looked bored. Nearly all information given to me were incorrect. So I stopped asking ... Below are tips from my experience:1. Food and drinks are readonably priced. Do not needed to bring it in. That does not mean its good food or drinks but ok as oneoff lunch in foreign place.2. Right half is better, start from right side.3. Legos are more expensive. There are some unique items so resist the temptation if possible. 4. As coach driver to stop somwhere near Cityhall. This will same return trip frkm Singapore flyer.Overall, it was a funday for our kids. We will return very soon.",4.0
4156,Loved it,"Legoland was Great, My wife, my 6 year old son and I spent the whole day at the theme park. To Bad because of the weather some of the rides had to closed, also we were to late for the water park. The Park itself need more trees or outdoor fans,since the day could be really hot and humid. Need Water Tap to drinks, coz the water bottle is quite costly as every other meals inside the park. So overall, it was an excellent first time experience for my family.  ",5.0
4157,A lot of Fun,"We took the kids and they had a lot of fun.Bring your sunblock and a fan for the stroller it gets hot.Its a small theme park and the kids will enjoy it, a good day out and if the ques are long you will spend the whole day there.  Food was decent and the prices are very reasonable compared to other theme parks where they overcharge for everything. If you are in Johor / S'pore you must add this to the list of things to do.We were staying in KL and drove down for 2 days to visit the park and get away from KL city.  Its a 4 hour drive and the stops on the highway were fine and worth it.",4.0
4158,Fun if out of crowded periods,"2  adults 1child 10y. Combo tickets lego+water parkFun because it was jan 2nd so week period and singaporean kids were at school. Be prepared with water, sunglasses and sun cream: park is recent so no big trees for shadow, and if you book 1 week in advanced you get good discount on their web site. It was fun and could enjoy everything with reasonably priced drinks and meals. Combine with water park in the afternoon to refresh.And if some of you is fan of lego, it's a must go",4.0
4159,Legoland Fun for Kids,"It was a free and easy trip with my female friend from Singapore to Malaysia legoland. We took as bus, CW3 from Jurong Bus interchange to Tuas 2nd link.We took the bus and continue the trip to Malaysia immigration checkpoint. But both me and my friend have missed the 11.30am bus so we have hoped on the same CW3 bus.As the instructions from the Legoland website about going to Legoland is quite confusing and we are feeling a bit lost, we asked the bus driver on how to get there.The driver was kind enough to tell both of us that either we will take a bus or taxi from the bus terminal.He told us that the bus will route a longer route to reach the destination and cost only 3RM, where taxi defers from it. But a taxi would cost 20 RM.Considering we wanted more time at Legoland and it almost 12 noon, we took a taxi which doesn't run on meter.I felt that was lucky that was a sunny day when I arrived at Legoland. But the taxi driver told both me and my friend that it would be better if it's not so sunny as we would be tanned. I also found out from the taxi driver that it was also a public holiday on that day due to the Johor Sultan's Birthday and would be crowded than usual. The taxi driver was friendly and 20RM for bring me and my friend there safe was definitely worthwhile.We do not immediately see the Legoland entrance and ticket office When we went reached there. Instead, there is a concourse with shops and restaurants especially at the centre and both sides of the concourse. For shops, there's Royal Selangor, shops selling souvenirs, clothes, tidbits and others. For restaurants, there's KFC, Burger King, Secret Recipe, BBQ Chicken and others. Both me and my friend had Chicken rice for lunch. It was delicious and having lunch at those restaurants would be more advisable than in Legoland.After having lunch, we moving on to buy tickets from the ticket office. There's people queuing for the ticket and looks crowded, but the queue was fast. While queuing, I can see staffs dressing as elves and they are sculpturing balloons for kids. I guess is because Christmas is coming. There is also constant playing of the Legoland theme music. It can be quite irritating for adults. While buying the tickets, the ticket office staff asked where me and my friend are from. After which, he offered us a pair of tickets and welcome us back next month. Great!While queuing to enter the into Legoland, you will be able to see that is the newly Legoland hotel at the left side of the entrance will huge Lego figurines at the entrance of the hotel. When passing through the gantry to Legoland, that staff would scan the bar code on the ticket. You can keep the ticket a souvenir. After passing the gantry, at the right hand side there is a customer information office, where you can an enquire for a taxi or for other services. In front and beside the customer information office, are toilet, restaurant and a shop selling Lego souvenirs. The entrance is also the exit of Legoland.After passing the restaurant enter the entrance gantry and turn left, you would be able to see the Technic zone located beside a man made pond. In Technic zone, be sure to ride on the Project X, Technic test site. It is 1 of the 3 roller coaster rides in Legoland. Many people are queuing for it. While queuing I manage to oversee the Water Park. There is also lots of people at the Water Park and looks fun. Before taking the ride I heard a Indian child crying after the ride. I thought that its only a single incident. I took the ride and find it a bit too much even for me as roller coaster experienced adult. The excitement is at the first part of the ride. Like any other zones, the place has push-cart liked shops that sells snacks like hot dogs, tidbits, and soft drinks. There are also Lego sculptures (robots, rabbits, lady painter, Ribena berry, parrots, dinosaurs, giraffe, music instruments, joker, dragon teaching young dragons and etc) souvenir shops, funfair games, restaurants and sites for kids. For Minion fans, the Minion pushie is huge and in good quality. Do bring a big bag and use 5 - 10 RM to try your luck to win a Minion back.There are also lockers, prayers' rooms and child care rooms.Walking further down, you would reached Kingdoms zone where you will see dragons and knights. I took the kid and adult version of the dragon ride. The kids version makes you feel bit dizzy with many turns, while the adult version has a combination of turnings and accelerating from heights. It would be better to take breaks between roller coaster rides. After the ride, you can buy some souvenir located in front of the castle. Overall, the kingdoms zone is a great place to take pictures especially at the castle.At the imagination zone, you can catch the 4D movies at different timings. It was a long wait just to catch the movie. I have watched Racers 4D.  The movie set at a futuristic world where a young racer and his team members are competing agains other teams especially one of the team has a Darth Vader like character. While competing, young racer outrun other racer but also has set back. However, there are robots helping him to get back to the racer and eventually....The movie doesn't have any dialogue and involves water/foam sprinkling. It can be cold at times to accompany with the progression of the movie. For the Land of Adventure, do ride on the water adventure ride. The ride will bring you up to the tower and down where the water will splash on you. The ride was refreshing especially after having much activities under then sun.  Here's some tips in order not to get too wet: Do bring the poncho, wear quick dry clothing and remember to bend down before water splash into the boat. Alternatively, you can bring extra clothing or pay to use the body dryer.For the Egypt zone (sorry I didn't take notice of the name of the zone), do take a ride on the Lost Kingdom Adventure. The ride is kid-friendly and was fun as you only need to held your ""hair-dryer"" and start shooting at the red dots. Although, there was 2 times when there was a power shut down and the points being reset. My friend and I enjoyed it lots.The Lego City was basic a place for taking pictures with life size Lego structures. You can take a ride at the Legoland express where it will take you a ride on the tram and tour around for sightseeing.However, beware of long queue. At the center of the whole Legoland theme park, there are several miniatures of the world wonders. There are also Singapore Flyer, several Malaysia iconic buildings and structures.It is great place to take pictures. There are buttons located near the Lego sculptures / structures where you will see some demonstration (combination of movement and sounds) after pressing the button.About going back, you can enquire the customer information office near the entrance. You can also take a taxi in front of the concourse after the Legoland entrance. The taxi there usually runs on meter.Overall, I felt that that the place has lot of facilities for kids than adults, there isn't much varieties of activities to choose from and each zone is not big enough to explore.",3.0
4160,Great for families with small kids and photographers!,"We booked our 1D Legoland Tour package from Five Stars Tour at SGD58/nett per pax which includes Two ways coach transfer by 45 seater coach and a One Day Legoland Pass. Checked in at Golden Mile at 08:30 and the coach picked us up at 18:30.The park is bigger than Universal Studio Singapore with an area of 70 acres with the latter being 49 acres. Needless to say, the Legoland tickets are also cheaper! It's located right in the middle of a big piece of still-undergoing-development-land. There are absolutely nothing around but a small mall - Medini Mall, located right in front of the park. So even if you got bored with the park, you can't go to any other place nearby but to stay in the park and wait for the time to pass to catch the coach back to Singapore. That's exactly what happened to us..There are seven zones of attractions: Miniland, The Beginning, Land of Adventure, Imagination, LEGO Kingdom, LEGO Technic, and LEGO City. Located right in the centre of the park, where you will be impressed by how they actually built the different Asian landmarks using LEGO bricks.Here are some of our personal tips to you:Tips 1: Go on a weekday or a Sunday to avoid the crowd. Tips 2: Bring your sunblock/ sunscreen! Tips 3: Remember to bring enough water supply (unless you don't mind paying for the overpriced drinks inside the park) Tips 4: Eat at Medini Mall for more varieties and cheaper food. Tips 5: Be careful of the ink of the re-entry stamp if you don't want the stamp ink to stain your shirt! All in all, I'd say it's worth the visit and be impressed by all the Lego sculptures! Definitely a great day out for families with small kids and as well as photographers. Ironically, I don't think I'd ever go back for a second time in the near future..",3.0
4161,Loved the waterpark more than the theme park,"Legoland was fun for all ages but for the adults, it was the water park that was a big hit. However, I noticed that there are a few things that need improvement, in my opinion, to wit: i) The bathroom at the waterpark was also very slippery - a lawsuit waiting to happen. When I complained, my 7 yr old son pointed out that it was going to be wet and slippery because we were in a water park after all. Still, I would have expected that there was an attendant cleaning up or mopping the floors as it was really difficult to walk around in the changing area and bathroom.ii) the concessionaires accept singapore dollars as currency but the staff did not volunteer this information. When I was trying to get a locker and cabana, I asked if i can pay via credit card as I ran out of ringgit but the staff only shook his head. When I went to buy something at the store, I asked if they accept singapore dollars and they said that it is acceptable. Wished I asked when I was trying to get a locker and cabana as it was very inconvenient and hot lugging around my things and waiting under the sun.iii) the staff were not too friendly and helpful (see item ii above) - they were not rude but they looked bored. Granted we went on a weekday and there were not a lot of people in the park so it must have been a long boring day for most of them. iv) we noticed that there were fewer rides in this legoland themepark compared to the one in San Diego but I saw a lot of construction going on so i guess there will be more rides to look forward to in the future. v) Found the entrance fee reasonably priced especially with the 20% discount for early purchases. vi) All in all, it was a fun and great experience for our group of 11 family members which included 4 kids below the age of 8.",4.0
4162,Our 7 and 8 Year Old Boys loved it!!!,"We visited in September with our two kids, aged 7 and 8.  They loved it.  There are rides suitable for younger kids, and some for older kids, enough to keep many ages happy.  We found it reasonably priced, especially compared to Singapore.  We went as a day trip from Singapore.There is not a lot of shade and it does get hot.  Take sunscreen.  The 4D cinemas and indoor Lego building areas were good to keep cool.  Recommend the Mind Storms activity for kids 8 and over.  You need to book into one of the sessions.  Head to the activity and put your name down.  We did not realise this was there until the end of the day, otherwise I think the kids would have done two sessions.",5.0
4163,"Long travel and tired, but fun!","Good experience for a day trip at the park second time.  The lego architecture are fantastics.  Games and rides are fun.If you are planning for a day-trip from Singapore, plan for an early departure.  The Singapore immgrations are so slow that the total travel time on coach would be about 45 mins but the queues at immgrations can take you 1.5 hours at Singapore.  Malaysia immgrations are more efficient that 30 mins can get you through.You can spend SGD in the park.",4.0
4164,Waterpark not really for toddlers,"We bought 2 combo tix for adult and used 30% voucher we got from a vendor at KL International Automobile expo. My 4yo got in free using the cutout from some milk box promo. Queue at the entrance was long but we managed to get the ticket in 30minutes time. I guess it was alright as we once had to q for almost an hour at the singapore zoo. It was quite cloudy when we reached the place and was advised to go to the waterpark first bFunny thing was we were told by a staff there (when we asked him where's the waterpark located) that the waterpark is everywhere. He said we will see waterparks along the way. The waterpark was actually on the left side after the entrance. We eventually found the waterpark when we are abt to exit the place and the crowd was really heavy at that time. I would strongly advise anyone with toddlers (mine is 2 and 4 respectively) to play at the waterpark first as the crowd tend to get busier in the evening. There was not much to play for my 2yo. He actually passed the min heights for certain rides but min age for most of the rides is 3yo :( It was frustrating but we just had to respect the safety guidelines. There are a few playgrounds along the way so we just had to make few stops to let my 2yo play. One think i hate about legoland is the souvenirs. Not from the souvenir shops (though it is quite expensive). Im comparing it with universal studios singapore and wb movie world gold coast i visited before. In USS and MW we get cool tumblers when we buy drinks. Even the kids meal came in cool container. You wont get that in Legoland. The 'coolest' thing they have is small tumbler with cheap sticker on it. Anyone can easily print the sticker and stick it to any plain tumbler and claim that he went to Legoland, really. We ate at the pizza place in Legoland. Had to fork up 65 for a tasteless regular pizza 4 bowl of soups and drinks. Should have eaten smtg else. Our last stop was the waterpark. Its only open until 6pm and it was already 430pm when we reached there so had limited time to play. I would say older kids (8yo onwards) would enjoy the place. My kids love the kids pool. They also went to the big water playground but got intimidated after awhile. The changing rooms are always full (must be due to holiday season) and wet. But Legoland staff are always there to clean the place. All in all we enjoyed the place. Would love to come again but might skip the waterpark next time around until kids are little bit bigger. Oh and someone took our legoland buggy! We left it at the waterpark entrance and it was gone! Complained to the management and got a replacement. Lucky we took everything out fm the buggy already. Mgmt said their staff wont collect any buggy until the park is closed so we suspect some visitors might have taken it. ",4.0

4167,Waiting for more improvements,"I went to Legoland Malaysia last August with my friend. We bought the tickets at the WTS travels in Singapore which includes roundtrip transfers from Promenade, Singapore to Legoland in Johor Bahru Malaysia, vv.It is a great place for Lego enthusiasts as almost all of its decorations are made of lego. The Asian destinations made of lego bricks are absolutely my favorite. The dining experience was good since they offer a huge variety from Malaysian dishes like curry to bugers and hotdogs. The attractions also ranges from very kid-friendly to extremes.Some Improvements: August is already the rainy season in the Philippines. But it was a different story when we went to Legoland. It was really hot and dry. One thing the administrators of the park should do is provide more shady places for people to stay or rest. In terms of staff and manning, I think they have to perk up some more and be more jolly. Hey, it adds to a visitor's experience.I've been to Universal Studios Singapore and Hong Kong Disneyland. And I've visited Ocean Park Hong Kong as well and they are still way ahead of this park. Well, I am giving it few more years to develop and improve since it just opened in 2012. All in all, it was still a memorable experience visiting Legoland Malaysia. I am looking forward to visiting this place again, say, after 5 years when it is more developed. :)",3.0
4168,Great for Lego lovers,"Legoland Malaysia is a great place to take kids. We went on a weekday at the beginning of the December school holidays. The weather was not so great as it was raining slightly, but that probably kept the crowds away. We were able to access all of the 4D movies and most of the rides. We spent the whole day there and could have gone for another day. On the downside it is a bit expensive and there is no great discount of purchasing the Lego there as it seems to be cheaper outside at other stores in the region. Overall our family had a really enjoyable and memorable day.",4.0
4169,Great day out,"We visited midweek on a day when the local and Singapore schools were open and it was cloudy with no rain.  So it wasn't too hot and was very very quiet - we had multiple rides on each of the roller coasters with out having to get out of our seats. Lots of rides in both the main park and water park for kids of 95cm and above - much more that Universal in Singapore. It was up to the standard of other Merlin parks, though knowing how hard it is to find staff in this part of Malaysia I imagine that isn't the case when it is very busy. Discount vouchers are widely available in Singapore e.g Toys R Us, so 2 of our 3 kids got in for free. That though means the annual pass only saves money with 4 or 5 trips, which would be way too many for us.",4.0
4170,once a time is enough,"If you are first-time, go from the right to driving school first (long wait), then to boat ride (slow rifde, expect to wait) and train to tour center part of park, next to adventuire and techno. Of all the rides, the ""dragon"" is of most challenging and excitment, but not for the weaker heart, others can try the technic strom before attempting the ""dragon"". All rides aim aty kids 4-12yrs and will be most fun for them. the games store is abit expensive, so beware on how you spend. fodd and drinks are of average and pizza mania is worth a bite. if you are still around after sunset, go visit the miniland. good effects and lighting. oh yes, reminder to bring your waist puch or si=ome bags tha cen be locked as some rides demands your losse belonglings to be left behind... Watch out and bring water-proof bags for the Dino-island ride, sure WET!! its fun, but wont returned if no offer. parking is a hassle as its a good 8min walk to the park. oh and you need to pay before leaving, can pay by ""Touch n Go"" also. if your driving, we got lost following the park coordinates, and ended up in some mud trek. just had to go one big round and back to the correct entrance/expressway. on our way bck we see the tunnel close, so maybe its still under-construction, so we cant enter by there.

4172,Lots of fun for Lego enthusiasts,"We went on an overcast drizzly weekday with 2 children (aged 10 and 8) who both love Lego. We all had a great time. We didn't find it too busy or have very long waits (except for driving school) which was maybe due to the weather. I was impressed with the Lego touches everywhere, even Lego bees and butterflies!! I can understand previous reviewers who have said its more for younger children as I would've thought the rides wouldn't satisfy thrill-seeking teenagers. But, having said that, there were lots of teenagers who appeared to be having a great time. Also, the 4d movies were enjoyable but not of the quality of other theme parks, eg seats didn't move and was the same basic effects in every movie - but we still enjoyed them.All in all a great day. Don't think you could do both Lego parks in one day. Lego hotel looks great!Would I go again? ProbablyWould I recommend it? Yes!",4.0
4173,"Great for younger, preteen kids and lego fans of all ages.","Our boys, aged 7 and 9, absolutely loved it!  The mindstorm session was especially fun.  The boys got to program a lego robot though a series of tasks.  There are a few rides aimed perfectly at that 4-10 age group. The miniland, a range of Asian landmarks built out of Lego, is pretty incredible to see and we loved it, but to get the most out of it you'd have to be into Lego. When we were there they were about to open the water park which looked great and good for adults and teenagers alike! We booked a driver for the day (to take us there and back from Singapore) which was definitely the most expensive way to do it but we didn't want the hassle of making sure we got to the coach on time.  All up we spent a very full day there and could easily have stayed longer. A reminder that you'll need your passports to cross the border.",4.0
4174,More lines,Legoland is very similar to the theme parks in the States. The lines are all around 45 minutes it seemed. You could lose a day without any trouble Mini land was really interestingBox ticked,4.0
4175,A great place for kids and adults.,"We checked this out because we wanted to see what the resorts were like and it was fine.  There are enough rides for kids, and a few for adults, so that everyone should have a good time.  The 4D movies were really enjoyable and fun.  The lines were short so that made it nice.  However, if it had been busy, I think it would have been a pretty long time in between rides and movies so that would be a serious issue with kids.Also, make sure to bring sunscreen and hats as it gets very hot and there is very little cover here.  Hopefully they will expand it and make it larger as it isn't that big of a resort at this point.",4.0
4176,Great if your kids are the right age,"We had a great time at Legoland Malaysia.  Our kids are the perfect age for this park between 3 and 6.  I think that if our kids were mich older, they would find the park lame and uninteresting.  As it is, my kids are thrill ride seekers and even though they are quite young, rides like the Royal Joust provided little entertainment.I was concerned when we drove into the parking lot. It was very scattered and garbage was everywhere.   Know that it was just a parking lot, but, it is the first impression.  At least pave the whole parking lot, it looks a lot better thn gravel. The walk to the park was reasonable, especially if you compare it to Disney parking lots and the distance to the parks.  We were able to quickly purchase our tickets.  I did find the price to be quite steep for this park, but, we were given free tickets to return sometime in January, which we likely will do as we will still be in the area.From the time the park opened until about noon, the park was not busy at ll which was awesome for our kids who got to ride The Dragon 5 times in a row without getting off.  Is happened with some rides in Technic as well.  Afternoon got much busier, but the longest line we stood in was about 20 minutes.Food and drinks are not as ridiculously priced like some theme parks.  My biggest problem with this park is that there are height and age restrictions.  So, our 3 year old who was tall enou for all but 2 rides, could not go on many others because he was 3.  Like the Royal Joust.  So, once we learned that, we just told e people at the gate that he was 4...which he will be soon anyway.  I found it silly that he also could not ride the teacup type ride because he was too short.  I took my 8 month old daughter on the teacups at Disney. Some of the restrictions need to be reevaluated.Probably the best thing that happened was that it rained.  Wen iT rained, the park cleared out.  We waited for the rain to pass and as a result, 6 until 8 was fantastic because again, our kids could ride the bigger rides repeatedly without waiting in line.I did tend to notice that the park was not really wheelchair accessible.  A lot of stairs and not many ramps.If you are in Johor Bahru with kids ages up to 7 or 8, it would be worth going to Legoland.  We did not go to the water park as I heard it was a waste of time.  Also, one day was enough for us because it was not busy, but with the free pass to go back, we will because our kids have been asking.",4.0
4177,Theme park with 5 coaster rides and water theme park,"On a hot day, you will find it hard to get shade in the water theme park, so do consider Cabana rental, which is RM300 per day, with 5 mineral water bottles and 5 soft drinks, a safe and fridge, 2 reclining deck chairs and 2 normal chairs, ceiling fans and WIFI for 2 devices.. Was disappointed some of the water rides were closed, so early after opening for maintenance.",4.0
4178,Kids love it,"There are enough rides n play for kids all ages(toddler to 10 yo). If your kids higher than 110cm, they can try all the thrill rides such as Project X n Dragon roller coaster. Beetle Jump quite fun for them,too. Boat rides(forgot the name) also a must to try. Bring sunhat, sunblock, raincoat n spare clothes for kids. They don't really check your bag at the entrance(when i was there), so u can bring along little snacks n water for your kids. The food inside park are standard, but you may also consider to eat just outside the entrance gate. Many selection there, from KFC to kopitiam. If your kid is a legomaniac, you should check out the shopping area. Legoland location is right next to legoland resort n water themepark.",3.0
4179,Very terrible experience,"Not attractive, less roof area (very very unreasonable hot) , very pricey (not worth the money), very confusing of accurate and reliable information, not accessible, the staffs are less trained to provide good service and accurate informationI won't suggest",1.0
4180,Very disappointing trip,"Hey guys! I had a very terrible experience in Legoland Malaysia. First the approach is not good. Second is that there is not much shelter. There are not much games or rides for kids. And always check the weather before booking your tickets or else all the rides will be closed. That's what happened with us. When we went to the water park they didn't allow us to enter. It started to rain heavily and we were drenched as that time all the shelters are packed with visitors. We lost 300 ringet ( malaysian currency ). Well my advice to you is that if you are staying in singapore, there are several swimming complex which is similar to the water park like jurong east swimming complex, CSC bukit batok etc. If you are a slide maniac then you can try to go to the water park. One of the most disappointing part was that we wasted 30 mins for the queue and just after 5 mins of the movie they stopped it and said it was a  technical problem. The attitude of the workers in legoland is bad. If you are searching for a i vegetarian option then you can find it in the merdini mall.",2.0

4184,Second times the charm,Our second visit and the park was reasonably quiet so we managed to do almost all the attractions we missed the first time with the afternoon to spare for the water park. The water park was good fun and we were fortunate to have great weather that day. ,4.0
4185,A kid‚Äôs haven,"Our family of three adults visited Legoland Malaysia on a Friday. As it was the school holidays, there were many children. Most of the rides were more for the children. For adults, other than the flume ride and the ‚ÄúProject X‚Äù there were not much of thrill rides.The Lego Kingdoms was closed as it rained when we were there, so we did not ride the Dragon roller coaster.The 4D show is just average, nothing to shout about. To get a bird‚Äôs eye view of the entire Legoland, do take a ride to The Observation Tower.The main attraction is the Miniland. It‚Äôs amazing to see the detailed miniatures of the famous landmarks. I loved the Tanah Lot in Bali as I have been there and it looked so real. Some of the miniatures like the Singapore Flyer and KL Twin Towers were lighted up in the evening.In the evening, before the Christmas Tree Light up, there were carolers who added Christmas cheers to the festive season.As a conclusion, if you are not there for the thrill rides, this is a place where you can spend a weekend with your family.",4.0
4186,Kids LOVE it,"Suitable for children 5-9 or even 10Both children were excited n loves all the rideseven those roller coaster techni X and the dragon(bigger one) they simply love iT.Prepare to get wet, bring lots of plain water. No outside food allow (conduct checks)After the park you might to go to city square to eat before heading back to Singapore.Strollers are available for rent , toilets are SUPER clean.Recommended whole day for the park trip, dun buy together with water park if the kids are going to ride every single one 1 full day is juz nice. At every theme, there will be a playground, therefore it really can tk up to a full day for kids especially if it's the 1st trip or so",3.0

This afternoon, we were at Legoland JB for the first time. At about 4pm ,we headed back to our car parked along the road. To our horror, the back rear window was shattered (totally SHATTERED) ! At first, we did not believe what we saw. We froze for a split seconds not knowing what to do. The car was ransacked. We lost a pair of golf shoes, some new AA batteries and my favorite snacks. Next, my mom went to the Park's security for help but was told that they could not help because the incident did not happen in their car park. Sometime later, dad decided to get back home as soon as possible to get the car repaired. Please do not LEAVE ANY VALUABLES in your car.",2.0
4188,Less games for kids,"The minimum height for children is 100cm which is stupid!!!my daughter is 95cm but they did not allow her to play.end up we only can play 4 games only!!!it doesn't worth it at all when i have to RM90 for child tickets. Safety is the main issue so provide more games or change your minimum height. Everland in Korea only ask for 80cm!!come on Legoland, do something!!",2.0
4189,legoland weekend,"some tips for enjoying legoland / water park1. Buy a 2 day combo ticket to complete the 2 parks. 1 day each. As its school holidays now, queues for the water slides and theme park rides can get along, average of 15 to 20 minutes wait per slide / ride.2. Skip legoland hotel and stay at anyone of the other hotels in the area until there are better reviews of the hotel ( you will then know things have improved )3. Change some extra ringgit and have your meals at the medini mall outside legoland, it has better variety and more value for money however closing times for the restaurants are rigid take note that the eateries serve their last customers at around 8ish and will not make an exception. Food in the park is limited variety but reasonable pricing.3. Restrooms are not the most pleasant use the restroom at the entry point if you arrive early (10 am) thats the cleanest you will ever see the restroom.  By the end of the day try to hold it if possible till yoy get to medini or back to your hotel. 4. Rides have enough thrill factor for kids 12 and below only. Expect no kicks for teenagers etc. Water park is okay and good fun for everyone but must be patient when queueing for slides. Rides like driving school / boating school have extremely long queues, either take these rides first ir last. The 4d shows are rotated every 25 minutes so if yoy time it right yoy can watch all of them at 1 go. Classes for kids at lego school get filled up pretty fast so go early sign up for a later class and enjoy the park first. Staff who man the rides are well trained, safety is a huge thing at the park. 5. Despite being a yr old the park still lacks shade ( trees take a long time to grow ) so please bring umbrella . sun block , cap to shield you from the merciless sun.6. The dino ride will get you soaking wet and the dryer (RM 10 ) a go is useless, buy the legoland poncho for use and keep it as a souvenior thereafter.7. Mini land is very nice at night as it gets lighted up , this offers a different perspective.8. Given favourable exchange rate for SGD, Lego in the Big shop is still very expensive and I would give it a miss.",4.0
4190,Great for small kids,"Have been to a few theme parks but have to say this is one of the best. Having 3 kids whose age are less than 12 years old, this is one of the places in which they really will have fun.Height restrictions were not much of a problem and the rides are catered for those below 12. Loved this park compared to Legoland Windsor as this one has 4 roller coaster rides. Queues were short and sweet but mind you we went on a school holiday weekday.Few negative points were the expensive food, which is probably expected and also the heat. Make sure you bring a hat and if needed some sun tan lotion. You can actually go out of the park for lunch and eat at the stores outside but this can only be done once. Did not do this but they said this was allowed.Try to come early so that your parking isn't far and also you won't have to line up long to buy tickets to get into the park. Ticketing starts at 9am whereas the park opens at 10am. You can buy online but you will miss out on offers that are available like kids go free or others which forces you to line up.Great fun for my kids but if you have teenage kids you would probably be better off going to Universal Studios Singapore. If yours are around my age, forget USS and enjoy here!!",5.0
4191,A normal theme park but it can be fun for the kids since they most probably played with lego one way or the other.,"Having been to other legoland, I must say legoland malaysia is not as good as the one like LA. But it is a good place to bring the kids whom are below age of 10. Caiton if you want to drive up to legoland from singapore, be prepared for a massive jam at the customs during school holidays. It doesn't matter whether it is tuas or woodlands customs . So get up early though the park opens at 10am and closes at about 6 to 8pm check their website as they may extent opening hours , take time to enjoy some malaysian breakfast before heading down. Toy R Us members have a 30% discount check with your local outlets for details. If you are not member ticket can be purchase at a tour agent WTS located at singapore flyer at a much cheaper price they also offer package that includes transportation and travel insurance. All this beat having to fork out RM140 for the ticket at the main entrance. I would suggest booking a hotel room at the newly open legoland hotel, take note the hotel rooms does not include entry to the theme parks I.e. legoland and water theme park. So find a tour agent to negotiate for a package deal. Since you will take a day to enjoy each theme park so a 2 day stay is suffice. Bring water which could be purchase at a rest stop along the way before going to the theme park, travel light, it going to be hot and humid. The snake bar u can forget about it.  Stroller is avalible for rent, but the price is......think twice..",3.0
4192,"Staff unhappy face , unhelpful , not friendly",Hi legoland please hire well trained staff and need to improve more in this situation to welcoming all your guest to bring the good memories back  and its very seriously ,5.0
4193,Good for kids,The park is not big and you can finish it in less than a day. The queue was ok except for the driving school which took us more than 45 mins. Staff was not that efficient and I think they could operate more smoothly to shorten the waiting time. Games were good for young kids but adults or older kids might find it boring.,4.0
4194,Great but plan carefully!!!,"Legoland,  a nice design concept for the kids who were overjoyed since they always playing with Lego blocks. Nice rides and themes. The Lego City was really unique experience for the younger kids. If you choose to do the water park and theme park then I would strongly recommend you do this separately or over two days. Staff are friendly but due to the peak season the crowds were big on all rides and activities. Waiting times really long. The negative aspect for me is the use of the Canbanas at the water park which  is poorly advertised and managed. The rules need to be more clear and management must institute a better program on how to hire and book these cabanas. The current method is just bad on how it is managed! Staff are friendly which is why I give it a four star rating. Plan your trip carefully to make maximum use of rides and facilities. ",4.0
4195,Excellent family trip with kids,"It's a excellent fun place for family with young kids. Your kids will have loads of fun as most games and activities are suitable for kids. But it's really hot as there are very little shelter and trees around. Too few of snack kiosk. The area is pretty big, best if there is a hop-on hop-off shuttle service around the park.",5.0
4196,Waterpark is a but a glorified themed water park,"I came to Legoland Waterpark expecting more than the usual water park rides but was suitably disappointed. There are only about 4-5 rides in total with some 6 slides for each ride. Definitely not recommend a 2nd trip unless coupled with the Legoland theme park cos both will occupy that 1 day planned (both rides can be disappointing as really it's more suited for kids less than 10). I was totally put off by the lack of service on the park ushers - forget about shopping at the main Lego store at the theme park unless you have purchased a separate pricey entrance ticket for the theme park (BTW it's separate from the entrance ticket that you pay for the waterpark) or the next best alternative offered? Put a deposit of RM140 which can only be redeemed with a minimum spend of RM100 per person!!! There is no other suitable sized lego store at the waterpark. Food-wise, it's definitely worse than the theme park with a pitiful sandwich stand that has lines that runs forever! Lockers are definitely pricey at RM20 for a small locker that opens and closes 1 time.",3.0
4197,Well organized but may not be that exciting,"Based on prior research on the net, Legoland was a surpise for me with its well organised theme park. I was really expecting a nightmare of a theme park.Traveled just after Xmas, and even during the peak holiday period, parking was a breeze and walking was just maybe 5 minutes i got to the entrance (I guess I was early arrived at 10am).Parking cost RM7 per entry. Reasonable.Purchase of my tickets took longer, it took more than 15 minutes to get my tickets and highly recommend those who are planning to go to purchase your tickets online instead of queuing.The attractions were nothing much of a WOW. Maybe because my child is only 5 and not interested in rides. Saw the queue of the rides and minimum wait is 15 mins at least for those rides in Lego CITY section. There were no stars, festivities neither shows that I can expect in a theme park, even the photographers do not seem excited.Food at the park is reasonable and bottled water is just RM3... totally great not a rip off like other Theme parks. Food is not great but acceptable.Other than that, interesting attraction but maybe once is enough.",3.0
4198,Water park & themed park,"I purchased the 2-day combo tickets online, which is cheaper compared to buying it at the entrance. This includes unlimited pass to both water and themed park for 2 days.We are blessed to witness the grand opening of the water park and first to experience what this place offers. The water park is not that big but it's full of Legos. There are shows and activities to hype the day. After the splashing actions at the water park, we headed to the theme park. It is just beside the water park. The weather is very humid at that time. We forgot to bring anything that will protect our skin from heat. The park is not that huge, you can finish it in a day. There are plenty of restos and food stalls anywhere. You can bring your own water inside but outside food is prohibited. We liked the 3D shows very much. According to my daughter, it's the best themed park, so far, for her. It is because most of the rides are for kids.",4.0
4199,Good for young kids.... time. slowed.,"Spent a whole day at Legoland with 2 kids. Here's the thing, go early, aim to reach there at opening time so you have less people and have time to go around. Time is slow there. so don't expect things to move too quickly. Walking pace also seem to slow down. maybe its the lack of shelter or background music or something... There was not much shelter in the park area although waiting areas for the rides were sheltered and had fans. I guess hope for a cloudy day and be prepared for any weather. Hats & sunglasses and cool water were great; we also brought along an umbrella and disposable ponchos which we used in the evening when there was a downpour. Most rides are much slower than theme parks such as disneyland or universal studios... well except the 3 rollercoasters and the carousel (which is a very fast carousel). Which are great for young kids. Most kids above 5 yrs old should be able to go on all rides. Some rides need 110m minimum height to ride with parents. The kids had fun at the driving school but expect ques to move slowly here - even though we went on a slow day with not much crowd, my daughter waited at least half hour for the ride. Aqua racers was quite fun. We enjoyed the 4D movies. these were good and they screen throughout the day. Each show is about 20-25 min in airconditioned comfort!!! :) Duplo area is great for little ones as the whole place is sheltered. There're 2 areas that have lego building, one is a robot workshop (for above 8 yr olds) at lego technic and Build and Test at lego imagination. also airconditioned so a good place to take a break. but if you already have legos at home to build with and you don't need to take cover, i think you can skip the build and test area. Legoland entry is RM140 for adults, RM110 for kids. If you book online a week in advance, you can get 20% off. Look out for discount coupons online or in certain shops. We had a 30% supermarket discount coupon and previously we saw a discount coupon on Kellogg's breakfast cereal boxes. We went in mid-December, bought 4 tickets at the ticketing counter, and the cashier gave us 4 free return tickets for Jan 2014. I guess that's a good deal? Lego sets and merchandise are not cheaper in Legoland unless they are on sale. We got a small pack of lego that made a chinook for RM10. Legoland mug was RM19 + 30% off. Legofriends for girls were quite pricey. These made good Christmas pressies. I thought Legoland T-shirts were overpriced at RM49. If its raining and you didn't bring ponchos, they sell Legoland Ponchos for RM12. Photo captures for rollercoaster rides are NOT cheap, they went for RM50 (i thought that was too much). Driving school comes with a photo that you can view to make a driver's licence, this went for RM35 each. So be prepared. if you're going with little kids, you have to set their expectations right on goodies. maybe set a budget for souvenirs before you go and tell them that they can get something for RMXX or less.  Prices for food is quite reasonable. There are quite a few food outlets. Kids meals are RM15, it includes a main dish (chicken rice/chicken nuggets/chunky fish finger fillets/pizza) + ribena packet drink + 1 watermelon cup. Adult meals are RM22-25, they come with a main dish (fish & chips/signature roast chicken/pasta/pizza/burger) + soup + fountain drink. strangely, they don't sell dishes or sides separately. so when my kids wanted more fish finger fillets, i had to get the whole set, well at least ribena packet drink was easy to take out. Pizzas were only at pizza mania, and burgers only available at Jungle cafe.",4.0
4200,Quality time for your loved ones,"If you are extreme type and looking for some extreme activities, perhaps Legoland might not be the suitable one. However, it is definitely a great place to spend quality time with your loved ones. Most of the games are simple with just a little amount of thrills, but giving good impact for parent-child interaction. You can see a lot of kids are having good time here with their smiling faces. It was so touching especially when I saw a young couple bringing their old parents to have fun in Legoland. Perhaps, Legoland is not solely for kids but for you and your loved ones.",3.0
4201,Great Fun for the Entire Family,"The Legoland attractions are especially suited for kids and young teens, not too scary but with just the right amount of thrills.The miniature landmarks made with Lego bricks showcase the painstaking effort put in to build the models in such great detail.

4202,Once is enough!,"We bought our package of transfer including entry to Lego land from WTS Travel.

Today, 23rd Dec 2014, the clearance at singapore immigration took good two hours! Some of us got through earlier and out of three WTS buses which travelled together no arrangement was made to group those cleared customs back first. The organising office close at 1730 and no one to take emergency calls to handle matters! Our booked timing for departure was 0900 this morning but none of the 0830 passengers left yet!!Lego land theme park and water park was a disappointment. Please wear your slippers all the time as the ladies bathroom floor and hygiene sent goosebumps up your neck. The small lockers cost RM$20 to rent at the waterpark. There was only 1 cafeteria in the waterpark so feed yourselves before going in. The tickets are not cheap either costing myr$105 per adult. And the crowd was terrible on a school holiday Monday. The once in a lifetime experience is good enough to go bring my kids. Unless the bathroom facilities and hygiene improved we will not go ",3.0

What is really impressive are the lego models and the city they have built with models such as the Twin Towers etc.The park is very hot when sunny and it can get tiring quick as there is not that much cover from the sun.Prices for food and drink in the park are expensive as you would expect but its better to come out of the park and walk for 1 minute to the Medini Mall and feed and water yourself there and then go back into the park.Is the price of entry worth it?

We were offered free soda and either cup fruit or soup for each meal.The price is okay for us. Some rides and sports where new for us.It rained from 5pm onwards and all out door rides and activities have to stop.The Service staff were kind to help us call a cab but were unsuccessful.We were fortunate to catch a Taxi at the Taxi stand. We traveled to 2nd Link Customs.",3.0
4213,Very good,"We went to Legoland on Dec 11, 2013 , so its not high season yet. it was great, not too crowded, and we can get all the rides we want until we satisfy. I not yet try the water park because we didn't plan for it. Overall its a good theme park.",4.0
4214,Good for families with young children,"We took our two boys (4 & 6) to Legoland and they really enjoyed it.  I think this is about the right age for the park - over 12 and it is perhaps not interesting enough for the kids.  We travelled from Singapore for the day.  We ended up with a private vehicle which was quite expensive at SGD 250 for return trip - although this allowed us the luxury of setting our own times.  I was also told there is a bus which will take you there and back but that you need to book at least a week in advance in peak times.You should also allow at least 90 minutes for the travel (one way).  We were told an hour was enough, but it took a long time to get through the border, both ways, and queues were very long.  I agree with some of the reviewers that it was very hot by the afternoon.  Given the park is still relatively new perhaps this will improve once more trees etc grow up to provide more shade.  We found the staff very friendly and engaged with the kids.  While not at the same standard as Disneyland - if your children love Lego, I think they'll love it!",4.0
4215,Some Improvements Needed,"Just went there on 16 December and was our second visit.The variety of food provided can be improved.  Currently, food choices are limited.The place is hot and sunny.  Not enough trees and shelters provided.But generally this is a good place to bring your kids to for a whole of fun and adventure.",4.0
4216,One day is not enough,"It was our first family trip to Legoland Malaysia. We decided to make an annual pass. We reckon that we will be back again as the park was rather huge. We managed to take only 5-6 rides on our day there as the weather was really too hot.What we don't like about this place is that it gets very hot was the park do not have so much shelter. It can get very dehydrating to take rides under the scorching hot sun. After lunch, we were just too tired to continue with the rides as it was too hot.We managed to have a few rides in Project X and The Dragon. Subsequently, the queue was too long.Overall, it was a great day, but we didn't manage to cover all of it. We will be heading back to try other rides. It was worth the trip though. There isn't too many theme parks in this region.",4.0
4217,Fun in the scorching heat (just avoid the yucky bathrooms),"I traveled with my husband and twin boys (2,5 y/o at the time) and my extended family (parents, sister, cousins, nieces (6 & 1 y/o). We arrived around 11am and at that time it was already pretty uncomfortably hot and humid, but we marched along. Our first stop after entering the park was the bathroom, and both the men's and ladies' rooms nearest to the entrance were already dirty, as in toilet papers strewn across the wet floor and many dirty shoe prints on the wet floor, and I didn't see any attendant (cleaner) around. Mind you, this was just 1 hour after the park opened that day.As we toured the park we found most of the rides to be suitable for children 3 years and older (probably up to 13 years). My cousins, sister and I went on some of their 'thrill' rides while the tots were napping. I'd say the were 'good, clean fun'. When it was time for lunch, we decided to head to Knight's Feast as we were in the area. I remember they have fried chicken and chicken nuggets, both served with french fries. It was ok, nothing special, just as I've learned of what to expect from theme park food except at Disney Parks. I'm sure this spot serves other meals, I just can't remember what.After lunch the heat was just to unbearable for us to enjoy the park. Luckily, we came upon a covered toddler playground that has DUPLO Express (a train ride that my twins loved) in it, so we let the kids explore and we could chill for a bit.Around 2pm we were all so ready to head back to the park entrance to wait for our cars to take us back to Singapore.I went to another bathroom on our way to the park entrance (not the same one I went into earlier), and it was absolutely disgusting.Hopefully they have that issue under control now. Another thing that comes to mind is why in on Earth did they built this place in this location??? Did they not think about the uncomfortable weather that occurs in this area for a great part of the year?Otherwise, the park is a good option to visit for families with kids 13 years and younger.",3.0
4218,"Very small park, not friendly staffs, not worth the money!","The visit to the park with my husband and my 2 toddlers was a poor experience.We stayed in Legoland Hotel which was located next to the entrance of the park.The park was very small compared to Hong Kong Disneyland and Singapore Universal Studio. The staffs there majority were unfriendly and always showed unhappy faces except for a few who stationed in Little Driving School and Fire Engine. The rest showed no respect to their work at all. Too crowded during our visit on Wednesday and Thursday. Not many chairs to sit and rest. The size of the park could be a plus to visitors like us with small children as the rides were so near to each other that we no need to walk too far away. But it was also the negative to the park as it seemed to be over-crowded.Not sufficient staff working to look after the queues or proper space especially for strollers like what they have in Disneyland and Universal Studio.My children favourite rides were driving school (there were two, one was for below 5 and the other one was for 6 to 12 years old), fire engine, X-treme roller coaster and 4D Chima movie.The food served in the Pizza Mania restaurant was very expansive. A small personal pizza and a cup of soft drink, a set of child portion spaghetti served with plain cream soup and a pack of ribena cost us RM60+. The ventilation of the restaurant was so bad that cause difficulty in breathing.One thing I would like to highlight that the entrance fee paid not the only money you need to spend in the park. There were many fun fair type stalls in the park that you have to pay to play to get some stuff plush toys home as rewards. Ticket of RM225 per adult per 2 day combo ticket and RM185 per child per 2 day combo ticket were totally not worth for money at all!I suggest you to spend a little more to travel across the bridge to Universal Studio Singapore for better experience.At least they have smiley faces and better atmosphere there.",2.0
4219,Very safe  but not worth the money,"The place just like any other resorts with water and dry park . we booked via online for 2 days  and was there beginning of this week .Their water park is very limited and small area . not many activities as being advertised as most the attractions indicated are actually is about one subject example slides have a few features . the beach with wave is quite small .Very good Lifeguards and systematic so very safe .The dry parks has many miniature models of famous monuments or buildings in the world . they looked really nice for example the Great Wall of China , Taj Mahal . The view of Johor town etc were all replicated using Lego .Play areas for childen are also quite limited . there is aplace where children are allowed to drive cars adnd issued driving licence but we have to pay RM 25 to get the driving licence with the photo attached  .So called junior licence .Food at the park is quite expensive  but the Medini Mall has good selection of food  . The locker facilities are there near the changing rooms . it is priced at RM 20 for smaller lockers and RM 40 for bigger lockers . It was quite safe .Overall it was a good experience of Legoland . we are able to compare with the other theme parks  in Malaysia . It was subject of  interest as it has intrernational brand",3.0
4220,Legoland,"My husband and I went to Legoland ,just wonderful  you can spend a whole day there so much to see and the rides are free for the kids plenty of places to get something to eat and drink.You must take a camera the size of some of the structures is quite big,Plenty of shops for the lego collectors. just brilliant.",5.0
4221,Excellent Theme Park!,"I went with my family during school holiday, but on a weekday. Not many people at that time, so my kids took the Dragon coaster for 12 times! There were even times when the guy let us ride 3 times in a row! Other rides were equally fun too. And the small kids had so much fun building cars and buildings at the Imagination section. The toilets located at the Lego Kingdoms were exceptionally clean. The food served there were also good (plus, the price is reasonable after you use the food voucher that you received when buying the entrance tickets). We didn't get the chance to experience the water park as we only have one day to spend in Johor, so that will be our next crusade. Spending one whole day at Legoland is worth it. The place has 2 suraus for the Muslims (clean and roomy), so there's no reason rushing your time to get out of the place to perform your prayers. All my kids (aged 5 to 15 years old), including me and my hubby, enjoyed our time tremendously. :)",5.0
4222,Customer Svc: thumbs down.,"We booked our stay from 8-10 Dec via the hotel website incl pick up svc to & back to Spore. We got cfm calls prior to departure that hotel cars are to pick us up at 8 am but they never came. Not a single call to let us know why. We had to make repeated calls to.the hotel & they could not tell us what happened to the cars!  We eventually decided to make our way to the hotel 1.5 hrs later lugging our lugguage and young kids in tow crossing the checkpoint.  Upon checking in, we had to repeat our unfortunate circumstances twice to hotel reception , still without any explanation why the trpt did not turn up. We got to know that legoland hotel engages outside parties to ferry its hotel guests and they have difficulty tracking down the assigned jobs whose drivers failed to turn up. This experience really dampens our holiday mood. Not only it caused us much distress and inconvenience,  we were appalled by the service standards of an established name LEGOLAND. Offers from the hotel to charge us half price for the return leg was turned down as it's not just my family who's affected but my travel companion's family as well. We chose the cheaper way to return to Spore. Waterpark staff are not trained to fairly handle situations. We were queuing at one of the play area for approx 15 mins only to be told suddenly that the ride is closed as quote: there is something wrong w the water. We questioned the lifeguard on duty what could be wrong w the water? They allowed a couple to get on the last ride n refuse the rest in queue. No effort was made to stop.the queue from the back which was the rightful thing to do till a Caucasian senior staff came to give the go ahead to let those who are in the queue to finish the ride. This has nothing to do with technical fault. My question is, why do water treatment in the middle of the day?  There are more incidents to highlight but I guess as long as you dont take hotel trpt.. the stay should be fine. Quality of staff is very important for a themepark. DISNEY HK has done a good job if I were to compare. No need annual pass. Once is enough. ",3.0
4223,"Worth the trip, especially if you have young children","Legoland itself was a good theme park for young children. Quite a few rides for smaller kids. Some queue times were grossly under estimated, particularly for the Lego car rides. Staff didn't seem like they were very happy in general. Food was reasonably priced (we ate at the pizza place), though a little annoying that the only drinks available for kids was Ribena. All transactions can be made in Singapore dollars, but strangely they would only accept Singapore notes, not coins. Change would be given in Malaysian Ringgit. There wasn't a lot of shelter when it rained. Travelled with WTS, trip there was over 2 hours (mainly due to slow customs on the Singapore side), then driving past Legoland to drop off at Hello Kitty Land first. Return trip was much quicker, but you have to find your own way back to the hotel from the Singapore Flyer.",3.0
4224,You need more than a day to fully enjoy the park.,"Overall, the visit to Legoland was a fun one. However, you need more than a day to enjoy all the rides in the park. Thus, you might wish to consider buying the annual pass if travelling to Legoland is not much of a hassle for you.Weather: The weather is expected to be very hot. Thus, it is a must to put on sun-block, wear cap and carry lots of water with you.Parking: Plenty of parking lot. If you driving from Singapore to Legoland, please check that your GPS is loaded with the latest map as some of the roads did not reflect on my GPS.Entrance: If you booked your tickets online, please remember to bring along your passport for verification.Rides: Some of the rides have age or height restriction thus please plan your trip according to the age/height of your kids before visiting. E.g. I have a 2 years old boy and 4 years old girl. Thus, once we entered Legoland, my older child headed straight for the driving school while my younger one headed straight to boating school.Food: The food is not fantastic and it is not cheap either.",4.0
4225,Legoland 40+ games,"Like the 40 plus games at the dry Park, many features of  Legoland waterpark. Food is scarce and not many facilities. To find banks, grocceries, service car shop, etcyou have to go to nearest and most complete Township, The Bukit Indah township, luckily its only 7 min drive to Legoland Malaysia",5.0
4226,Enough for 1 day!,"Pros:- From Singapore: enough for 1 day, easy transportation- Enough covered activities if rain occurs- nice layoutCons:- a bit expensive without coupons- kids food choices are horrible (problem not only found here ;) only fried, high sugar, processed food...Our 2 kids were 4-5 years old",4.0
4227,Legoland Boleh!,"May rides are suitable and great for young kids. My family and I were there on Saturday and Sunday with a night stay in Legoland Hotel. It was surprising that I don't feel very crowd in the park even though I saw a long queue before the park opens. Most of the time, you could just join the rides very quickly or queue for a short 5 - 10 mins except for the self-driven car at the driving school which took about 15 - 20 mins in the queue. There are 4 shows in the 4D Studio which each show is about 15 mins. In certain time slots, you can queue for the next show immediately after the one you watched as the interval is about 10 mins apart. The park is not too huge and easy to navigate from one themed area to the other. Don't expect the food to be fantastic and cheap as compared to the local ones. The newly opened water park is great but probably not too suitable for family with very young children. You may take almost the whole day to really enjoy all the rides in the theme park. It will be a bit too rush to enjoy both parks in a single day since both end at 6.00 pm. It is probably more worth it to buy 2 day combo tickets for both parks. If you plan to visit the park 2 - 3 times in a year, it is probably useful to upgrade to an annual pass with a little top-up. There is a shopping mall next to the park where you can dine and shop at a reasonable price after your visit at Legoland.",4.0
4228,Good fun,"Admission is expensive.  More worth it to buy annual passes for us, to come a few more time.  Great for Lego fans.  After a while, it is not so fascinating for non-fans.  The rides are good for family fun.  Food prices are slightly above the norm. Only visited the theme park this time.  Can get rather warm during a sunny day.  Not too crowded on a weekday.  Do visit the website to check opening days to ensure the park is open.",4.0
4229,Kids in Lego,"I was here for treasure hunt organised by Nissan. I love the lego's which look so real like a statue. You need to spend the whole day here to enjoy each and every part of the legoland. I love the wonders of world which also designed with Lego's as well. Make sure you bring your own drinks, sunblock, cap as well as small towel! ",4.0
4230,No Santa at Legoland,"My family of five stayed two nights at the spanking new Legoland Hotel. It is a colourful, child-friendly and well-thought-out place adjoining the parks. Only downside was the buffet breakfast which was poor in selection and presentation. But what was most disappointing about our visit to the parks on Dec 3 was the persistent rain. Knowing the current rainy spell we started our day very early and were advised by the staff to begin with the wet park rides whose availability is dictated by the weather. My family had great fun doing most of the rides. After lunch at Market Restaurant we ventured out to the theme park. After two rounds on the thrilling The Dragon roller-coaster at Lego Kingdoms it started pouring and the ride was suspended. We took shelter by shopping and snacking at Knight's Feast. When the rain started to taper off just a bit we moved on to Imagination to catch a couple of 4D shows. As it was already 6.30pm we decided not to wait around like before (waiting is frustrating and tiring, need I say) and braved the rain to check out Miniland. Unfortunately, we couldn't take any photos or linger since we were getting drenched. So we darted off to the shop. The rain never stopped nor abated. By then we were too wet, too tired to even stay for the carolling and Christmas tree lighting ceremony (if it was even on). We were sorely disappointed at not being able to take pictures at the iconic Miniland and marvel at the wonderful detail that made up the whole set-up (my kids are absolute fans of those colourful little bricks). And it really wasn't cheap for a family outing at this gem in our own backyard; in all we spent RM1,140 just that day for the entrance passes, food, Lego sets, souvenirs, and locker and dryer use.The next day (Dec 4) we checked out of the hotel and after lunch at the adjacent Mall of Medini we headed for the ticketing windows. It was 2pm then and without a queue in sight, I approached one of the staff members. My intention: To ask for a brief 15 minutes' photo ops at the Miniland (and we would not take any rides). I offered to surrender my driver's licence to keep our side of the bargain. I know the company is not obligated to indulge us but I beseeched the guy to make an exception. I was determined and desperate to try, given our great disappointment at not being able to enjoy the visually arresting Miniland on our first visit. The Chinese lad who attended to me first queried the time we made it to the parks the day before and wanted to know what we had done. I recounted the day's events. And then he stated the obvious, that it isn't the company's policy to fulfil my request, and smugly asked what if everybody were to do the same. He didn't even bother to confer with his supervisors/superiors. At this point I was peeved at this lack of goodwill and desire to assist a genuine request. It was outright rejection from the start. I also told him when we were in Hong Kong Disneyland, on the day of our visit a show we had wanted to watch wasn't on. We went back there the next day and pleaded to the staff to just let us in to catch the show. The customer service staff did not reject us right away but promptly disappeared into an office. Guess what? She came back with good news; we got our wish. (I must add we indeed did not abuse the goodwill and only stayed for the performance.) We were so grateful and delighted that on the last free day of our HK stay we made it back to the ""happiest place on earth"" ‚Äì and paid for our entrance of course. Whenever we are asked about Hong Kong Disneyland, we instantly give the thumbs-up. In customer relations, a little goes a long, long way.Later, I had to laugh at the irony of my encounter with the Legoland ticketing employee: He was proudly wearing Santa's hat yet he acted like Scrooge.",3.0
4231,"Ok place to visit, once is enough","We were there on a Friday, within the peak school holiday season of both Malaysia and Singapore. Surprisingly, there was no crowd. We were ahead of the queue for most rides. Typically the wait is 5-10 minutes per ride. In the afternoon, we could even walk straight into the ride without any queue. The only ride that took more than 30 minutes wait was the self driven car for the older kids.Without the queues, we finished doing all the rides within a day, and some rides we did multiple times. Some of the rides are not properly maintained, lasers guns does not work anymore, or even the steering for the jet ski alike ride. Food wise, pricing is comparable to other theme parks. In fact, we spent less on food at legoland than what we typically spent on a trip to the theme park in Singapore,As for parking, if you are early, park at the mall next to legoland instead. It cost just RM1 for a day of parking, and the mall is actually connected to the park entrance. Good place to dine after visiting the park too.Very easy to drive there from Tuas link. Follow the signs to legoland and will reach within 10minutes after clearing customs.",3.0
4232,Nice park,"The Park is very suitable if you have kids with you. The lego structures are so beautifully done, very interesting both for adult and kids. The food is expensive , but I believe that is natural. It is a very hot place so you should bring an umbrella if you go there. All in all, it is a very nice place to visit.",4.0
4233,Great for kids,My children (7 and 9) had a great time at the park. I personally am not into rides but it was fun watching my children enjoy themselves.  There is a driving school for kids but the wait was a bit long. They enter in batches of 16 and parents are not allowed in the queue. There is a 4d studio showing 'The Legend of Chima'. Be prepared to be rained on. My personal favorite was the free play lego blocks. Guests can sign out wheels and build cars. They have two ramps with timers to test out how fast the cars can go. There are also 'earthquake tables' where participants can test out if their buildings can withstand earthquakes. It was an enjoyable day.,4.0
4234,Still Room For Improvements,"To begin with the entrance fees are really expensive and it would have been a great start if ticketing staff are better trained in handling situations. Long queue when we were there mainly because a lot of people were 'bargaining' to enter without a printout of vouchers/coupons. Legoland has promoted the place, partnering with Toys R'Us and other merchants throughout Malaysia, however there were never proper instructions on how patrons can leverage on these partner promotions. We presented our Toys R'Us card only to be told that we need to go to their website and print out a voucher to be presented along with our card! When we tried to find out more, we were asked to proceed to another counter where the queue was longer cuz everybody else faced the same problem like we did with other merchants or tie-up programs. Ticketing staffs were unsure of what's going on and if some of the promotions/vouchers presented were valid. The entire theme park is nice and it caters to both children and adults - everybody will have their fair share of things to do and see and some are really interesting. The only thing lacking, seriously lacking in a theme park are smiles and happy faces from the staff and crew! It feels as though all of them were held gun-pointed to work there for free and that their job s**ks.Another downside is the eatery place. We were at the Pizza restaurant (self service) and were shocked to see flies (a dozen maybe?) in the pizza making area (glass panel kitchen) and after getting our food, we were having a hard time looking for a table that is clean or has been cleared out of dirty plates. The floor is filled with food particles and hand basin clogged!! And the sad part is, restaurant staffs were walking and fooling around with one another and laughing out loud instead of doing their job.The water theme park is still under construction when we were there. Tips : Bring water, hat and pack some snacks. Remember to visit Legoland website under promotions and read through partner promotions if you wish to leverage on that as ticketing staff will not be able to tell you much.",3.0
4235,ok only lah,"I've been holding off going to legoland so as to let them work out the operational kinks of the park. Finally decided to go last week with my kids with the current promo for both the theme park and the water park. The theme park is for young kids for 5 year olds and below. Most of the rides are so-so. My kids have a lot more fun at Universal Studios Singapore. I personally was bored very quickly. The water park was a lot better. My family enjoyed it a lot better. Most of the water park is designed for older children. I enjoyed it and would dare say, the water park is better than adventure cove water park in Sentosa. There lies the confusion. The theme park is too kidish for adults and older kids. The water park is too scary for the younger kids. On a positive note, the food wasn't too bad and there was variety all across the park. Prices are not cheap but they are cheaper than typical theme park food prices all over the world. Depending on traffic, and customs clearance, the drive was a relatively quick. Would I go back again? Probably not. I would just do a Resorts World Sentosa staycation and have a better time.",3.0
4236,Legoland Malaysia,"facilities are well-maintained. restaurants are really overpriced (which is understandable, you can get some food before entering, there's a mall just in front of legoland). miniland is amazing, some interactive features are not functioning though.overall, it's a fun visit (provided it's cloudy and not too crowded for rides!)",4.0
4237,Theme park could be better managed,"Park was relatively big and there were enough sights to take up a whole day. Only problem is the immensely hot weather of Malaysia.  Highly advisable to wear your sun block.  Also there were not enough covered shelters for the occasional showers.The first ride we took was the driving school. Signboard says a 15 mon wait but actual wait was 1 hr!  There was only 1 personnel manning the track and getting kids back on their driving track should they get stuck.  Another person would have sped things up a lot.The most exciting ride seems to be project x. However there were not much details on the rides and you couldn't guess what they were beforehand. Unfortunately, it was closed when we wanted to ride it because of the sudden shower. Water park is it's newest attraction and is well catered to all ages except that it's not very big. There was no clear signage of where the changing rooms were. Lockers cost a hefty RM 20 for a small one. Also, there isn't enough places for one to sit around and wait. Most of these places can't shelter you from the rain. We thought the water rides would resume as soon as the rain stopped but it was not to be.  There were no announcements to inform all why the rides were not resuming their services unless you ask one of the lifeguards. Turned out that there was still a lightning alert hence the closure.  But everyone queued and waited it out nevertheless.  Eventually it did resume.Both the wave pool n build your rafts have warm water and is comfortable. The rest are probably cold water rides.",4.0
4238,Lego Is Always Interesting Personally. . .,"I went to Lego Land Malaysia (Johor Bahru) just the two of us with my wife. We only went to the theme park (not to the water park). All the rides fee are already included within the theme park entrance fee. It has lots of miniature of famous building/landmark, architecture such as: Taj Mahal, Petronas Twin Tower, Star Wars, etc. They provide watch tower (free ride) for 5 minutes where we can see from about 50 m above the ground. Its best if you use sunblock since there's not much shade in the park.It has cafes, souvenir store, lego store, restaurants, locker and even hotel. We didn't stay in Lego Hotel but in Traders Hotel (managed by Shangri-La) about 5 minutes away from the hotel by taxi/shuttle bus. This hotel provide free shuttle. Be aware of expensive and luxury taxi around the are. If you want to go to further mall such as City Square you can catch a bus LM1 from Lego Land and it will cost only RM 4.5 per person. The bus also stop in front of Traders Hotel and Hello Kitty Town since this Hello Kitty town is only next door to Traders Hotel.Do online booking before you go, for 7 days prior to the visit you'll get 20% off and you dont have to queue at all. Goodluck. . .",4.0

4242,"Dull, kiddish, and very disappointing","Only worth it if you are bringing young children to the theme park as it is obvious that it is catered more for the kids. If you have been to Universal Studios, Legoland will be as interesting as watching reruns of old commercials. The rides constantly broke down and were sleep-inducing. They really need to work on having more shades and a cooling system because all of us were sweating all over just waiting for the rides. I went there before the water park was opened.",2.0
4243,Great for young kids!,"It was sunny and HOT so bring plenty of water and hats/sunblock with you! Most of the rides are suitable for kids 90cm-100cm and just a couple are for 120cm+ so young kids will he happy to have access to the majority of the park. The park isn't huge so it is doable in one day-- which is probably enough because the heat contributes to the exhaustion factor :) Little Lego stations distributed around the park are lots of fun and make sure you leave plenty of time for the gift shop. We booked a WTS tour that left from the Singapore Flyer as it was very convenient with lots of time slots, and the bus was quite comfortable. Make sure to pack your passports and possibly your hotel booking in Singapore just to avoid any mixups when re-entering Singapore. I would recommend it and go back again! ",4.0
4244,Its ok - could be better,"We live in Singapore and often takes our little one to Legoland for a long weekend.  We found it is quite a nice theme park.  There is enough things to do for parents as well as our little one.We usually drove over there and stayed at Traders JB. If you drive, you can get your parking validated on the way out. The water park is just open and although we have annual pass it doesn't really apply to that part of park.  We will have to additional pass.  A couple of negative things about this place is the parking.  It has lots of pot hole everywhere and it is only been opened less than 2 years.One thing we found is quite unusual is that when comes to changing our little one, dads are not allow into the changing room.  Then, it resulted us to get our little one change at the back of our car. We believe both parents should be able to do so.General cleanliness is a bit low and we found leaving prior to dusk, the place is full of mosquitoes.  It is a bit concern especially there are a lot of 'dengue' epidemic breakout in Malaysia and Singapore.There are a lot of restaurants in the vicinity of Legoland.  From dine-in or fast food. The price is pretty reasonable even dining-in.Overall, something we might think about again if we do want to renew our annual pass when the time comes.",3.0
4245,Kids will like it!!,"Adults may think is hot n boring. But kids will definitely like it. Especially the water park is just operated last months.

4246,"newly opened, can improve more","situated at nusajaya, about 15 minutes from tune hotel. entrance fee for non malaysian RM140, malaysian RM110. however, i entered readers digest's polls and got 35% discounts over the full rate - only paid RM91/person. in the park, most of the activities r suited for children or families. it shld be fun, but there is something lacking somewhre and i am not quiet sure what it is. probably, lack of fun music like other theme parks make the park look a little dull. it also lack of certain facilities - water dispensers, covered walkway which is very useful during rain. water dispensers r extremely important due to open space nature of the park, so we need to rehydrate ourselves more often. the best part for me - boating club (wish for bigger lake n sound effects) as well as the centrepiece - the miniland. it has intricate details of asia and proud of it! however, again it needs shelter to view so we r not exposed to direct sunlight or rain",4.0

4250,Excellent one day visit,"There are plenty of things to keep the family busy, we took our two children aged 4 and 7. We even had a few scary rides ourselves, the wife and I! Food is mediocre inside the park so would recommend coming out of the park for the restaurant options which are a stone throw away. Plenty of lockers options if you have luggage with you. Avoid taxis if you are heading back to Singapore via the causeway as they will be very expensive. Instead make sure you get on the last public bus which will cost you almost nothing to reach the city centre in under 90 minutes, inclusive of custom procedures. Try and visit the park when it is not the local school holidays or weekend though!",5.0
4251,Simply Awesome.,"I've been to the Pre-opening of their Water Park and it was irresistible.Be sure to bring extra clothes .Lockers are great help.There was a river pool, a zoo, and a lot of slides.It was so nice, at the end of the day you owe yourself a big sleep for those activities! :)",4.0
4252,For kids,"Since we travel with young kids, so we always go to theme park if there is in the city. Legoland is quite new and still have cons. Not to mention it's very hot. We bring umbrella around. But the kids have so much fun since most of the rides are suited for the kids. Plenty of restaurant choices. U can either eat in the park or outside the park which I think is more cheaper. Just get ur stamp at the entrance and return after ur meal. It's only one-time stamp n u cannot go out again. If u take the wet ride, it's really wet so prepare ur extra clothes. We have to skipped the ride since we don't have any extra clothes and the kids complained. The car park was also quite far since we drive and we just park on the road shoulder near to the main entrance. Luckily it's not school holidays and not weekend so, we're quite fortunate at that time.",4.0

They just mind their own business...waste of money neve going again,1.0
4254,start small with the rides - take the bigger rides as you built your confidence,"1) Its hot so bring your caps and sunglasses.

4255,"Heat is unbearable, thankfully water park is opened!","We chose the year end to explore Legoland as it is rainy season for Malaysia, and we were hoping for cloudy days during our visit that spread from Saturday to Monday!Despite the torrential rains in late afternoon / evenings, the heat was really unbearable prior to the rain. It is best if one could spend at least 2 days at Legoland, switching intermittently to the water park which provides the cool reprieve to Malaysia's hot and humid weather!We were at Legoland by 11am and by 2pm, the kids & adults all yearning to jump into the water! The waterpark is fairly small, particularly if you have attended those at Gold Coast before, 2-3 hours and you are pretty much done with most of the water rides.In term of poularity of the rides at Legoland, I would sum it up as follows:1. Driving school.Average queue time was 20-30 minutes during weekends, including the time to attend driving class before access to the vehicles. Limited to 6-13 years old, surprisingly even my 12 yo still enjoyed it. Do not despair when it rains, the rides will be cancelled but once the sky is cleared, or at least when there's no thunderstorm foreseeable, the staff will resume the rides again, even when it's near closing hour. Our kids went for at least 8 rounds of driving school when the rain stopped at 5.45pm, while closing time was 8pm during weekends.2. Project X roller coastalAverage queue time 5-15 minutes, this is probably one of the more exciting rides for the bigger kids. Our kids did at least 10x of this too!3. Aquazone Wave RacerAverage queue time 15-25 minutes as each racer can only accommodate 2 pax so the line moves slower. 4. Dragon rides at the Kingdom's castle (there is another smaller Dragon's Apprentice ride outdoor)During weekends there will be 2 carriages running compared with 1 during the weekdays, overall waiting time was about the same 5-15 minutes. It is worth to attend at least once as the ride drives past the castle and beautiful Lego setups in the castle.5. Adventure water ride at Dino islandBeware, you will be completely WET with this ride, there wasn't any queue when we were there. Best to ride with the swimwear!6. Boating schoolPretty long queue of 15-25 minutes wait time at the weekend, however our kids did not find it such a thrill at the boating school, perhaps the manoevre of the boats take some skill too.Off course pay a good visit to the Mini Land too, be amzed by the imagination with what Lego could do. If you are not rushing for time, stay to admire the Mini Land at night, it is quite breathtaking with all the lights up, a true masterpiece of Lego world!",5.0
4256,Excellent Fun !,"For those people who loved Lego, these places are a dream come true :) my only gripe is the rides on both theme parks are restricted to bigger kids ( 1.02 m and above ). Parents with infants/small kids will/might be disappointed.",5.0
4257,More suited to kids,"My partner and I went to legoland on a Tuesday, through WTS travel from Singapore. got a package for $60 SGD which included the theme park, water park and return bus trip.the bus trip there took about 2 hours, only because of the traffic out of Singapore and immigration/customs stops. the distance isn't actually that far.we went on a Tuesday and expected nobody to be there but seemed to be a Malaysian school day out so there was school kids everywhere. even so lines did not take very long.we did part of the theme park in the morning, then went over to the water park when it got a bit warmer and then back to finish off the theme park to end the day. both parks are well laid out, the theme park is about twice if not three times the size of the water park. we got a locker in the theme park next to the big shop and used it for the whole day. was easy enough to go back to it before and after we went to the water park and meant we didn't need to leave much more than a towel next to the pool.all the ""adult"" rides in the theme park were good, as was the tower that goes up so you can see the entire park and surrounds. the mini-land is just amazing, hard to believe it is all made out of lego. there are a few restaurants throughout the park, food quality and prices were as much as you can expect from a theme park if not better. if you don't want to eat there you can get a pass out to burger kind and KFC outside.the water park had an average number of slides and all are enjoyable but I think even children would be okay with all of them. the lazy river is a good concept, you can build lego on your tube, was pretty fun.in regards to the heat, I don't get why people complain about it. you're in Malaysia, heat is to be expected and there is nothing they can do about it!Overall its definitely more of a place for kids and probably not a place I would return to until I have kids to take with me but was definitely a good day out.",4.0
4258,The best family fun in Johor,"Having been here a number of times this year including the recently opened waterpark, the level of fun that i had was more than satisfactory. The legoland theme park itself is huge and the attractions are suitable for every age group. Overall, the most thrilling ride would be the first roller(technic) coaster near the entrance. I enjoyed the 4D movies as well which comes in something like 4 different show? Miniature cities made of lego blocks cover a large expanse of ground at the centre of the park and worth a stroll and photo session. There's also the dragon roller coaster  which sits atop a medieval castle. This is the longest and tallest of the rollercoasters but offers more of a comfortable windy ride more than the G's you would expect. Nevertheless, it is still fun. The water park by comparison, is more compact and I was able to derive a lot more fun and relaxation in a shorter amount of time. Chold above 107 cm are able to go on all attractions while those below that may be restricted on some. The highlight of the place would probably be the long lazy river which allows visitors to float and travel on inflatables on which large legoblocks could be mounted. As a rule of thumb, the higher the attraction, the more fun as you get more distance. If you expect to visit this place often, a premium pass(annual) is the way to go. It permits year round unlimited access to both dry and wet parks and also discounts on food 30% and 10% for other items n more. Actually, what impressed me is the high service quality exhibited by local malaysian staff which is becoming rare these days. They were helpful and pleasant at all times. I would say 95% of all staff i have encountered  were excellent. Being very critical of service attitude, I am certainly impressed.Now for the downside, pampered people like me could do without the heat. you could opt to go in the morning or evening but then again, most of the fun is in the open and subjected to inclement weather too. My suggestion: more shelter from the elements and Aircon especially where queues get long. Go on weekdays. avoid public holidays and weekends for shorter queues. Food is expensive and portions could be miserable or low quality in some restaurants for eg. Pizza restaurant. I would rather eat at the various reputable food outlets located outside the park. The food should be improved as afterall, this is the largest attraction south of Malaysia and introduces most tourists to malaysian food n culture. Walking distance to the carpark could be reduced. Actually, it is always a distance to walk even for disneyland or universal studios etc.... but in this day and age, carparks could have been nearer, and again the heat and rain are real things! Install a travelator? As for the waterpark, lockers a little too costly and i would prefer the key system to the electronic locker system which could be a hassle when there is technical problem or a queue.In summary, a must visit. Check weather, go on weekdays and allocate at least 3 hours.",4.0
4259,Great theme park for toddler,"The Water Theme park was great even for adult like me as enjoy a lot with my kids as can played the games together.  We bought the combo ticket.  Spend 2 hrs in water park first as it's not so hot in the morning and less visitors hence no queue needed.  Then proceed to the Theme park and bit disappointing as an adult but my 8 year old are having lots of fun.  Prepare to put on the raincoat if u r riding the adventure park water craft as it will wet u terribly, I mean seriously wet until your underpants and shoes :(. Otherwise still a great theme park to spend time with your kids.",4.0
4260,Legoland Malaysia,Kids 11 & 9 had a great day lines were around 20/30 mins on a Saturday.  Rides to suit all ages of kids Roller Coasters to small children rides.  Kids did them all.  Pack a umbrella can be unpredictable.  Lego buildings are amazing.  Getting here from Singapore was the hardest part.  We hadn't prebooked anything and our Hotel told us just to go to Singapore Flyer before 8am to get the bus.  WE did and found out because we hadn't pre-booked we would have to wait until there was an available seat which ended up being after 9.30.  We ended up going on a WTS  bus at $25 each return because we hadn't pre booked.  Remember you have to get off the bus to leave singapore get back on and then again to enter Malaysia took us 2 1/2 hours there and 2 hours home.,4.0
4261,Legoland Water Park Review,"This is my second visit (and review) of Legoland. My family and I visited the newly opened water park this time round. We chose a Monday morning arriving at 10am, leaving around 3pm. Here are some of my thoughts-Build-A-Raft River - you are supposed to design and build your own LEGO raft and float around the lazy river which is scattered with LEGO pieces. You can't really build much on the float and the kids' got bored very quickly, preferring to chuck the LEGO pieces around which does hurt.Joker Soaker - interactive playground which for me was the centrepiece of the park. Kids aged 4 and above should be able to play here with minimal supervision by parents (there are plenty of ""lifeguards"" around to keep watch)LEGO Wave Pool - very mild waves, my kids got bored quite quickly.Splash ""N"" Swirl - I got dizzy, the kids didn't seem to mindWave Rider - quite fun sliding down the blue (open) and green (closed) tubes. The green tube has tiny lights along the way helping give sense of direction and alleviate claustrophobiaRed Rush - Family tube slide was fun but the machine automating the ascent of the tubes was jamming quite frequently. Not a very good sign given the place is not even one month old.Slide Racer - Older kids will like this, younger ones will tire easily from climbing the stairs to the topCabana rental - We rented a cabana facing the Joker Soaker as our base. You get four chairs, a mini fridge with soft drinks and water, mounted ceiling fan, wifi access and two towels for RM300. Expensive, yes but I think the cabana will be well worth it if the park is crowded, especially during school holidays. We ordered snacks from the cabana and they will deliver it to you. I would rate the water park average at best if compared to Sunway Lagoon or Singapore's Adventure Cove. It feels like just a side attraction to the theme park but it is big enough to warrant a full day. We were done quite fast as there were not a lot of people during our visit (weekday, non-school holiday).",3.0
4262,"Good for kids, average for adults","If you have young children, this theme park will appeal to them more than adults. Bring sunscreen and umbrellas, as there's not much shade in the park.Overall, we had fun with the rides, but enjoyed taking pictures of major Asian landmarks made entirely out of Lego bricks.",3.0
4263,Better than expected.,"My kids, 11 and 3 years old, enjoyed Legoland more than Universal Studios Sentosa. The foid inside the park was costly (typical of theme parks). Good variety and reasonably priced food outside Legoland at Medini Mall. Get a stamp at the exit so you csn enter the park again at no cost. We asked a staff inside the park but were told not possible. Upon lezving at end of the day, the staff at the exit confirmed stamp was available. Good to know for future visits.",4.0
4264,Good for kids but beware of heat!,"This is an excellent place for kids aged 5 to 10 - yes, older ones would enjoy the park too but the rides are geared towards that age group. Younger tots are not left out - they have their own duplo play area and they can also go on most (but not all) rides. The cleanliness level and service standards are acceptable for the time that we were there. Downsides - some of the queues are ridiculously long and the heat will get to you eventually even with sunblock. Bring plenty of water, rest often. This is a relatively new park so the trees are still growing - do not expect sufficient shade till at least another year or so. There is a mall near the entrance of the park so for those who would not wish to eat at the park, just eat first (or later). I don't see why there is a need for some to whine about the prices when a little common sense will solve that problem.",4.0
4265,BEWARE OF THEFT!!!,"Lost an IPAD inside the Baby Care. The only place where they have security lock and guests staying must log in. Only noticed the IPAD was lost after leaving the Baby Care for no more than 15mins. The worse part is how they managed, or not even managed to give an effort to handle the situation. Upon talking to Customer Care, all they said was, it's the only place without CCTV, due to breastfeeding mothers. They can only check the place when the park closes. Due to their arrangement of transport, our schedule of departure was 5pm thru WTS bus. Of course, there's no way we can wait til the park closes! Left without a choice, they gave us a word they will reach us thru the mobile nos, email adds we left with them re feedback on their search of the area. Two weeks have passed, not a single word from them! Worst is, the baby care is a small place. When we came back, the same guests were inside. No one added. It would have been easy to search, the place or the people on-point. The only one that changed? The staff. It's a one-man staff area. The staff the time we left was different from the time we went back. They cant even tell me who the other lady assigned the time we left. ???",2.0
4266,Child loved it very much,"both my sons loved this park very much. most attractions is suitable for 5 - 12 yrs old child. you can stay at singapore & ride a bus from merlion at morning & back to singapore at afternoon. but we stayed at tune hotel for 2nights & bought Legoland tickets & shuttle service to legoland from hotel. this park is not interesting for teenager, i think :)",4.0
4267,Nice place.  But the heat ‚Ä¶!,"Flew in to Singapore and crossed the Straits to see this new theme park.  The gate presents a nice, colorful place to take them FB or Instagram pics.  And no one misses out on the opportunity.I had booked tickets on-line, and in advance.  But the only advantage of doing that is getting a 10% discount.  Everyone --- advance booking or not --- still had to fall in line in the ticket counters before going in.  Fortunately, the lines were short when we got there (if it had something to do with us going on a Tuesday, I wouldn‚Äôt know).The website tells you everything you need to know about the park, so you can plan your trip in advance.  I suggest, upon entering, that you turn right after the Big Shop, and walk towards the train station. Once there, take the train so you‚Äôd have an idea of how big the place is, and what parts youd like to spend more time on.Three things I noticed when we were there: First, some games/activities are rather pricey for what they offer (for example, 10MR for a basketball shot that allows you to win a stuffed toy), hence there were few guests biting.  Second, there doesn‚Äôt seem to be enough crew members. Im comparing with other theme parks, of course. The 4D cinema, for example, had crews that manned the entrance, but there was none in the cues on the sides to guide people in, or, more importantly, to tell people they shouldn‚Äôt stand behind the automatic doors (and there were a number who did; fortunately, before the doors opened other people pulled them back). Third, the heat.  It can get quite unbearable.  The sheds placed around some areas (along the sides of the Lego mini world, for instance) provide some relief, but the rather short operating times means youd probably not stay underneath them for longer than a few minutes.  Perhaps some Universal Studios-type overhangs would be a good idea?",3.0

Both day i also eat in burger king, is so nice and service is good. In the theme park there is a place for your kid to build the car, my kid can spend about 1 hour there. For the dry park just normal ride for adult, but for kid may be they love it. My visit both day also raining, but at the water park just continue playing because no thunder. Second day at the theme park also raining about 1 hour, so the kid can continue enjoy at the play ground.

Nevertheless, the park is definitely a paradise for children! Good to bring kids there for a day of fun!",4.0
4277,Good Enough but More Room for Improvement,"We went there last Oct 25 on a Friday. The ticket was booked thru a friend living in SG and I think the ticket costs 63SGD per pax which includes the bus  ride from Lavander MRT in SG to Johor Bahru & back. My impression of the place are as follows;1. Weather is too hot. The theme park doesn't really offer much shade either as the trees around it are not really big enough.2. The rides I think are more suited for little kids than for teens or adults. We were a party of 5, 4 adults & a teenager. I think the only rides we enjoyed were the roller coaster and the 4d theatre. The latter was a welcome ride as it was airconditioned so you practically cool yourself off. It was so refreshing that I was able to nap during the show. Hahah! There was also one water ride which is very similar to Enchanted Kingdom's Log Jam in PH. Only this one is a lot shorter and only one drop, but you'll still get wet.3. Ordering food at their cafeteria is confusing. They have separate queuing areas for ordering chicken, fish, & what-have-you. So if you want chicken, you have to know where to queue. In my case I wanted roasted chicken rice, so I lined where I knew the chicken queue is, when it was my turn, they redirected me to another queue as roasted chicken is different from the plain chicken! WTF?! I don't see the logic in this!4. If you're coming from SG, I believe it would be better if you couldbring some RM. Legoland accepts SGD but bills only, no coins.  So if you buy something in Legoland and you pay in SGD and you have change, they will give your change in RM. The exchange ratio is about 1SGD : 2 RM. I didn't have time to do the math in my head whenever I bought something so I just accepted whatever change I was given which somehow made me feel uneasy.5. Overall the park still has to reach its full potential. I think it only opened recently and it shows. Almost everything is still new. There's still a lot of empty spaces allotted for development within the park. Definitely more room for improvement.",3.0

4282,"Legoland is more for kids, unlike USS or Disney its for Everyone","This is something you guys have to know or expect when you go.It's just a normal theme park (made a big deal because it's in Malaysia - as usual - but with many missing elements.

Young adults may find your own thrill there but please adjust, it is nothing like USS or Six Flag per se.Water park is nice, but I see kids pee into the pool. Educate before you expose the children there, whichever nationality they are from or whether they are domestically raised.All in all, a good day out to see a new theme park. But thats about where I draw the line. Its a new experience but certainly nothing startling from rides to layout.Food is expensive and normal.Taxi is exorbidant.

4283,"Not so great ... Just average, can skip if you have teenagers (info on travel time)","I would say that more than half of the attractions/rides are suitable for smaller kids (below 10). We just chose the ones our teens will enjoy, which included the 2 roller coaster rides. The miniature world was okay. We booked the 9:00am trip through WT Travel. The bus left Singapore Flyer a little past 9am, we arrived at Legoland a little past 11am already. This was due to waiting time at Singapore immigration. There wasn't a lot of people (it was an off season, Oct. 28), but for some reason the bus line up was long and so was immigration processing time. At the Malaysian immigration, waiting and processing time was faster. So, Give an allowance of 2 hours +/- for travel time in the morning (don't know about peak seasons/holidays). Since we went there on an off season, there were no lines at the rides/attractions, so we went from one to the other pretty quickly. We also finished early. (It rained hard, so there were moments we just sat inside restaurants or went inside the shops).Travelling back to Singapore was faster, we booked the 5:15pm trip. Went to bus stop around 4:40pm, and just 5 minutes later, we boarded the bus, and it left around 5pm. We arrived at Singapore Flyer at 6:30pm (with a little of traffic along the highway).",3.0

The place is extremely hot so better to wear thin shirt and bring sun glasses, sunblock and umbrella. The conversion rate here 1SGD = 2.5MYR so better check if you can save exchanging your money in Singapore. Pizza family combo worth 58MYR including drinks and soup for 4 is a good option at ""Pizza Mania"" restaurant. We are very impressed with ""Miniland"" as they replicated common places in Asia. The place is enjoyble for both kids and adults. It would be good if they provide a lot of sheds and coolers to overcome the heat in the place. Services must be improved as some staff are inconsistent with the guidelines about the height limit in the rides and some are unfriendly in the snack bars.",4.0
4286,Great for kids,"We were looking forward to the recently opened water park in Legoland. Driving from Singapore via the second link was easy & fast. Paid 7.50 RM toll each way.  There was much constructions in this Iskander corridor. Only 10% of the ample Carpark was filled on a Tuesday afternoon. The water park was next to the theme park with its separate entrance. It cost 104RM per adult for a day's access. The showers and lockers were strategically located at the entrance/ exit. Small lockers cost 20RM for a full day with multiple opening. Showers were clean but some stalls already have damaged facilities. With inadequate signage of gender, we were just clothed when a lady came into the shower room! She thought it was unisex!The few rides were mostly placid and well suited for children. The tipping buckets, giant drums of torrents, sprays, jets, nets, slides and plenty of colours in the water playground was the highlight for me, an adult.Great park for children to spend a few hours in the sun (don't forget the sun screens or rash guards).",4.0
4287,Great Outdoor Theme Park,"My kid is a lego fan, he really had a great time and was so amazed with this theme park. Legoland Malaysia location is closer to Singapore than Kuala Lumpur, took approximately more than an hour of shuttle ride from Singapore. Queue to each ride does not take much time as there are ample seats in each, except for the Driving school. The mini land is huge and awesome, however, I wish they would provide a great view from the train that runs around it as walking under this open theme park can be really  exhausting, so put on some sunblock and bring umbrella as weather can be unpredictable. I would really recommend staying in the adjacent Legoland hotel as its proximity would be a great relief after a long day at the park, also, a mall is located just outside so options for eats are plenty.",4.0
4288,Water Park is super fun. Nothing Scary,"We had a chance to preview the Water Park and it was really fun albeit the Build a Raft River being closed that day.Although it boast to be the biggest Legoland WaterPark in the world, the size is nothing compared to other waterparks in Malaysia. It it adequate though. You get a whole day of fun for the entire family. There are slides for toddlers to grandparents. If you are a teen and looking for daredevil rides, sorry, there are none. Some do go pretty fast. Like all rides in Legoland, they are meant to trill, not scare the wits out of you. We like the fact that adults and children can go on the same slides. The staff are very diligent when it comes to safety practices. Enough lifeguards around too.There a few places to get your food but non catered to vegetarians except fries and onion rings. The kids combos are good value at RM15.There are lockers for rent. Small for RM20/day and Big for RM40/day. The shower area is big. However, to avoid congestion and standing in line for empty shower stalls, try to get changed before the closing time - if you can pry your kids away.",4.0
4289,More discounts for annual passholders,"The rides are pretty limited. Was it worth repetitive visit? Maybe not. If I were to rate the excitement level for adults like me, I would say 5/10. For annual passholders, you get to enjoy great discounts (40% for Lego products, 70% for clothes) for selected products and they rotate the items on sale every week. ",3.0
4290,Legoland Water Park,"We visited the Water Park on a Monday with our 6 year old and 18 mth old. My 6 year old found it immensely fun as he could go on all the rides (height limit for most rides is 1.07m) but the 18mth old was quite bored. The only suitable areas for him were the Wave Pool (the waves are very gentle and they provide toddler life jackets) and the small Splash Safari. Unfortunately the Build-A-Raft River was closed when we visited. The rides are meant for kids so don't expect adrenaline pumping excitement. There are even some slides that were proclaimed as 'lame' by my 6 year old. The Brick Blaster and Wave Rider rides were the most fun according to him. But take note that there are a couple of rides where you need to carry your own float/raft to the top of the stairs, and the raft for the Brick Blaster ride is very heavy, and the staff offer no help with the rafts, not even to help you get it out of the water at the end of the ride. I found this surprisingly unhelpful of them, since they were standing around at the bottom of the rides asking you to get out of the way quickly. There are small (RM20) and big lockers (RM40) for rent but note that you have to pay for the lockers via a machine that does NOT dispense any change. So make sure you have RM10 notes with you. Had lunch at the eatery beside the Wave Pool and the food was not very good - under-cooked burger patty, chicken drowning in BBQ sauce. You're better off packing your own sandwiches.   The road signs around Legoland and the parking signage are not clear so it was quite confusing actually finding the way to the car park. Currently only Zone 3 car park is open, and it's quite a walk from the car park to Legoland. We went in the morning and there were no queues for the rides, but the crowd comes in at lunch time. There's an early bird discount if you buy tickets online a week in advance.",3.0
4291,Day trip in Johor Bahru,"It took me around 1.5 hours to get from my Singapore hotel in the city area to Legoland. Fortunately, I had set off early. I reached the Legoland entrance close to 11am, 1 hour from the time it opened. It's quite a large theme park directly appealing to children, with safe rides and family friendly movies. Because I visited Legoland on a weekday, the queues were relatively short, and I managed to squeeze out some time to visit Hello Kitty Town and the Little Big Club, both located in the same building that is only a 10 minute drive from Legoland. Since I was already in Johor Bahru, I might as well visit all the places within the vicinity, right?After a day of fun, I enjoyed a seafood dinner while waiting for the massive traffic jam at the Singapore-Malaysia customs to clear. The food is very affordable!I reached my hotel at 10pm and went straight to bed to replenish my energy for another day of fun!",4.0
4292,OMG,"What a place!!!! This place is amazing, little kids to very big kids :-) all will enjoy. So much quality work has gone into this place to make a very enjoyable day. Loved every minute of it & I 100% recommend going. Well worth the money. You do need a full day to enjoy all.",5.0
4293,"Good for Kids, not Adults","I was a Lego fan as a kid & loved to put those blocks together but as an adult, Legoland didn't have any appeal, unlike Universal Studios or Disneyland (which has a diverse set of attractions for kids, teenagers & even adults).  The miniature Lego cities were nice but it was just a standard park as far as attractions went (similar rides to other parks but with Lego themes).There was also no interactive area to actually play with Lego blocks, which I found a bit odd, & many of the rides are designed only for young children (with a few for teenagers).  The scariest ride lasted 2 minutes & was only decent.  On a quiet day, you can go through all the rides in less than a day but I was told that during high season there would be long queues.There's very little shade &, although our guide informed us that the park was designed exactly like the 1 in Germany, the weather in Malaysia is humid so be prepared to sweat it out.",3.0
4294,Doesn't need whole day to explore..,"The place is quite far from everywhere with little options of transportation,  which is very inconvenient for foreign tourists. But it's fun inside, even when you're an adult and some of the attractions are for kids. The area isn't big so you don't need whole day to explore.Beware of the heat from the sun, it can be really bothering. ",4.0
4295,Great if not for the weather!,"We, two small families, arrived around 11am on a Saturday and were surprised to see very few people! Perhaps because it was very hot for the time of year in Malaysia... Many people carried umbrellas for shade. There was fun for everyone in the family until the skies opened up with torrential rain in the afternoon, that is... Will visit the park again when it is cooler sans the propspect of rain.",4.0
4296,very good!,"My kids like it very much, during our trip not many people in the park, no queing hassle and we really enjoyed our Family trip",5.0
4297,Great attraction but the location is not that convienient,"We visited Legoland Malaysia on a weekday during school term time and found it virtually empty, at least when compared to the other Legoland parks we have visited in the UK and California. The queues for the rides were almost non existent with the longest one being about 10 minuets. Some of the rides in the park are the same as in other Legolands, but the mini world is unique being themed on Malaysia and neighbouring countries which was nice to see.  At the time of our visit, the water park and the themed hotel were not open but the water park was due to open at the end of October 2013 with the hotel following next year. The theme park was clean and in good condition. We spent 7 hours in the park which, with the short queues, was just long enough to do the whole park without rushing. If you intend to visit the water park and the theme park together, a single day is not enough.My only criticism of the park is its location which isn't near anything (30km from Johor Bahru CBD and 50km from Singapore CBD). We travelled up from Singapore on a WTS coach tour which was very good but was almost a two hour coach ride which included having to go through both Singaporean and Malaysian immigration and customs.  We were picked up from our hotel at 8am for a 9:30 bus departure from the Singapore flyer.  Next time we will take a taxi from the hotel and have an extra hour in bed. From Legoland we travelled up to Kuala Lumpur by taking a plane from Senai Airport which is a 33km (approx) taxi ride from the park.All in all a great day out but expect a fair amount of travel at each end of the day. Since we visited the park on route from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur we had a considerable amount of luggage with us but the park had a moderate number of lockers of all sizes which easily accommodated everything we had. This may however be more of a problem at weekends when the park may be more crowded.",4.0
4298,Super fun!,Legoland  was only  a few month's old  when we visited  last April.  The kids  loved all the rides  and shopping lego.  The visit was truly worth it.   Wishing for more adult rides  and trees  as it is hot in Malaysia.,5.0
4299,Just remember your hat and sunscreen,"Yes it‚Äôs pretty hot. Yes it takes a bit of work to get there. Yes it seems to be in the middle of nowhere. But is it worth the effort ‚Äì yes! It‚Äôs enjoyable for kids and parents alike ‚Äì Lego is ageless!The Legoland website pretty much sums up what you get ‚Äì the rollercoasters and 4D ride amongst the better rides for adults but there‚Äôs also plenty of amazing displays and rides squarely aimed at kids. Not huge but the waterpark is scheduled to open about now, was being tested the day we visited, and should make this an even bigger and more enjoyable experience. The Lego themed hotel that overlooks the park is scheduled to open in 2014.There are plenty of food and snack options and the prices are reasonable and the quality good. Lots of cold water available at a very reasonable (for a theme park) MYR3 per bottle. Staff are generally  friendly and helpful especially if you know a few basic Malaysian words/phrases. And of course a wide range of Lego products to purchase ‚Äì prices not too different to home.We booked a day trip from Singapore for our visit with pickup and drop off at the Singapore Flyer. Neither the tour company‚Äôs website or staff provide much info so here‚Äôs a quick summary if you‚Äôre planning. Arrive about 30 mins before your booking to check-in/complete required forms (take a pen). Bus from Flyer to Singapore immigration point (about 45 mins). Exit bus and proceed through immigration. Return to bus for a short journey across the causeway to Malaysian immigration. Exit bus again and proceed through immigration. Return to bus for journey to Legoland (a further 15 mins). About 500m walk from bus stop to Legoland entry ‚Äì hurray! Return journey is basically the reverse although the entry into Singapore is a little slower due to customs check etc. Immigration stops took 10 to 15 mins each and it‚Äôs pretty much self-service/follow the leader with limited assistance from the tour staff especially on the Singapore side.",4.0
4300,Convenient place to enjoy Lego. (from SG),"We had our Singapore trip. We booked the WTS coach for our Legoland (LG) trip via easibook.com to sync with our flight schedule. We took the latest schedule of WTS going to LG, which was at 1130am, and the return bus at 815pm. We arrived at SG Flyer around 11am. We looked for the WTS Travel ticketing office to get our LG tickets. The travel time going to LG from SG Flyer was more or less 2 hours. The WTS coach left SG Flyer by 1145am. Mind you though, the immigrations that time both in SG and Johor (JB) had short queues, maybe because it was already in the later part of the morning, most of the LG guests arrive at JB around 9-10am. Please do not forget your passports and disembarkation forms as you‚Äôll be entering/leaving one country from another. We were at LG around 2pm. Malaysia‚Äôs weather is humid and sunny! Upon entrance, we tried to look for a map but one of the staff members there instead pointed us to the big map located at the center of the park. We were only able to get one from a photo booth. For adults like us, we just chose from the map what to ride in LG. Since Bee wanted to try the most ‚Äúdaring‚Äù ride there, we started with Project X: Technic. I‚Äôm not fond of rides. I don‚Äôt like the feel of drops. The only roller coaster that I like is the Space Mountain (in Disneyland). I have NEVER tried any ride with loops. However, Bee was acting like a stubborn kid and forced me to try all the rides that he wants. I was kind of preparing myself for these rides so I decided to go. My only rule is that I would not ride anything with a loop.Project X has no loop, but it has 2 drops: one big drop at the start and another one in the middle of the ride. The rest is more on sharp turns that would let you feel as if you‚Äôre gonna fall from the sides. I was able to ride this twice. We had this as our first and last ride.Next was the Dragon ride. There are 2 rides, one smaller than the other. At first we thought we were lining up for the bigger one. We just realized that we queued for the smaller one after the ride. Haha! The bigger one is more fun that the smaller one as it has drops and curves. Both rides have no loops so it was a good ride for me. We tried the bigger one for 5 times.The Observation Tower is not really a ride. It‚Äôs similar to the Sentosa or Ocean Park Tower where you could have a bird‚Äôs eye view of the vast Legoland. The tower has no aircon and it was hot up there! Right beside the tower is the 4D Movie and we had the LG Racer for viewing. It‚Äôs a typical 4D movie about Lego, so it‚Äôs something for the kids.It was time for my poncho. I hate log jams/rapids. I hate slow drops, since I could feel it more than fast ones. The water drags the ride, making it slower. So at first, I just looked after our bags while Bee rode the Dino Island Ride. It‚Äôs similar to our EK‚Äôs jungle log jam. However, since Boyfie wanted to try it again, he begged me to ride the second time. There are drying areas beside the ride for a fee. Lockers are available only beside the Project X: Technic but you could leave your things at the counters available in each ride. After, we had our shopping and dining inside the theme park. Cost of Lego toys there and here in the Philippines is pretty much the same. It‚Äôs just a matter of availability of what you wanted to buy. We just bought shirts after our water ride, few key chains and toys. After, we claimed our photos from the Big Shop with free soft copies of the photos online. Then we tried Dragon Ride for a few more times and the Project X for our last ride.During that time, the Water Park was on its soft opening but we were not able to enter the area. The Hotel was also not yet operational. Both will open this November.We left LG by past 7pm then had our dinner at Medini Mall, where we also had our lunch before going inside LG. There‚Äôs not much restaurants in that mall but a lot cheaper than LG. The Mall is just a few walks away from LG. Since we didn‚Äôt want to experiment with what we‚Äôre gonna eat, being hungry lions that we were, we just had Burger King for Lunch and KFC for dinner. We waited for the WTS coach at 8pm and left LG at around 815pm. We arrived at the SG Flyer around 930pm. By the way, there are no available money changer inside or near LG. Better bring enough ringgit. Though we hadn‚Äôt tried it, based on LG‚Äôs website, SGDs are acceptable there. My boyfie is a certified Lego addict and took us around 5 hours to scout the whole park so I guess one need not stay the whole day there just to enjoy the place.",3.0
4301,Exciting place in a super duper hot location,"We visited on weekday, where there is no long queue. It was very exciting where there are so many lego giant minifigures around! Some of the rides are quite exciting and recommend everyone to try such as:Dino Island, 4D studio, The Dragon. The Miniature Land was also very exciting, figuring the miniatures of various famous placs in the world. The only one thing need to be sort out is the hot temperature issue.",4.0
4302,Super hot but fun for the whole family!,"First legoland in asia and short hour ride from singapore makes it easy to visit.  Smaller legoland than both san diego and london. We chartered an alphard from maxicab ($340 round trip, expensive but worth it vs taking a bus) to take us there and bring us back home. Unfortunately, they will be opening their water park on Monday Oct 21st, two after our visit.  Looking forward to coming back another time to try out the water park and possibly the hotel if its opened.  The park doesnt have much shade and at the beginning the sun was beating down on us.  We were able to see and ride all the attractions and shop for lego in about 4-5hrs.  Most of the rides are designed for younger children  2-5 year olds.  The adults + older kids only have a few 10-20m high roller coasters to enjoy but are pretty good (Project X, Knights Feast).  We were lucky that these rides had short lines and were able to ride them 4 times each.  The food being sold are ok.  My wife ate none of the park food and luckily brought some fruit along with her to eat.  We tried to do all the attractions with lines first and then after visit miniland and other lego creations / experiences.Would definitely recommend bringing an umbrella, hats and sun screen.",3.0
4303,Hot!!,It just too hot.. Think need to plant more trees..The lego shop was nice and my sone shop alot there..The attractions just so so.. is all about lego no more or less..My disappointment is on the guest service staff.. SO DAMN RUDE.. We just cannot take it and if can we rathen choose other attraction other than legoland..,3.0
4304,Nice but Hot as hell,"the place is huge and attractive. however, the open land feels like inside of an oven. during m visit, i do not have the chance to ride the roller coaster as they shut it down temporarily. disappointed with that. the buttons near the exhibition are might get you wet as it squirts water right in your face and body. maybe they are trying to cool you down. but i'm not cool with that. Entrance fee was kind of expensive for a poor fag like me. souvenirs were also kinda pricey for me. But, i bought dozens of them thou. :P if you go there, make sure you bring an umbrella, sunglasses and you might need a disposable raincoat.",3.0
4305,A day full of Lego,Loved this park will be even better once the hotel and waterpark open at the end of Oct 2013.  The park is age appropriate and suitable for children,5.0
4306,Transportation is a struggle,"Legoland Malaysia is far from anything else in Johor Bahru. For this reason, getting out of there is more difficult and more expensive (about 5 times more) than getting there. Taxi drivers know that you have no other option but to hire them so they ask for premium price.   ",5.0
4307,"Good for kids and adult, but very hot","Even if the rides are really for smaller kids, Legoland is still worth a visit. Be amazed with all the Lego constructions particularly the MINILAND. You will surely appreciate the Lego replica of famous landmarks in Asia which took 3 years and more than 30 million Lego bricks to recreate. The entire MINILAND is animated and even the tiny cars move! Unlike what they did to Hong Kong Disneyland, this is not a poor version of Legoland so you will not be disappointed. The border crossing from Singapore is quick on a weekday so including Legoland in your Singapore vacation itinerary is quite convenient. My only problem with this place is the heat (we came from Auckland NZ where winter is just ending), definitely need more trees and shaded areas. Don't forget to bring sunscreen, sunglasses, cap/umbrella.I thought they will have similar policies with other theme parks but they do allow visitors to bring water and snacks. They accept Singapore dollars and the food inside the park is not very expensive. There is also a mall just outside the theme park for more dining options or go there just to escape the terrible heat for a while. I think it is also helpful to note that unless you are visiting with small children who will try most of the rides, you don't really need a whole day to explore the theme park.Will I visit again? Yes, but not very soon. Will give them a few more years to finish additional improvements and for their trees to grow. And although the place is nice and employees are polite, they are still far from the standards of Disneyland HK and Universal Studios in Singapore.",4.0
4308,Incredible lego but expected more!,"My kids are lego maniacs and they loved our trip.  I think the lego creations were incredible but I expected more rides, a bigger space and a much bigger presentation.  Maybe in a few years it will grow into that, but right now all I can say is it was average.",3.0
4309,fun!,"They say this place is only fun for kids. The truth is I was having much fun than them! This place bring out the inner kids of all of us. I'm really amazed with miniland, spending more time here than other places. the photographer of legoland was really helpful to help take photo for us. The ticket we bought was rm120 person, including a rm10 food voucher. The food voucher isn't enough to get you a meal as all the food sold inside the legoland are really expensive! Most of them are priced at rm20 & above. I personally think the ticket to legoland is quite expensive. It will be better if the price could be decreased. However, I do not regret as I really enjoy a lot. Tips: (1)Remember bring umbrealla & apply sunblock if you're going!          (2) Bring poncho or extra clothes too!",4.0
4310,Great time for young kids. Prepare for heat!,"Great for a 120cm tall 6 yr old. Under that and a lot of things would of not been available to him. I'm glad we didn't take our 2 year old. She would of just been bored and really hot.I bought a package through WTS travel. It included round trip fair and 2 legoland tickets from the Singapore flyer to Legoland.I thought the price was reasonable. The bus was clean and on time.Customs, although a hassel, was not a big deal. And it certainly has nothing to do with Legoland, but haven't done it now, i'm not afraid to do it again. Just bring your passport and employee/resident passes.Our coach departed at 8:30 and arrived a little before 10. This was perfect, as we were walking up, they had just started letting people in. I HIGHLY recommend getting there about this time. Nearly no lines for anything and it's cooler. Although it had been raining earlier so it might of been a bit of luck in that regard.The park was overall very well run and clean. The staff are friendly and helpful and say hello as you walk by.My 6 year old went bananas and enjoyed nearly all the rides and the playgrounds.His favorite was the driving school. Which I felt needed another employee to keep it running smoothly. The drive time was over, but disobident kids were still driving around being stupid while the other kids who listned had to wait and waste their time waiting for the other children to park. Another employee to help wrangle the kids would of been good.In another area you were able to make cars and race them down a track. This normally would of been fun, but it was a disaster. Despite clearly posted rules, kids just ran around doing whatever. Not taking turns, running on the track, push other kid's cars out of the way etc. The staff was not at all responsive or caring. A punk kid pushed my kid's car out of the racing lane, despite us having waited and clearly it was our turn. The first time i just let it go and we waited again. He tried to do it again immedietly after. So i smashed his car and threw the pieces on the floor. Please control your kids. It was choatic, and it shouldn't of been. This was the only part of the park where the staff weren't excellent, and probably the place where it needed it the most.There really needs to be more shady spots. The heat is quite oppresive. Thankfully cold treats and drinks are not outragiously expensive. At six flags in the states, a cold bottle of water or soda is going to be $4-$6 SGD. Here it was $2 SGD. The food was resonably priced as well.Overall a great trip. The water park is due to open a few days after we attended. We'll be back, and likely spend the night.",4.0
4311,Nice place - could do with more shades,"As with other Legoland overseas, the model structure of buildings, ports, airports, cartoon characters etc are breath taking - it is just amazing to see that these structures, which closely resembles the actual, are built from this tiny bricks of Lego. The kids would really love it - the adults would be enjoying as well.The only setback - it is too hot under the direct sunlight. Perhaps if more shades are erected with the fan that comes with the shower mist, it would be more pleasant for the visitors. These should be installed on the walkway - no need on the Lego structures. In the meantime, I would suggest those visiting to bring sun block, sunglasses, hat / cap and drink plenty of water - especially for the kids.",4.0
4312,New Water Park - preview for the privileged few,"As Annual Pass holders we were invited to a preview of the water park (due to be opened in a week's time at time of reviewing).  One of the attractions (Build a Raft) was not open.  I am not an expert on water parks so I cannot really compare it to others.  It was certainly a more relaxing experience than Legoland itself.  You tend to stay in one spot - as opposed to queuing for ages for a thrilling 5 second ride only to traipse off to queue for the next one.  Here you can spend quite a long time in the Wave Pool and parents sit (snooze) on a nearby chair in the shade.  All the attractions are pretty close to one another. Hopefully those with more water park experience will be able to judge more by my photos.  We have visited Legoland a few times with our annual pass so we only visited the Water Park this time.  I am guessing that (1) it will be more crowded once it is opened - and even more so once the hotel is ready for occupation; (2) it will be a good adjunct to Legoland however you will have to pay extra for an annual pass that gives you access to both Legoland and the Water Park. Only you will be able to gauge whether the math adds up for your family.  There seemed to be a lot of very vigilant lifeguards (with walkie talkies) around which was comforting.  The only shaded seating was by the Wave Pool though there are ""cabanas""  for hire i.e. little private covered marquee areas with seating and small drinks fridge. They are blue with white rooves - visible in some of the photos",4.0
4313,"First Legoland in Asia, no harm to try","overall is good place to visit with full of lego icon and theme. my concern is just the access to go there, the most easy way to visit is from Singapore but it is not really convenience due to heavy traffic at the border. I wish there is a direct subway or mrt from singapore to legoland like what Disneyland in Hong Kong did, way more convenience for the family traveller.i suggested traveller with family to take a cab from Singapore to JB (Johor Bahru) cost is SGD 60 fix, rather than take a public bus with carry a luggage and also stay 1 night is worth it regarding the distance. there is a bust station special for this destination together with the malaysian taxi simply ask the hotel receptionist to go there.",3.0
4314,For the Kids and Those Young at Heart,"It was cloudy when we visited LLM, so it wasn't as hot as we had expected. Still quite humid, but yay for no sunburn :-) It was really nice because it was workday and the place wasn't crowded. No long queues, no photobombings :-)We booked our tickets online and got discounts so instead of paying MYR 140 we only paid MYR 112. We went to Legoland by LM1 bus from JB Sentral. It costs MYR 4.50. Note: do not board the LM1 bus from Larkin. The bus starts its journey from JB Sentral, and most of the seats (if not all) are already taken by the time it arrives at Larkin. Well, unless you want to stand up for nearly an hour :-PWe love LLM! The place is filled with colours, imagination, artistry, creativity and of course, FUN! Since the place obviously aims for children, the rides are definitely not for thrill seekers. But the little ones can really spend the whole day here doing all sorts of fun activities. Driving lesson, boating school, building bricks, going on rides... It's fun fun fun! The ones who are young at heart would definitely enjoy some of the activities in LLM as well. My friends and I are in our 30s but we had a blast! There are other adults without children there as well, so no need to be ashamed to let your inner child out and have fun.We read from the online reviews that the food at LLM is overpriced and sort of tasteless. We had lunch at Knight Feast and proved it wrong! Well, at least to our taste anyway :-) Had a set meal of grilled chicken, french fries and Coke for MYR 20. The grilled chicken was absolutely delicious! We didn't expect that because normally when we go to a theme park the food is terrible and quite expensive. But this meal truly worth every ringgit :-)As awesome and amazing this new theme park is, there are some things they need to upgrade:a. The roller coaster-like rides such as The Dragon should have over-the-shoulders restraints as well, instead of only safety belts. Although the rides don't go upside down, the turns are quite extreme for the little ones. I'm rather petite, and although I actually quite enjoy riding roller coasters, I felt like I would be thrown off my seat every time The Dragon hit a corner and turned. The safety belt is safe, but over-the-shoulders restraints will surely increase the safety of children on these rides. b. They need more shaded areas where people can sit and rest. I can only imagine how tiresome it would be for the visitors on a sunny day!c. LLM should list the schedule of their 4D theatre on the map. We were late for the first show and we were told to come back after 45 minutes, but when we got there 40 minutes later the next show had already started so we had to wait again.Anyway, we did enjoy our trip to LLM. Looking forward for the Legoland Water Park!!",4.0
4315,A must visit place,We went to Legoland to celebrate my son's 5th birthday. We arrived on Tuesday at noon time and to my surprise there is only a few people enter the theme park. It is very hot that day so i carry my umbrella and my husband and our son are using their hot plus we applied a lot of sunscreen lotion for protection. It is quite a good place for small children. It was built for their age. Some of the rides my son cannot enter because of the height limit. A must see is the Legoland 4D movie. Overall our stay was ok. 4hours is enough for the rides and attraction. It is recommended for family.,4.0
4316,Amazing Legos & Sunburn Moment!,"It's my first time to visit Legoland Malaysia. We travelled from SG to MY, since it's a package that we've got from WTS Travel, going there via coach is not a problem. Travel time going there from SG Flyer is around 1.5 hrs due to immigration thingy. The place itself is nice, clean and amazing! If you really a fan of lego, this is a good place for you to visit. Figures made of Legos are nice, though Im not a fan of it, it just good to see it as well. But, during our travel there in Sep 24, it was extremely hot. So please dont forget to bring your umbrella, sunglasses and sunscreen protection. You'll get burn if you stay longer under the sun. Also, please note that the park is close every Wednesday, so select another day but of course during weekends, definitely there are a lot of people there. Roaming around legoland could be done in just half day, unless there are lot of people and queuing in rides would take you so much time. For food, there are some option inside the park but there are also option if you go out and beside Legoland you'll find shops and restaurants for dine in. Though, you can also bring your own snack there. Bring also extra shirts or clothes because riding in some activities will get you wet.",4.0
4317,Colorful!,"You'll be transported to your childhood when you visit this place. State of the art rides, colorful lego figures and friendly staff.Be sure to bring an umbrella since this place lacks of shades. Once you feel hot and sweaty, splash yourself on land of adventure's dino island http://www.legoland.com.my/en/Explore/Activities/Land-Of-Adventure/Dino-Island/  (its a good relief from heat) You can also bring an SPF water based to protect your skin. You can also go out of the park to dine for lunch. Outside you can dine at KFC, BURGER KING, Secret Recipe etc. Be sure to get stamped before you go out. Don't forget to buy your minifig keychain as a souvenir!",5.0
4318,Wonderful Day,"We were reminded of the Chevy Chase movie, National Lampoon's Vacation where the Griswold family travel to Walleyworld on our recent visit to Legoland in Malaysia, but we had a happy ending.  We travelled from Singapore and it took us 3 hours to get there.  We went via a bus tour company and if they were better organised it could have been a 1.5 to 2 hour trip. However they weren't and there was lots of starting and stopping and waiting before we even left Singapore which extended the trip.   So make sure you have electronic entertainment for your kids or they will go spare.  The trip home was better but still 2 hours because of the peak hour traffic.You have to go through Singapore and Malaysian customs which is no fun but just part of the adventure.  Don't forget to take your passportsWhen we arrived the car parks were empty (just like in the Chevy Chase film) and for a moment we thought the place was closed. But no, just empty.  We found we were in theme park heaven, an empty but fantastic theme park, no crowds, no queues, absolute bliss.Its a wonderful place and the rides were fun and suit a range of ages up to mid teens.  The lego models were wonderful.  I wished we had stayed overnight at the lego hotel and had 2 days to visit.  What a wonderful place and while it is still relatively undiscovered (and therefore un-crowded) a fantastic experience.  This wont last forever I am sure.It was clean, the food was good (for a theme park), and it was relatively inexpensive. Plus there were lots to buy which our son liked.Our only complaint was the lack of shade.  When you get hot go on the water rides and get wet, you will need to cool down. I am surprised they haven't rectified this. It will be even better when the water-park opens.   We actually hired a pram (with a shade) for our 6 year old because it was so hot and he got super tired.  It meant we didnt have a complaining child at the end of the day and we didnt have to carry him either. Plus the service was exceptional.  The staff were amazing and super helpful and responsiveI cannot recommend it more highly, even though its a hike to get there.",5.0
4319,Very good but hot,"Whole day spent there from singapore. It was stinking hot when we got there but rained after so it kept the temp down. Takes heaps of water and sunscreen as their isn't a great deal of shade. Went during week so lines to rides were ok. Food at the market cafe was pretty good actually. It's a long day coming from singapore, 60-90 mins one way trip, as u need to pass through singapore and Malaysia immigration. Kids loved it though.",4.0
4320,"Great for kids and BIG kids too""","Recenty we Travelled to Johor Bahrui to Legoland, we had a ball at this theme park. We got to the park on opening time at 10am on a quiet day, We were able to get on riddes all day without no Q's.. The dino ride was great  as its a water ride invest in taking extra dry clothes, but i didn't as it was a hot day.. The Technic ride was a hit with my kids as they rode it 5 each, couldnt get them off..The park is clean the staff very friendly and willing to help always.. definetly must to do in Johor Bahru...",4.0
4321,Family Fun,"We traveled on a day trip with our 10 and 12 yr old from Singapore (WTS travel) and loved it.   Like most rides in Singapore, these at Legoland Malayasia are fun but not for adrenaline seekers. The park is hot and there is shade with covered areas but trees are yet to grow high enough to have an impact.   You can cool down with a couple of water soaking rides. The water fun park is just about to open and looks like lots of fun.   If you feel like you or the kids would be too old for the rides you can check out Miniland.  These displays are amazing.  Hours of work and so much detail in every display from deck pools and people on the cruise ship to the Petronas Towers, Singapore Flyer, airport, temples and numerous other amazing displays.",5.0
4322,Great time,"Legoland was awesome for my son. Loads to do and our feet were sore at the end of the day. the Features and rides were great.Can't wait for the water slides and Hotel to open.Hot as, and the restaurants and gift shop were a welcoming relief.",4.0
4323,Perfect for kids under 10,"Excellent facilities and clean.  Our kids had a ball!  We went in a very quiet day and kids could ride round and round on the roller coasters.  The staff were very friendly.  Outside the park there are some shops and restaurants which was handy for dinner when we left.  Food choices inside were not that great but prices are very reasonable compared to Australia.  The worst part is getting there.  We stayed in Johor in what was reasonably rated hotel in Johor and it was the worst experience we've ever had.  I didn't feel safe in Johor either.  I would only stay in Singapore and I just think it us too much of a hike to get there. I will try the legoland hotel when it opens (I'd get a driver from Singapore to the hotel, do the theme park with kids and get driver to pick up to take straight back to Singapore).",4.0
4324,Something new and great,"One has to pass through the shopping mall before you reached the Legoland entrance. You can get some drinks and snacks at the convenience store. One thing for sure, is that they can do up the road of the carpark as there is some potholes. Went on a Monday morning at 11am, so the whole park was not crowded at well, for most of the rides, I only queue for 5 minutes the most. The rides are catered to the younger kids and not to the adults. One advise for the water flume ride at the Dino island, you may want to get extra clothing as you can get very wet after that. There are a few restaurants around the park, price is more a less the same, RM22 for a combo meal. Well, my 5 year old son did enjoyed himself and he wants to return to the place soon.",4.0
4325,Had a great time,"My family and I had annual passes so were able to come and go as we pleased which worked well as it was very hot on the first 2 days.  The park is modern and clean.  Lots of rides to choose from.  There weren't many visitors to the park 22-27 September so we were able to stay on each ride multiple times without lining up again.  Lots of food and drinks available throughout the park or there is a modern food mall just outside the entrance with the usual western franchises.  In total we spent 4 days in the park, never a boring moment, we came home with lots of lego and lots of great memories.  We'll certainly be back again next year.  If you've got teenage children you are probably better off going to Universal Studios in Singapore, but for my 8 year old this place rocked!",5.0
4326,Had loads of fun!,"We were amazed by all the structures constructed using little Lego bricks! We took so many photos, especially in the Miniland. Truly amazing although the weather was so hot! As we were there for only half a day, we didn't have time to try the rides. So we will have to return another day.",4.0
4327,Kids world indeed & little set back,"Indeed it's a kids world and most rides are mainly for kids above 100cm. I guess kids below 4 aren't applicable. The team should review the height limitation so that more kids could be allow in the Q. Overall the rides are fun especially my kids love the royal joust, boating school, driving school & junior. All rides entrance should clearly indicate the stroller area as I could see parent either trying to xZZAfter a year into operation, the trees are still not big enough to provide shade for all folks and the facilities requires regular clean up during closure time as I could see lego bricks are collecting dirt and dust. There were plenty of carts around to provide beverages and food portion were just right however the perceive value is kind of low. Fish & chips were soggy, probably holding time too long. Pizza was great and I enjoy them. Most rides were open and staff were pretty accommodating and welcoming from the entry. Hope to see what the water park could offer and hopefully it will be more welcome.",3.0
4328,Family themed park,"Nothing much I can say about the rides, except that its mostly for kids 5 to 12 years old? There were roller coasters but not much rides for adults. I guess only families with kids could appreciate the theme park more.But walking through the lego models displayed in the park, I'm very amazed with the details, the passion and the patience of the creators, especially the Pirate display. with sounds & actions, make the displays more interesting and makes you want to press every button. Very interactive.Can't wait for the wet park & hotel to open. Because I don't think I'll be going again till then.",3.0
4329,Legoland Malaysia,"We bought a package from AD Travel in Johor Bahru for a short holiday. Visited Legoland, Hello Kitty and Universal Studios Singapore. Stayed in Mutiara Hotel.

4330,Great entertainment!,Went to Legoland Malaysia with my friends and we had a lot of fun together playing the rides! Though the roller coasters was not that thrill enough but still very fun! The train tour ride was amazing. ,4.0

4332,"CHILD-LIKE WONDERS, BUT SCORCHING HOT","Legoland Malaysia is a bus-ride away from Singapore.  Travel companies offer services that include both transport and entrance fees.  The theme park is basically for children, maybe to the young-at-heart.  There are limited rides, but many constructed Lego masterpieces for appreciation.  There is an area, however, where Lego lovers can construst whatever structure they want -- Lego pieces of many shapes and colors  -- are readily available;  but they are not for taking out.  Lego construction sets are available at the very many souvenir shops within the park. On the minus side, they offer limited menu, few food stalls,  Worse, there is almost NO shaded area (aside from canteens) that guests carry umbrellas to protect themselves from direct sunlight.  I, for one, had freckles on both cheeks which I got from our one-day tour; marks that are still visiblle despite being there since two months ago.",4.0
4333,Legoland Malaysia from Singapore,We did a day trip tour by coach from Singapore to Legoland Malaysia. We loved Legoland but I would highly recommend paying the extra to get a taxi there and back from Singapore. Going on the coach tour takes quite a bit of time and even though it's cheaper I would rather spend the time in Legoland. I felt like we were rushed.,4.0
4334,Great day for kids,"We took our 5 year old son to Legoland.  We all had a ball.  The park is well done, good layout however you must take sunscreen and a hat as there is little shade and it is hot.  The rides are great. There is lots to do, the 4D Movie Theatre was excellent, the staff are friendly. There are lots of souvenirs to buy etc.  We stayed at the Traders Hotel who arranged a package deal for us to visit Legoland and Kittyland.  It was the most easy hassle free holiday.  We will be back to Legoland again in a year or 2.  We got a private car from Singapore and it took around 1 hour to get from Singapore to Jahor.  The hotel in Jahor Traders was far cheaper and nicer than the hotel we stayed in Singapore and next time we will go straight from the airport to Jahor as Singapore is overpriced and the service is not as good as what we got in Jahor.",5.0
4335,"Singapore to Legoland, WTS service sucks","Don't trust what WTS said: 45 minutes arrive Legoland. It took me 2 hours without any traffic jam.Following happened on me:1. Combined the shuttle to Hello Kitty Land with the one to Legoland. There were only 2 people going to Hello Kitty Land, while all other 3x passengers were going to Legoland. However the shuttle took the much longer trip to the Hello Kitty Land first. We by-passed the Legoland which was within sight distance. WTS just let all 3x passengers took extra half an hour for a favorite to that two customers. I agree to the combination for saving the oil but please go to Legoland first. Don't let >90% of the passengers waiting.2. Return trip was booked online more than a month ago. However the returning time could still change from 20:15 to 19:15 without informed by email. I just know what when I arrived the WTS at Singapore Flyer. Heard from the WTS employees that the 20:15 shuttle was still running. Seems WTS tried to pack all passengers to an earlier shuttle in order to free more space for more customers. BTW, Legoland is really good place to visit.",1.0
4336,Good for Lego fan,"if you or your children like Lego, you will like this place. It's suitable for young kids and Lego fan boy :) They have rides for young kids, kids, and adult. The theme park is quite big, and the weather was so hot. So don't forget to bring hats. We came from Singapore, and bought the tickets from Tune Hotel because it's incl. the shuttle to and from the hotel. We finished explore the park around 6pm and get back to the hotel for rest. But u can visit Legoland for day trip if u stay in SGP. We were not so lucky coz that day the haze (smoke) from the burned indonesian forrest was very thick, and most of the rides are outdoors.. so we didn't enjoy much our time in the park.",4.0
4337,It's a start,"It is a fun place to visit if you are below 12 years old and have never rode any awesome rides in your life. Ever.I love the lego miniatures, enjoyed the train ride. But other rides was a bit of a disappointment. Even the theme park from our neighbouring country is better.The taste of the food is just ok. But the price is expensive.There are plenty of choice for souvenirs but again the price is expensive. While I am aware that we receive tourist and it may not be pricey for them to pay, please remember the locals. It might be costly for them.",4.0
4338,Fun place for little kids,We spent 6 hours there yesterday.We took the tour up there.It was a very long process just to get there with 3 buses before getting to the Singapore Flyer and waiting more time to get out of Singapore.You have 2 checkpoints each way between Singapore-JBWe found Legoland to be wonderful.It really was for younger children than my 10 year old but he did have fun still.We all did. It was very hot! There is NOT enough shaded areas.We all got burnt.The hotel is due to open this year and the water park :),4.0
4339,Amazing Value,"This is the best value for money park for families with kids under 14 that we have ever been to. All rides are suitable and very kid friendly.The park is very well laid out and the new areas still to open will see us back in 2014 for a second visit. The staff were wonderful, informative and fantastic with the kids - and boy was there some kids.Wait time for rides was not long - we had an average of five minutes but no doubt this will change over time.Food was not overly expensive on site - but the food court outside the park caters to all needs if you wish to pass out.We had a fantastic day and will be back for more Lego fun next year.",5.0
4340,"Really nice place to visit, a bit expensive, no water/no shade!","Its a nice attraction, that is yet to come up (the trees are indeed too short for any shade). What is really stupid is that they dont let u bring in your food, but they charge 3RM for a 500ml bottle of water - I must've bought eight bottles for myself during the day. There is ZERO free water for anyone anywhere inside the park.The rides are good - you miss having a water park which is still in the premises. It would open by Nov but with an additional fee(over and above the 140RMfee!!). Thats a bit sore.You miss having theme/characters like Disney - aside from that its a pretty nice park with decent rides (but more kiddie, not hardcore heavy duty roller coasters). The lego sculptures and mini-city are awesome to behold. The general quality of all attractions is top notch.Beware of school holidays - your queue can be long, but when we went (Tuesday 19 Aug), queues were quite manageable.to sumup, -1 for missing water park inspite of high ticket,-1 for expensive water!",3.0
4341,kids will definitely enjoy!,"Kids love this theme park! I like that the rides are all child-friendly, its very safe and fun! Some areas are still under construction which, i think, would make it more interesting in the future. Downside is the fact that trees are still too young to provide shades and protect you from Mr. Sun... walking around the park can be extremely painful to the skin so bring an umbrella and put on some sunblock with SPF100!I love the miniland, think thats what I enjoyed most. looking at Angkor Wat, Grand Palace, Taj Mahal, Petronas Towers made of lego bricks. Amazing!Legoland is about 45min-1hour from Senai airport. You can go here via JPO2 bus (from the airport, fare is MYR4.8 or something), in the morning bus leaves the airport at 10am and stops over at Johor Premium Outlets for 5 minutes to get more passengers. You may ask Legoland staff for the bus schedule from Legoland to JPO and Senai Airport. If Im not mistake, the last trip is 5:45pm.",3.0
4342,hot but fun,It is crazy hot!!!!! They should have better planning in design. I almost died of heat stroke.  Nonetheless the kids enjoyed it. Queue is long over Malaysian and Singapore school hols. best to avoid visiting during then. ,4.0
4343,Best destination for Lego lover,"It is really amazing watching and playing with lego. I really love the city icon miniature that has been built using Lego bricks, such as Petronas twin tower and Singapore Merlion. The games and attractions here are good although most of them are more suitable for my Children. However, the place is quite far from city and a bit difficult to get transportation unless we ask for car rental to drop off and pick up. In addition, the weather is unpredictable as well, the other visitor who come here for second time, said that the first visit facing whole day raining and cannot play. Luckily, we have shower in the morning, but hot during the day, so we can enjoy our time. Hopefully, if we visit here again the hotel is have been operated and the city more busy, so we can come here more easily.",4.0
4344,Not too bad a visit on a weekday,"Certain part of the park is still not completed. Weather can be hot and raining in Malaysia. If there are more tree or shelter built up in the parking place, it will be perfect. Good to go in the weekday as there are less crowd. Like the different city build up with Lego. Most of the station is non aircon and outdoor, thus remember to bring umbrella, sun tan lotion, cap if you visit on a sunny day. Managed to complete the place with ride activity in 2 hours (due to no crowd).",3.0
4345,Overrated International Brand...,"To me this place is more for kids, the attractions are not that much for adults, just casual walk and a couple of photograph sessions at miniland. Entry ticket is quite pricey but worth it if you bring children together with you.Well, there are about 40 rides altogether. I think a lot has already been said about Legoland from other reviewer and I think I shouldn't say more. The sun and the heat (33-35 degrees) is putting me off to enjoy the park. Well a bit unlucky with our trip as after only about an hour under the hot sun, heavy rain came suddenly. We're stuck inside the crowded souvenir shop for almost an hour.Here are a few tips for everyone who are planning to visit Malaysia Legoland.1. It is very, very hot and humid. Wear hats as big as you can lol and apply sunblock if you don't wanna get free sun-tanned.2. Buy your tickets online. The queue for purchasing tickets could be crazy sometimes and it is also cheaper to buy online.3. Better to have your lunch outside the park as it hell a lot cheaper and variety. Some said you can't re-enter the park once go out.. but it's not true.",3.0
4346,Best Legoland!,"My 8 year old son loved this Legoland park!The family friendly rides and set up make it ideal for 8 to 10 year old Lego fans, and an ideal day trip from Singapore.No crowd during our midweek visit, so he got to enjoy his favorite rides over and over until he was satisfied.Had lunch at the pizza/pasta palce the usual park food, nothing extraordinary but not bad either. But what impressed me the most was the staff's helpfull and cheerful attitude and how clean and looked after the park is.So, dont forget your hats sunscreen and shades and  try to visit during the week to avoid the crowds!",5.0
4347,Good family fun!,"Malaysia Legoland is more about family fun and rides than the original Legoland in Denmark, which has a lot more history and displays of lego.  We went on a week day and I think that would be my first big tip...it's clear that they cater to big queues but we didn't have any today for any rides!  Amazing!!  My kids, aged 8 and 10, loved every bit of it.  They went on every ride and, because it wasn't ridiculously busy, managed a few rides on the roller coasters etc.  It was hot but we found shade if needed.  There is a room to build lego in which was air conditioned and a good spot to stop for a while if the heat gets too much or you just need to ""catch your breath"" but still keep the kids busy.  Food was very reasonable and varied in choice.  You could get a pass-out to eat at restaurants outside of Legoland if you preferred.  Toilet facilities etc. very clean. Lockers available too. The water park was not complete when we were there but we did go on one water ride which managed to soak us but we dried fairly quickly and it was nice to be cooled down!  You could purchase a rain cape if you didn't want to get wet.  Great ride though.....would recommend.  4D movie was a real treat at the end of our day.  Overall, I'd recommend as a good day out and with water activities to be added it would be even better.  Great family fun park day and if a lego fan, then added bonus!",4.0
4348,Very good,"A very good theme park. A bit hot since most of the attractions are open air attractions. Mini world is superb. The cafe is a bit small but the food is good. Bring umbrella, sun block, cap; anything that can protect you from the element.",4.0
4349,8 and 10 year old give this Excellent!,"We went to Legoland Malaysia on a day trip from Singapore.  Our family, 2 adults and 2 children aged 8 and 10 had a great day.  The park was quiet with no queues for any of the attractions.  This may have been because of the smoke haze from Sumatra but it did not stop us from getting out and about, however there was about 45min when the rides were closed apparently due to the smoke level, but the 3d cinema and other indoor areas remained open.  The staff were extremely helpful and friendly. I must admit it was a first for us to actually have the roving photographers stop us and offer to take photos of our family with our own cameras and no pressure to buy the photos they take on their cameras.  Legoland is still being built but the construction did not impact on the areas already set-up.  Our children were the right age group, I do not know if this attraction would be suitable for older teenagers.  People complain that it is hot, but hey you are in Malaysia so it is going to be warm regardless.  A number of the attractions are water based so it is easy to cool down and you are dry again in no time.  We will be back to stay when the resort opens next year.",5.0
4350,Enjoyed very much - No rush on a weekday,Enjoyed very much - No rush on a weekday I personally enjoyed it very much because my daughter was able to access all the rides and shows w/o any queue because we went on a weekday. It was a rainy day also so we didn't get sun burnt at all. Enjoyed the trip very much. Restaurant is also very nice and reasonable price. Have a great day in Legoland.,5.0
4351,No queues. Great day for the kids,"Visited the park after previously going to Legoland Windsor in England. Very similar indeed, however there was virtually nobody there.  We literally had some rides to ourselves. Big new water park currently being built on the site that looks great. Expect that that will increase the crowds considerably. Just one thing;  really wish they would colour code the maps so that you knew the minimum height for each ride before you go to it.  it would really avoid unnecessary tears!  Overall, a good day out for youngish children.",4.0
4352,Its better in the rain but,"With three boys this place is great. When it is raining it is better as there is not ,much shade.. But when it rains a few attractions close down. Easy drive and.

4353,Had a nice time!,"Roller coaster is thrilling, but to those who have heights fear, might find it boring as there aren't much to play. But those with kids can consider making a trip there, they will enjoy and love it to max. ",5.0
4354,Legoland - As Expected!,"A visit to Legoland is long overdue. I have heard many reviews from it been very hot, not too many places to rest, rides are more suitable for the adults etc. and basically, that is all true. Is the trip worth it? My answer is absolutely yes - the tickets are not too expensive and the mini world is probably worth paying for. Seeing how famous landmarks been constructed with Lego bricks is an experience worth paying despite all the other shortcomings. While Lego is in synch with our lives for so many years, unfortunately, not many characters in Lego stand out. As a result, the shows does not excite the children as much. In addition to that, Legoland can do with more trees and areas where people can wait in comfort. Learn from Universal Studios where waiting areas are fully enclosed with air con or if not, under cool shade. The merchandise are too expensive even compared to buying from outside shopping complex, Legoland could do more and give better value/promotions. Lastly, there are just too few activities dealings with Lego bricks. 1-2 classes on Lego robotics and one area where you can build your own cars to race down the tracks. Come on, Legoland, you could better than that. We all grown up with Lego bricks, for sure you can come out with more activities for the children and adult alike using Lego bricks. ",3.0
4355,Decent theme park for a good day out,"Legoland Malaysia, whilst not as vast or as interesting and Legoland Florida and London, still makes for a good day out with the kids. We've had an annual pass for both the London and Malaysia Legoland, and our 7-year old kids enjoy visiting both. Miniland is geared towards Asian cities with a focus on Malaysia. Although I felt that the moving and interactive features were not as extensive as in the other Legolands, the kids still loved it. There is a fair distribution of rides and play areas for little ones under 6 and for the over-6s. Study the online map and plan your trip to cover the most age-appropriate attractions for your kids. I found the live shows to be quite 'staged' and generally a let down, so it may be better to go for the 4D show instead. The Dragon coaster, Project X, Boating School, Build and Test, Pharoah's Revenge the log ride are fast favourites for kids between 5-9.Food in Legoland is sparse, and there is hardly any vegetarian food available. Don't fret - for vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike, there is a small open air shopping mall directly across the Legoland entrance with a good variety of restaurants ranging from Thai food, a biryani rice restaurant and a Burger King. Another tip is to ensure you pack a brolly and/or raincoats as it often rains in Legoland Malaysia.",4.0
4356,Average theme park,"Having been to legoland in CA, if you're expecting this park to be anything like it you will be disappointed. While the CA park is geared to all ages, the Malaysian version is geared to very very small (6 & under) children. The park is clean, however it lacks that fun of hearing kids scream on roller coasters & enjoying themselves, almost as if everyone put their polite pants on in the morning & were told to only have a little bit of fun. There's just something so clinical about it... Also, everything is an upsell - buy a season ticket, buy a box of cookies instead of just one & you're made to feel inferior if you don't purchase all these ""one day only"" specials.Take the little kids here, if they are any older (or if its jut a group of adults) they will be bored.",3.0
4357,compact and good enough,"Very compact in side and not many people even during Sunday - perhaps it's location is a bit ""middle-of-nowhere"".  Most ride requires less than 10-minute queue and it makes 2-3 hours sufficient to visit all attractions.  The miniatures are a bit too Asia/Malaysia-centred.  Would be good if you bring children.",4.0
4358,kids at heart,"everybody enjoyed the legoland trip even if it is complicated going there. Rides are cool. kids at heart will enjoy this theme park. Public transport going to LEgoland:1. From your hotel, ride a bus going to Qeenstreet station. Our hotel is at Geylang area so we rode BUS # 100 and alight at stamford primary scool stop (opp). 2. Walk to Queenstreet Terminal and rode CW2 bus going to SG and Malaysia border. CW2 is a non-stop bus. But there is also bus #170 but with in-between stops. CW2 cost 2.4 sgd / person.3. Alight at SG border and clear immigration( follow the flow of foot traffic)4. Ride the bus going to Malaysia border. But i think anybody can ride any bus. since it is already paid at #2. It is a short distance that is separated only by a bridge.5. alight the bus and clear Malaysia immigration and customs. 6. Checkout the schedule of bus going to Legoland. Confirm the schedule of LM1 bus. it is departing every hour. We cleared immigration at 10:20AM and the next bus is 11:00 am. So we ate our brunch at KFC and bought some ROTIBOY buns. :) I love the Rotiboy! it is 11MYR for 5 pieces.We arrived 12:00 pm at legoland and finished until 4:00PM Then rode bus going to JB Sentral (Malaysia Border). we catch the bus 4:15PM. OVerall is good! all went well as planned. Tip: avoid using private transport (cars, MPV) since there was a TRAFFIC jam IN and OUT the Immigration both in SG and MY. But if your private transport is 12 seater van, it will be on the Bus lane which there was no traffic jam!!!! We saved time!!! yey!Tip: Bring your foods, umbrella ( no shades in the theme park) and extra shirt because you will be burning fats because it hot and sweaty!Tip: buy your tickets online (official website) 7 days advance to get 20% discount.",4.0
4359,Fantastic for Lego fans,"We visited on a Monday and lucked a quiet day. The new hotel under construction looks wonderful (as does the water park) as we stayed at KSL in JB. Until the legotel opens our advice is to spend the RM$90-110 for a return taxi trip and use the metered blue cabs instead of the bus (if you are not driving). This gives you maximum flexibility to be there from park open to close - during the school holidays the park is open till 8pm but the buses leave at 6pm. The staff are friendly and there are plenty of food options that from our perspective were not unreasonble - Malay food by tehnics was under RM$10 to pizza, burgers, chicken & chips elsewhere for under RM$20.  Pack plenty of water and parents will be relieved to know there are a lot of sptlessly clean toilets! We were concerned about heat but found the park had a reasonable wind, at least when we were there. You can always go for the indoor attractions like the 4D theatre for chill time.Another tactic is to do the log fume ride early on as you will get wet - very wet. Big tip is to take off watches and anything else you don't wish to get drenched (there are open lockers under CCTV surveillance so put it all into a back pack). Golly it was fun. I did three rides and was sodden but it also acted like air con for the entire day! There are body driers for RM$10 but why?  Being wet in 30 degree plus heat helps to cool you down and by day's end you will be dry.For us we were lucky as there was no queues at all - the longest wait was 5 minutes. It was a full day with the right balance of rides and all the staff were wonderful.In terms of lego prices in the shops it is not cheap but look out for things/sets not found elsewhere.  You can also buy lego pieces by weight RM$35 per 100 grams, which can be useful. What i had hoped for was a lego 'clearance corner' of sets no longer being produced but that wasn't to be. Another odd missing piece was the absence of the Kuala Lumpur's Petronas Towers in the lego architecture series (it was on Nat Geo's Mega Structures).Oh you can get a pass out - check with guest services before exiting - because Hello Kitty Town is a RM$40 return ride away (bob the builder also there too). We left, knocked that off in two hours, had dinner and reentered the park at 6pm when the bus exodus took place. Legoland was even emptier meaning it was even more fun and the staff appreciated the company.In terms of souvenirs there are tons of photographers and it can be printed onto your own lego, which comes with a photo key ring and photo magnet for RM$200. Pricey yes, but kind of cool, which sums up our feelings about Legoland Malaysia. We will be back when the hotel opens.",5.0
4360,better than uss,for child age -12 this playland is perfect.many games to play and during my visit less crowd less waiting time for a play..,3.0
4361,Clean and great if you have young children,"Went with friends and we're a group of young adults who happened to be in JB for a wedding - the trip to legoland was spontaneous and since we did not make a special trip for legoland I'd say it was a really pleasant surprise! The Lego structures of Asian cities were so cool and the first thing we saw. However, the rides were mainly for children, but there were some ""mildly challenging"" rides for adults too. The kids' rides resembled the ones I remember going to as a child in Legoland, England - so that's good! I was particularly impressed by the cleanliness of the park and the food, although pricey was worth it (half chicken with soup and drink was RM25, and we receive an RM10 food voucher with entrance ticket). All in all worth a trip if you happen to be in JB (for young adults) and worth it if you have money to spend and have children (admission tickets are quite expensive if you're earning ringgits - RM130!) Great job Legoland and keep up the impressive maintenance!Tip: It gets really hot there so bring a hat, apply sunblock and keep hydrated! ",4.0
4362,Legoland,My kids are happy but not for me and my hubby. We find that there the staff look boring and no much sound effect. ,3.0
4363,Could have been planned a bit better,"Was very excited and happy to finally make it to Legoland - have been a Lego addict in the past. The approach of the park could have been different. The walk from the car park to the entrace is quite a bit. A large part is covered but given that one is almost on the equator the heat can be a bit too much. Even the rain could be a handfull to manage. The car park itself is a bit confusing especially if you are coming for the first time. The staff are all very very friendly. That was a nice experience. Once inside, the park is made up in a typical manner with small hubs where multiple rides are located. The connectivity of the different sections could have been better in the sense that all of them are long walks and without cover - so if the sun or rain are pelting down one is going to suffer. There a are a lot of rides but most of them are for kids. There are 3 external roller coasters of which one is for the kids. The other 2 are big but nothing like the Mummy or the Cyclone in Universal in Singapore. There might have been one more inside the Egyptian complex but I am not sure as we did not go in.   In the centre of the park is the exhibit for the replicas of important buildings in Asia. This was very nice to see. However, the Sun and heat gets to you. Being located in the centre it is also a bit difficult to decide when to schedule this - in the beginning or at the end. THe entire park is made up to look like it  has been made from lego bricks. While it is good for kids and hardcore serial Lego addicts it may get a bit monotonous for others. The food options are OK - like any other theme park. Neither great nor bad. Overall, certainly worth one visit. A must do if you have 5 to 15 year olds in the family. In that case this is a great attraction. Could have been planned better - seems to be frayed at the edges compared to Universal in Singapore.",3.0
4364,Kids had a blast - Mum and dad also!,Checked out Legoland on a day trip from Singapore through WTS travel. Not overly impressed with the bus trip that was half an hour late leaving the Flyer AND Legoland waiting for a couple of late passengers! Why delay the trip for a whole bus load of people because of a couple of inconsiderate passengers?Anyway aside from that the park itself was great. We had read all the reviews about the heat etc but it was not that bad the day we went (Mon 2 Sep) and we only had a brief bit of rain in the afternoon but a massive lightening storm after the park had closed! We also went on a week day not in school holidays and seriously there would not have been more then a few hundred people. We went on the rides over and over again with no waiting in lines. The kids even had a Lego Robotics class all to themselves! I can't imagine how frustrating it would be to go on a busy day and queue for ages in the heat with the kids for a ride that lasts just a few minutes. I would suggest avoiding it during Malaysia/Singapore school holidays and weekends!As other reviewers have mentoned the rides are geared towards younger kids but us oldies enjoyed the larger roller coasters. Teens looking for jaw dropping thrills will need to look elsewhere though! All in all this was a great day out. The kids are already eyeing off the Legoland Hotel and waterpark currently under construction!,5.0
4365,The World in Bricks,"Our trip here was on our 2nd day at Singapore, so we managed to get a packaged tour which already included the entrance fee to the theme park.  It was a 45 mins bus ride & made two stops 1 - Singapore immigration & at the Immigration of Malaysia.  The ride was cool & comfy & the view was nice as you get to see a glimpse of Singapore's outskirts as well as the immediate vicinity of Johor Bahru.  Since we're quite a number & have several kids on board, we laughed as they all shrieked with excitement upon seeing the Legoland Hotel's facade.  Once there, we immediately posed at the park's marker & proceeded to enter.  The park boasts of rides, game rooms for the different park's motif, an observation tower, similar to that in Sentosa Island, Singapore, & of course the crowd drawer- the amazing famous landmarks of the world in bricks.  I marvel at the intricate labor put on this place & what makes it even more cute is that is has buttons whic you press to hear the specific country's song, sound of the structure's theme like for the Tianamen Square it has the dragon dance beat where the characters move to life.. and we were surprised to find our entry there - the town of Bolinao, Pangasinan, complete with the fishing village, vessels, jeeps karitelas & structures around town! The staff  were all courteous & very assistive.  You can likewise ask them  to take your pictures as many shots as you please.  In case you don't have RMs ( currency) they accept SG dollars but if you have change it will be in ringgits. ( the rate when we were there was P1: RM 13). The children will definitely have fun in this as they get to squeeze their creative juices in the activity booth & the rides are good as well.  In case you need to fuel up your hunger pangs, food stalls/kiosks/restaurants are conveniently located around, of course there's always the Legoland Hotel for a more sphisticated food choice.  But if you're craving for more, you can go out of the park to the Medini Mall, where you can grab a taste of western cuisine & the other known food chains.  The park operates from 10am - 8pm since we were there on  a Saturday.  But since we're on a tour we chose to pick the 5pm pick-up time.  It was just enough to fully explore the park.",4.0
4366,LEGOLAND - finally!,"As a family TOTALLY adicted to Lego, visiting legoland has been a long held dream.  Unfortunately all the European legolands are closed over winter (the only time we ever get to venture north).  So the discovery of the newly opened Legoland in Malaysia was like a dream come true!We stayed at KSL in JB andused there package deal to visit Legoland - good value!Our 8 hours at the park were not excessive, but i do not think it is more than a one day visit.The park itself was amazing; paradise on earth for Lego fans.  The theming, scale, diversity and animation of the displays was brilliant.  The rides ranging and suitable for the young to the fearless.  Mini-world Asia was overwhelming.Shops were great - retail prices, so no bargains, but TOTALLY like being in a lolly-shop!  The PICK - A-BRICK wall was fantasic.ONLY disappointment was the food; as ""westerners"" we would have love some Asian food - and all that was available within Legoland was ""fast-food"".  Good Asian food was available in the plaza before Legoland and the ""local Malaysian food supermarket was a delight to explore""LEGOLAND Malaysia - just FANTASTI",5.0

4368,Great for young kids,"Vacationing in Singapore and found a coach bus for a day trip to this newly opened theme park.  My boys are 5 and 8 and loved it.  It was hot, but we brought an umbrella, went on the log ride a lot, and went into the buildings to cool down.  The rides are perfect for young kids.  The day we went there were no lines.  The playground was fun for the kids.  The fire truck ride/game was perfect for the whole family to do together against other groups.  The observation tower was nice to cool down and see an overview of the park.  The restaurant had good inexpensive food.  The store didn't have a large Lego selection and they are overpriced.  Spent the whole day and went on many rides again and again because there were no lines.  Would love to come back when the water park and hotel open.",5.0

I recommend bringing an umbrella because it is occasionly wet. Oh and weekdays are so nice and quiet! You can go straight onto the rides! Awesome place!!!!,5.0

4372,Take umbrellas for shade,Not all quite finished but our kids aged 5 and 2 (boys) loved it. Was extremely hot as there was minimal shade. Would highly recommend taking umbrellas to provide some protection from the sun. If you're there after 3pm you may need them for rain too. Some indoor activities and lunch inside with aircon. We tried to alternate inside and out to reduce the stress of the heat. We are Australians who live in Manila so didn't expect to have a problem with the heat - but we did!Be warned not all lego sets are available in the main shop. Our 5 year old had clear ideas about what he wanted and we couldn't deliver. VERY disappointed. Really expected lego land to have everything.,4.0

4377,Adults: go for once-in-a-lifetime experience. Kids will enjoy this place.,"After six hours at this theme park, I realized that 80% of it is catered to kids. I felt the attractions (rollercoasters and such) were more thrilling at the good, old Genting Theme Park. It is a spacious theme park, so it is good for family with young kids to stroll or run around. Games and attractions are pretty mild (thrilling for children, I guess) and since the ticket to get in is expensive (RM140 at full price and I went on a Sunday), there is hardly any queue at the attractions (in comparison to Genting which could lead to a 30-45 mins in queue for a ride).Lego merchandise being sold here are pretty awesome and I might just come back to buy them and to check out the water park. I wouldn't have a repeat visit to the normal park though with the less-than-thrilling rides and an expensive entry.Oh, the locker/storage facilities are expensive. So I wouldn't recommend bringing valuable items to the park.",3.0

Having been to Universal Studio in LA and Disneyland California, this theme park does not catch my attention at all when it was opened to public.However, during the recent holiday eve, I together with my family went there to have a look. I told my children that if there were too many visitors, we would not enter the park. To our surprise, there wasn't many visitors that day. So we decided to go in to have 'a look'. To our surprise, it was way above my expectation! We really enjoyed all the rides and the lively and beautiful sculptures made up of Lego bricks. I must say it was really educational to all children visiting the park. Even elderly people like me also enjoyed all the facilities in the Theme park. We really had a great day there! The only setback is the hot weather. So be prepared to bring your umbrella!",4.0
4383,Nice for family outing even for kids as young as 4 years old !,"Even though we went on a weekend, we still manage to enjoy almost all the rides. My 4 year old especially enjoy the roller coaster ride,The Dragon (most of the time, he is too young to ride and can only watch from far) which is safe for his height (minimum 100cm). Of course the waiting period is very long (almost 1 hour). The train ride closes quite early though, about 1 hour before the closing time. We had to miss that one. Other than that, my boys manage to play 2-3 rounds at Lego City attractions....Please remember to bring sun block lotion, cap and extra shirt for kids.

Thankfully we came prepaired with lots of water and caps to cover our heads. But I found it too hot to enjoy it as much as Windsor Legoland UK. The queues weren't too long but it wasn't very well organised. Some of the rides eg the fire engine were out of order so made the queuing time even longer. Food in the restaurant was as you expect in these sort of places, terrible. We had the chicken rice and fish and chips and could not eat it.

4387,Go on a weekday and bring some shade!,"We went on a weekday and it was worth it - no crowds and the kids could go on rides over and over again!! There were many eating establishments so there's alot of choice and the prices were not bad. One thing I would suggest to management though would be to have more natural shade across the park. Although they have made much effort to have shelters, it would be very beneficial if there were larger trees so as to provide some cover. It was an extremely hot day we were there and although there were hats and sunscreen applied it was still an extremely hot day. Nevertheless the kids enjoyed themselves. ",5.0

As we went on weekdays and not during school or public holidays the crowd is quite thin and there was hardly any queue at the entrance and most of the rides. My son was able to repeat some of his favourite rides without having to queue again. For adults without children the rides here may not be too much fun as most rides are suitable for children.",4.0

Queuing was covered and they had fans going as well, the queues were not long, it was a Sunday. Arrived about 11am and didn't leave until 5pm.  We travelled from Singapore you need to go through immigration so make sure you keep the visitor card in your passport (the card they leave in your passport when you arrive in Singapore) we didn't and it was a real hassle, you do need it and we held our bus up by about 20 minutes which was not good.",4.0
4390,The Colorful World of Legoland,"Legoland, in Johor Bahru Malaysia, is a new attraction that opened in 2012 and getting there by your own is a bit difficult so better book your coach tickets in advance to avoid the hassle. We got there via WTS Coach parked at Singapore flyer. Be there as early as 8Am to claim your Legoland entrance tickets as the queues can be really long and time-consuming. Avoid going there on a weekend or during public holidays. For the return trip, the bus guide will be giving a brief instruction on the time and place to embark so be attentive when she starts talking. The attraction opens at 10AM to 6PM.  Legoland entrance is quite a distance walk from the parking area where we alighted and just imagine how hot it is if you get there by noontime. This attraction has just opened for less than a year so there aren‚Äôt any big trees yet that will serve as shade. To protect your precious skin from too much sun exposure, don‚Äôt forget to lather on a generous amount of sunblock, hats and umbrellas; and bring bottled water to keep yourself hydrated. The 6-themed areas of Legoland: 1. Lego Technic2. Miniland 3 .Lego Kingdoms4. Imagination5. Land of Adventure 6. Lego City Nearly all rides have waiting time of about 20mins to an hour, but its all fun and worth the wait. My kids loved the project X, Aquazone Wave Racers and Dino Island Adventure. The best part for me was Miniland, where they showcased the beautiful countries of Asia in colorful miniature legos!  The whole place is surrounded by colorful legos- miniatures and gigantic ones, which by the way, looks great in every photo. We ate lunch at Pizza Mania. My kids did not like it a bit. After queuing from a long line of customers what we got is the thin pizza meal that is crispy yet too bland for our taste and unappetizing with just tiny bits of veggies and meat that includes a drink and a tiny bowl of fruit. Food price was too high for the food value and quality. We ordered 2 family meals and 2 kiddie meals and our bill came up to more than a RM100. We were disappointed and not satisfied with the service.We also did not like the dirty toilets as its way way below standards compared to other attractions in Singapore and Hong Kong that we have been to. We think that they definitely need to improve on that aspect. It‚Äôs worth visiting though, especially for kids and adults who love legos. We might be going back on 2014 when the under-construction hotel nearby and the water park would be available for the public.",3.0

There is a small strip mall where you'd walk through to get to the park - keep your ticket stubs and you may re-enter the park if you choose to eat at the shops in the strip mall.  Try hopping into a cab or arrange for a shuttle service if possible - the entrance is quite a ways from the park.",3.0

There were 4 of us in the group including my 11 year old nephew, his mother and my 15 year old daughter.   WTS bus coach from Flyer-Singapore was really nice, bus was comfortable and driver with guide were very informative.  Legoland was very big with enough restrooms and restaurants.  I have used 2 restrooms from different area of the park and both were clean but a bit stinky and 1 had no toilet paper in the cube I used.  My daughter did some souvenir shopping and got a bit frustrated because the color legoblock key chain she wanted was available in one of the shops but there was no engraving service available so we have to walk around and look for  a shop with engraving service.  Another thing is that there was really not enough shade the trees are not fully grown yet and there is not enough covered area in the park.

There were a few rides suitable for adults, all included in the admission price. The mini land display was just amazing and it was easy to recognise all the places exhibited. We spent quite a bit of time just looking at that. Keep an eye out for all the cute Lego characters and animals placed around in gardens and in little out of the way places.The food and souvenirs are very expensive - much more than you would expect for Malaysia.This was a great day out and I think is a fantastic place for anyone of any age if you love Lego.",5.0

We had booked a Maxicab (Mercedes Viano) and I think it was well worth the money not having to go by bus.The only thing I would suggest is to wear the highest factor sunblock you can find, it gets hot here and you will get exposed to the sun which is suprisingly strong.

4404,Excellent for Preschoolers age 3 and above,"We have 2 kids aged 5 and 2. 5 years old can play most of the rides and he had lots of fun. My 2 yr old toddler can't join any rides and those rides supposely for her age are closed for renovation, to our disappointment. But my 5yr old enjoyed almost all the rides. Its definitely more fun than USS which is for older age grp. Most rides r for min 3yrs old. Queue is also short as compared to USS which is super crowded. Maybe bec they have more rides too. Park rides queue is systematic and in and out Q are well managed and staff professional.The main drawback is super hot weather with no or little shade. The park really need to improve on offering more shade or plant more trees. And most of their shops have no air-con, restaurants/eateries have poor air-con. Only the cafe at main entrance has cool air-con, the rest all poor or no air-con. So hot that I dun have the mood to shop for merchanise though i have intention to spend. Only the shop at main entrance sell sunblock. Having forgotten my sunblock at the hotel, I can't find any single sunblock at other shops (cos only realise that its super hot halfway at the park) only to realise at the end of trip when leaving that only the main entrance shop sell sunblock. I should think every shop should sell sunblock since its so hot everywhere. Rides should have more shade so we can enjoy on the rides. My toddler suffered from sun burn as a result.Food so-so throughout. Portion little for the lasi lemak rice lunch I had. Ice-cream and water everywhere which is a plus. Price of food reasonable and expected of typical theme park prices. Shops - the BIG shop at main entrance is the best selling more things. Small shops along the way are repeated and can be found at the big shop. Prices reasonable, many lego toys, tees etc. The interesting feature is the lego bricks placed inside those sweet boxes just like those u found at sweets shop but instead of sweets, its different colour of lego bricks for u to mix and match. Its inside the photo booth shop at main entrance so dun skip that shop thinking that it sell only photos (signboard of shop is a bit misleading). The shop merchanise are almost all for kids and nothing much for adults except magnets, keychains. Considering that most lego toys are available outside toy stores, maybe the park can consider selling lego bricks chocolates since usually tourists will buy chocolate for gifts etc, or more specialise merchanise. However, I find that the park is less commercialise and main attractions are the rides. It is quite well balanced unlike USS which is more commercialise.Staff - most of the staff are polite and professional. Speed is considered good and comparable to SG stores or typical themepark. Understanding of English is okay (may need 1 repeating but they can understand English). Rides Qs are orderly, signboards and park design is such that you won't lost your way (easily readable). Reasonable time to spend inside if u have kids who will take most of rides, inclusive of lunch, shopping, resting etc - 3 to 5 hours.  Bring along umbrella, hats, sunblock, electronic fan, water.

4405,Amazing Place,"A must go place, we had a wonderful time here...took loads of pics..it's easy to go from Singapore as its just an hour away, book tickets online it's cheaper and look for package deals online as well as it will be cheaper. Don't forget your passport and departure buds that you get at Singapore airport, we forgot ours at our hotel and had to wait at the Singapore customs for 40mins ;(..Legolands photographer are available at most place around the park so do ask them to take pics in their camera as well...their photo packages are great..also there's a new water park building as well which will open soon",5.0
4406,One of Asia's Best Family Attractions,"Legoland is an excellent day outing for families, and geared toward kids under 12. It's well managed and even the food court is a cut above other parks in Asia. One day is enough and it can be hot but we found the park fine for 4-5 hours. We came from Singapore and was a good day trip.",4.0
4407,Well worth a visit,"Interesting and fun place for young children.  I would recommend for kids 5-6 years and above due to the limited number of rides available below that age group, but still there are always something for them to do.  We were lucky to get a cloudy day otherwise do remember to bring sun block, water and shades.  One day outing is sufficient till more rides is up and running.",4.0
4408,Staff need customer service training,"We have been to LEGOLAND California and LEGOLAND Florida - so wanted to check this one out.  The thing we were disappointed is with the staff.  They are working with kids so I would of thought LEGOLAND would employ staff who loved kids.  I noticed that because English wasn't their first language sometimes kids didn't quite understand them - such as getting of the boats - so when they hesitated the staff got really grumpy and snapped at them.  This happened a number of times with a number of kids.  So hopefully LEGOLAND Malaysia will read this and get their staff to be a little more kid friendly.  The park itself is great and The miniland was great.  The hotel getting built looks great, so in  year or so it should be fantastic.The toilets are dirty considering its only been opened a short time...but that is a reflection of the staff not cleaning very well.",4.0
4409,Legoland is awsome,"This attraction is fun for everyone, regardless of your age.  I had a ball.  There are plenty of attractions for all the family.  Some are children only but the adults still have fun watching, particularly at the Driving school.  Keep your eyes open as Lego figures can be found hiding amongst the bushes and sitting on seats.  Sit down and take a photo.  We spent about 6 hours at the park.  This was jsut enough time to see and photo graph everything.  Longer would have been good but we were very tired and hot.The staff are friendly and all speak good english for the non-malay speakers.  Tthis is greatly appreciated.  I look foward to returning when the Leo Hotel is finished.There is plenty of shade at attractions but not inbetween so be sure to wear your hat and sunscreen.  Have a great day.",5.0
4410,Great fun!,"Went there during the last days of 2013 Raya holiday with husband, two young daughters, and the nanny.We were lucky because we chose that day to go, since although it was a Sunday, most people were done with their holiday so it wasn't too full. Q for attractions were only long-ish. We q-ed only around 15-20 minutes, the longest. Most were only about 5-10 mins. Not bad. And to make things even better, it was a cloudy day with light shower every now and then, so we didn't experience the ""stinging heat"" that most of my friends complained about.Place was clean and lovely, very well maintained. Although the toilets were pretty smelly. I wonder why almost every toilet in malaysia, has a foul toilety smell? I hate that. Eventhough it's clean, still, the smell always present somehow. Strange.Really love the miniland. Great great artwork.Foods in the park were okay. There were enough varieties offered. I particularly loved the cinnamon bun they sell in the cafe in across the giftshop near the entrance.We rent a double stroller, and the stroller was clean and in good condition.Rides are more child friendly compared to universal studio, whiich means weren't too extreme. My 4 year old ride the roller coaster for the first time and she loved it so much now she's addicted to roller coasters.For the baby (i got my 1 y.o  with me also), she enjoyed playing with the ground squirty water thingy (not sure what it was called?) near the roller coaster ride. Everybody got wet. Luckily we brought change of clothes. The baby playground was also a great fun. And the train ride.Definitely will visit again, but will wait until the hotel and waterpark are done. Will be even more interesting then. I think this place gives more fun if your kids are below 5y.o, compared to universal studio. One bad thing, my husband lost his wallet in the park. Vanished without a trace. Staff were pretty helpful in receiving his complain, two of them even helped him looked around the park, but still no luck.Tips to future visitors, bring sunblocks, sunglasses, hats, umbrellas....it can get really hot here during sunny day. Prepare a whole day to be in the park, and prepare your transport since it can get a bit difficult to catch a taxi from legoland back to ur hotel in the evening. The security guard doesn't help much, and there was no taxi ramp, and the park is really in the middle of nowhere.",4.0
4411,Legoland Multi Pass,"This is a must buy if you want to really enjoy the park at your own stride. Bought this Multi Pass ticket with stay at Grand Sentosa hotel in Jb at the MATTA travel fair. Apparently this was the only agent that sold these pacakge New Asia Holidays, at very affordable rate for a family of 2 adults 1Child....Multi Pass was the answer for unstressfull 2 days....great New Asia Holiday for being innovatiove",4.0
4412,Hot and crowded!,"We went to Legoland on 09 Aug 2013 which is Singapore National Day.  Probably due to that, the place was full of family visitors.  The rides are fun and many of them are suitable for children under teenage years.  The queues for all rides were long.  We could only manage to ride on 6 rides only from 10:00am till 4:30pm (it started raining then).  The food at cafe  was expensive (Adult set RM23, Child set RM15).  What made it worse was they provided so little food for the visitors that the chicken rice was sold out!!!  it was so ridiculous as we had the money but no food was left!!  As a result a long queue was waiting for the new pot of chicken rice being cooked for more than 40 minutes.  The weather was hot.  The Legoland souvenirs were costly.  The meals were expensive.  My opinions? OK if just to check out.  Not so worthwhile for a family day.",3.0
4413,Suitable for the whole family especially the young kids,"I decided to go to Legoland with my mum first before suggesting to my other family members with kids. We bought the Legoland package including the hotel stay at Hotel Selesa. We were at the entrance very early as it was during the school holidays. There are lots of parking space available, and it was free at that time (now there is a parking rate imposed, I think maximum rate is RM7). While waiting for the gate to open, there were few Legoland mascots at the gate entertaining the youngs (and olds too!), so the kids especially will be less restless. When the time to open the gates, the staffs were counting down together with the visitors. They are everywhere to help you with anything, for example I was approached by one staff offering me to take a photo of me and my mum using my camera. Since there are lots of rides for children, so we tried out the ones that we could ride like the boat and train rides etc. We loved the Lego miniatures especially the ones where we could see some actions (for example, there was a group of mini people were dancing round and round at Taj Mahal accompanied by a Bollywood song, pirates bombing other ships etc). The queues were not long (maybe because we were the early ones there) except for one ride where we had to wait for 1 hour 15 minutes in the afternoon. At that time, it was so freaking hot that there were some families with small children just left the queue since the children were restless and making some noises due to the heat. There are fans but only a few and they are situated very high above that we could not feel the breeze. So if you want to go to Legoland, maybe it's good to bring portable fans and sunblock lotion for you and your kids. There are not many shades there since the trees were still young, and not many covered places available here. I feel that maybe the management should add more chairs for people to wind down. The food is a bit pricey but you can go out of Legoland and go to Malls of Medini just in front of Legoland entrance where you can have more affordable choices like KFC, OldTown, Cool Blog etc (just make sure you stamp your hand to re-enter Legoland). As for the show, at that time, there was no pamphlet/information sheet informing the time of the show, thus we had to go to those places (like 4D etc) to get the show times (a bit inconvenient for us). I just hope the management has provided the show times at present. Overall, I guess maybe it is not so suitable for babies/toddlers (they can be screaming all the time because of the heat, and not so much activities for them)  but definitely fit for 3/4-year olds and above. I would recommend that everybody should go there at least once.",4.0
4414,Good !,"we went last June 2013 during school holiday, it was not a lot of people as we came during weekday and not a long Q on each game. Only one thing that's make the trip worst as during that time there was heavy haze. Some construction still on going for Hotel and water park which I am sure when it's done it will increase more patron. I was lost my HP as I left it on one of the bench and it was found by group and family which so kind and honest to return back the phone safely, thank you so much!",4.0
4415,Overhyped.,"Legoland is very overhyped. Our experience soured from the very start where the travel agent ""WTS Travels"" at Singapore Flyer was very rude with most guests. We left the place after a full hour becoz of which we had lesser time to spend at Legoland. Also there were hardly any outlets which served vegetarian food - which is a matter of concern considering that a big chunk of tourists that visit Singapore & Malaysia are from India and a sizeable percentage of tourists are vegetarian. The authorities need to take urgent notice of the same.",3.0
4416,A pleasant surprise!,"We went to Legoland JB because my teenage son would want to see the Star Wars stuffs in Lego. After hearing so many negative reviews, we were actually pleasantly surprised.1.  it was pleasantly clean. There were many food outlets before entering Legoland. There were also many food outlets in Legoland. However, prices can be a little steep (a small piece fruit cost me RM4)2.  The staffs all over Legoland were generally well versed in English and also very polite and helpful. They seemed very knowledgeble about the park.3.  the rides were good but please do not compare them with Disneyland. They were good enough for family fun int he sun.4.  All the rides were open when were there. Go with an open mind. I believe we have done a fairly good job with the park. It is still small at this point but some construction are going on on the side.",4.0
4417,Super hot but great for young kids,"Visited Legoland Johor on 16 Aug 2013, ride a RED taxi ,about RM 30,from the taxi stand behind the Citrus Hotel.Avoid using the Blue taxi , because the meter will start @ RM 6.Took about 20 minutes.Can ride a bus from Larkin or JB Sentral, can stop at Senai Johor Premium Outlets ,and Hello Kitty Land ,The park opened on 10 PM , so get there early , the weather usually very hot, because Legoland is still being developed and trees for shades still quite young.Tickets can be bought on spot ,or from the internet (e-ticket) for about 112 RM.Bring umbrellas, hats , wear comfortable shoes or sandals, and also bring thin raincoat or ponchos (can buy for RM 15), cannot predict the weather here,and a precaution if ur getting soaking wet because some of the attraction venues here involved water.Prices of foods ,and drinks here are acceptable between RM 9-15 for foods ,and 5 RM for drinks, quite cheap for a themed park.Nice attractions , 4D theatre (a bit damp smell), and i really liked the miniature Lego of Singapore , Tanah Lot Bali, Thailand, Taj Mahal from India.Expect more Lego built statues, characters and venues in this Themed Park.Worth to visit at least once :-)",3.0
4418,Pleasantly surprised!,"We have been to the Windsor park several times and had read the mixed reviews on here but with a Lego mad 8 year old son, there was no way we wouldn't be able to visit!  I have to say, we were really surprised how good this park is.  It is definitely for younger children (4-10), our other children aged 11 and 13 really enjoyed it but found the majority of the rides a bit childish.  There were very short queues and the staff were really helpful.  The best rides for all 3 of our children were Project X, the Dragon and Dino Island (prepare to get soaked). The food was ok, typical theme park fare, but cheap and reasonable value for money. The park is spacious but with little shade, it was very hot and there aren't many places to stay out of the sun.  We arrived at 11am and left at 6pm, which gave us plenty of time to do everything there. The new water park (which opens later this year) looks fantastic and would definitely be worth a visit.",4.0
4419,Great for Kids !!!!!,"Went here last july 15, 2013, It's was ramadan season so there's no crowd in the park which is good!!! It's just a small park & its very hot!!! There are no trees & only a few shades so be ready to put on your sunblock & bring lots of water!!!  My daughter enjoyed the water fountain in the park maybe because it's so HOT that time hehehe! There are restaurants to eat but a little bit pricey, you can just eat at KFC outside & return at the park. I think ill be coming back here maybe in 2yrs time when the construction is finished, they're constructing a legoland hotel beside the park which is good so you can stay overnight as it is very tiring.... & I hope that they put on more rides for adults & improve there customer service....",3.0
4420,Not impressed,"Legoland in malaysia is the first of legoland franchise in Asia. It‚Äôs open for merely a year. However, during my last visit in the month of Ramadan, I saw an almost empty park and left with a bizarre feeling.TicketingLegoland Malaysia always have seasonal promotion on their website and for this visit, I managed to buy special package for family of 5 which cost me RM390 for admission of 5 persons inclusive of RM50 meal voucher. ArrivalI took the first Causeway Link bus to Legoland from JB Sentral and arrive at the park around 9am. The park is scheduled to open at 10am. The ticketing counter was opened by 9am and I exchanged my electronic booking with the ticket. I then proceeded to wait at f&b outlet within Medini Mall which is adjacent to the park entrance until the park open. The ridesThe park is divided into several zones; such as Lego Technic, Lego City, Land of Adventure, Imagination, etc as well as the Miniland which features miniatures of landmarks from Malaysia and other countries in Asia in particular Southeast Asia. Majority of the rides are designed for kids below 12 years old (although adults can participate in some of these rides, but it was not really fun at all). There are lack of rides for teenager and adults apart from few roller coasters and some water rides. I personally enjoyed the thrill rides such as the roller coasters (one is dragon theme and the other one is Lego technic theme called Project X which is essentially a mouse coaster) as well as the water rides; Aquazone Wave Racers which receives rave reviews in Legoland in America but it‚Äôs always empty at this Legoland. The log flume was unfortunately closed during my visit and this limit the number of thrill rides which I can ride even more. MinilandThe miniland is very interesting and one can see in details few landmarks in Kuala Lumpur, a scale of Kuala Lumpur International Airport, port scene in Malaysia, a portion of Johor Bahru city, and landmarks of few countries in Asia with majority of them in Southeast Asia. The details are very impressive and some features interactive button where guests can press the button and see/hear the lego miniatures in action. F&B outletsThere are couple of F&B outlets throughout the park and each is serving different type of meal/specialties. I had an opportunity to dine at The Caf√© which is located near the main entrance and it serves variety of sandwiches, bakery item, as well as lasagna and potato dishes. Pricing are more expensive than high street but it‚Äôs quite value for money given the portion and quality of the food. ShoppingApart from the Big Shop and The brick Shop which are located near the main entrance, I sensed that Legoland does not put enough effort to feature different shopping experience for each section of the park. While those which are located inside the main entrance area stock various Lego products for various theme, there is lack of shopping option in the rest of the park. I ended up buy nothing as I can easily buy the same item from Ebay. StaffI knew it was not a Disney park and the service shows. In majority of the rides, staff tend to avoid contact with visitors. There is no greeting nor a smile from the staff. They are just there to operate the ride and nothing more. As long as the ride can move, then it‚Äôs okay for them. The lack of customer service also shows in the whole area of the park, including the interactive zone, retail outlets, and part of the restaurant. Only one or two staff at The Caf√© give sincere greetings during my meal time. I found it disturbing for the park of Legoland caliber to have staff which is really ignoring the visitors. Guest Survey SystemAt few points in the park, there are computers where guests can fill feedback form. However, the funny thing about the system is that the feedback form will only go live after 1pm. I managed to finish all the sightseeing by 12noon and intended to use the computer without success. Upon exit, I saw couple of park representatives standing with tablets asking for feedback but they are too afraid to approach every guest (not sure what criteria of guests they‚Äôre looking for) as well as other staff who hold a photo frame but too afraid to ask guests to visit the photo store to print their photos in the park‚Ä¶ Verdict A good experience is not just about the hardware, but customer interaction can enhance the theme park experience indefinitely. However, this does not show at legoland Malaysia. Lack of rides for adult and lack of customer service on top of accessibility issue might be the reason of why this park sits empty on a regular day. There is a Legoland hotel underway as well as a Legoland theme park but if service standard is not to be improved, I suspect the fate would not be too different than the infamous Hard Rock park in Myrtle Beach‚Ä¶",2.0
4421,Seems to be not quite finished.,We visited legoland with a 5 year old and a 10 year old. They enjoyed the few hours we were there but the place seemed to be not quite finished. Several rides were closed and the food outlets were disappointing to say the least. The 5 year old enjoyed this more than the 10 year old and we decided to leave early.The staff however were very friendly and helpful and the shop was fairly well priced.,3.0
4422,Ok but not as good as Windsor!,We took the coach trip from Singapore for the day but wasn't great with traffic queue at immigration and inside immigration and on & off buses and waiting people etc was lot of time wasted and when we got there it's a long hot walk from the parking area! Once inside it was so much smaller than the Windsor one and the kids were ready to leave within 4 hours. Unfortunately it's a problem generally in Asia but some just don't know how to queue or feel it is beneath them to do so which greatly annoyed my 10 year old who constantly commented on people's lack of manners. It was very hot and very little shaded areas and many little drink places were closed. Maybe they can intro a better queuing system so people don't get fed up! Would be good to have some healthier food options!,3.0
4423,Malaysia 1st international theme park,"We've visited many theme parks at oversea. I believed this is the only theme park with international standard on the attractions, staffs & quality. You may find a bit hot at the park due to trees are still young can't provides any shades.The attractions are very children friendly (Some attractions are for children only) and suitable for family to participate together. Waiting time are reasonable (Average 15-30mins) compared to USS. Souvenir are expensive, maybe majority of the visitors are from Singapore.Location of the theme park is nearby the 2nd link to Singapore. Few car parks there and parked full day are RM7. Access from JB city / Singapore are very convenient & smooth. Tips: There are many options to get some discount for the tickets e.g. MyKad / Online / discount coupon.",4.0
4424,Definitely a theme park for Kids,"Visited this park On May 2013. It was not On holiday Season, so we felt like we booked this park. Not many people inside which mean my daughter could play all the rides without queque. She even played 3-4 times for 1 ride. This is definitely for kids age 5-10 years old. We spent whole day here and really enjoyed it. l like the miniature around World building from lego,  Very interesting with sound and movements.It really hot inside so prepare to bring hat or umbrella and apply sun blocks.",4.0
4425,Great,"Went there with my family. A nice place to relax. Not specifically for the young children. A number of great rides. Can spend a whole day.

4427,Fun but need improvements,"Great fun for the 8 and 10 year old. Not so good for the 12 month old. Baby couldn't participate much and almost all rides prohibit having a baby on board despite being strapped to mom or dad. Could do with more shaded seats around the park. It's scorching hot in Malaysia, an outdoor theme park without enough shaded or air conditioned rest areas, it makes it un-enjoyable for babies, mommies, elderly and the disabled. We need a place to rest up or shelter from rain, while we wait for abled young bodies running amok in the park. The restaurants? Well yes it's an option but we don't really want to be rude occupying seatings to those who need a place to eat. On August 10, the park didn't seem that crowded but the restaurants could hardly accommodate tired hungry and overheated park goers. Maybe it was the heat but the air cons especially the ones in the observation tower and family toilets need to serviced! I appreciate there are family toilets which basically includes a diaper change station. Would appreciate a sofa to facilitate nursing or milk expression. Although there is a baby room for nursing moms in a section of the park, I don't really want to walk halfway across the park in the heat to get there when I need to express milk.  Bottled waters are RM3 each. Perhaps a more Eco-conscious alternative in the availability of water coolers are much appreciated. Perhaps it was the Aidilfitri weekend park seems understaffed. Nice park overall. But just not quite world-class standards.",3.0
4428,Good fun but could be better managed,"Legoland provides a variety of rides and attractions for kids of various ages. Tip: if you have kids below 4-6yrs, you may like to start from the right route as you enter into the park (milder rides that allow kids below 110cm to participate)... as the left route provides for the older children equipped with roller coasters, etc. We were there on the second day of Raya and understand that they had record visitors that day from one of the staff. Knowing this, we realise that several of the rides were not fully opened/utilised resulting in major queues. I know waiting in line for 45min-1hr for a ride is normal for renowned parks but we cant help but feel dissapointed waiting in line when we see that only one out of 3 capacity of the ride is being opened; this was the case for at least 3 rides/activities. Hopefully this is not always the case. Anyway, we liked the Big Shop especially for the exclusive items that you can only find at the park exp Lego watches, etc.",3.0

4430,Happy place for kids & Lego Fanatics,"After months of planning, we have finally made it to Legoland Malaysia. We did not push thru with our Pariss Hotel booking since we have relatives living in Singapore and invited us to stay for free.But i strongly suggest hotels from Skudai (like Pariss Hotel) since this is one of the nearest at Legoland. Legoland is located 20 mins from downtown Johor. It is isolated that's why if you will commute, taxi will take tou there. Just make sure you ask the driver if he can go back to fetch. For me, its better if you prebook a coach/bus online. I thought they would be very strict with what can you bring inside the park. We were able to bring inside our water and some snacks. There's a mall in front of Legoland. KFC, Burger King, etc are your choices. You can eat here before going inside the park since food and drinks are much costly from the park.We noticed theres not much washrooms available! But they are clean. For smokers, there is a smoking area outside the washroom. Lego stores are awesome! Everything is so colorful and cute! My son & daughter are soo into Lego.They enjoyed the rides and also the toys!",5.0

It's a hot day and we definitely got a tan there, but drinks and food were cheap (relatively), so make sure you get plenty (the wait at some of the rides were really long). Every staff member's friendly and happy too, though they had to work on the second day of Hari Raya (I remembered how grumpy some could be in some other places). Can't wait for the hotel to be up.

So we managed to try all the rides, because none of them are looks scary.It is super hot, sunblock, hats and umbrella is necessary. It's not necessary to rent the locker because for some rides they have a shelf or a trunk to put in your belongings. Unless you bring super valuable items inside your bag then better if you rent a locker.There is a mall just outside the legoland, and selling more options for the food. So i think it's better to walk a bit far for a nicer food.",4.0
4441,A perfect day trip from Singapore,"Legoland is perfect for a day trip from Singapore. Take a taxi to the Woodlands Causeway, go through immigration twice, and then take a cab for MR26 to Legoland. Altogether it took us 1.5 hours. Legoland opens at 10:00 and the ticket prices are very reasonable. The park is absolutely clean, there are about 14 great rides all suitable for children (and most for adults too), and the restaurants are cheap. This is better than the congested Universal Pictures Studio in Sentosa or Disneyland in Hong Kong. The rides are the same but with Lego characters as the theme. The driving school, boats, and fire truck were the highlights. A waterpark opens in Oct 2013, but this is a separate ticket. By 2:30pm (4.5 hours from opening) one is ready to return to Singapore.",5.0
4442,Child friendly,"I could really say that Legoland is for children, i think adults wont enjoy it much. All the rides and activities are for kids. So bring your kids now to Legoland!",4.0
4443,great themepark- for kids 4-10,"lots of tips to share- main being- 1. go on weekday ONLY outside of Malaysian or Singaporean school holiday if at all possible- 2. book early for mindstorms (ie as soon as you arrive- for kids over 8), busiest rides are driving school and boat school- first rides on right- do this first..kfc is outside front door - one passout allowed per day - OH and if you think that buying lego here is cheaper than say- in australia - NEGATIVE= costs just as much if not more- the stuff you will end up buying are character costumes- like chima swords and shields etc etc- NOR is the range they keep any bigger then what you will find at toyrsrus back home...weird..",4.0
4444,Small and unfinished but still fun theme park,"My son is mad about Lego, so this Lego Land in Malaysia is a must for this summer holiday. It was raining most the day which damped a little bit of our enthusiasm, after spend quite a few Singapore dollars (they take Singapore dollars for everything) on Lego raincoats and umbrella, we still managed to have a fund day. The biggest disappointment was this theme park still has quite a large part to be finished but the website any promotions didn‚Äôt mention it. The highlight was we had all operating rides with very short queues because it was quiet. Retail and food was popular, the Big Shop was the most crowded place, and personalized Lego stuffs are fantastic souvenir ideas. Compare with the one in the States, this one is tiny and not 100% ready, but at least there is a Lego land in Asia now. Outside food places and waiting taxis are very handy after a day walking around. All in all, if you have children, it‚Äôs an interesting place to spend a day.",3.0
4445,An enjoyable place for kids,"Our family of 5 went there yesterday, on 04/08/13. We took advantage of the Ramadan Buffet offer and paid RM80.00 per adult and RM50.0 per child. We parked in Zone 3 and took a good 15mins to make our way to the ticketing counters. It's actually possible to do a ""drop off"" at the Mall of Medini, which is something to keep in mind with toddlers and the elderly. Some reviewers have implied that the mall is located away from Legoland. It's not. Rather, it forms the entrance of Legoland and one has to walk to the end of the mall to reach the ticketing counters. The mall itself has a fairly large selection of restaurants, with Asian, Japanese and Western selections. After entering Legoland, we decided to store some items in the lockers provided. Lockers come in 2 sizes. Full day for a small locker, which will fit 2 small knapsacks, costs RM20.00. Double that amount for a large locker. We rented the small locker for 3hrs. It cost us RM10.00. The lockers are interesting in that we have to use a vending style machine that offers no change. You can return to the locker several times within the rental period, key in your password and avail the contents, which is great if you need a change of clothes.Our initial impressions on entering the theme park were lukewarm, to say the least. The kids were not impressed either. The bright sun made the structures in Mini Land look dull and rough. However, we soon came to our first ride, the train, and the kids cheered up considerably. This was followed by a variety of rides, all of which seemed to be of short duration. Luckily, the queues were short too, and the rides were all of a short distance from one to the other, allowing a respite for the tired tiny feet.  When we reached the Dragon's Apprentice, our 3 and 5yr old chances upon a play area which was fashioned after a castle. That was enjoyable for them. The only complaint was the lack of benches for waiting parents. Now, one of the attractions of the Ramadan offer was its timing. In my opinion, 5pm onwards is probably the best time to venture into Malaysian playgrounds. So, we never got to experience the infamous heat of Legoland, but we did note the numerous trees and shaded areas available. I guess unless the whole place is converted into an indoor air conditioned zone, it's quite impossible to escape the full blast of the Msian mid-noon sun, umbrellas and hats notwithstanding. There are also plenty of vending machines and little stalls selling refreshments at reasonable prices as well. Many parents had brought simple snacks for their kids and the Legoland staff did not seem to mind. None of the rides we took seemed dangerous in any way. Some however were not suitable for those less than 4yrs. We went for the buffet dinner(inclusive of ticket charges) and the variety of the dinner spread alone was worth the cost of the admission tickets. Sadly, we vegetarians had lean pickings,  but that's how it usually is. Post-dinner, the kids had a brief spell of fun at the Shipyard, which is another play area for little ones. We finally left around 9pm after a brief visit to the loo. Clean but wet and not a place I'd want to shower and change. My initial impressions of the place? 3 stars. 2 reasons. The first and main one was the staff. Staff form a key component of theme parks. It would have been great to see friendly cheerful faces, clowning around with the kids. Instead most of the staff were shy and reticent. Perhaps the heat and fasting had sapped their energy. Fortunately, there were a few friendly staff, more so once night had fallen. The second complaint was the rides themselves. Short duration, lacking the wow factor and quite a few were not suitable for those under 4yrs. There were also a few incidences of jostling and queue cutting. Again, no staff to monitor the queues. Lastly, the admission cost itself. Unless your kids have Duracell bunny rivaling levels of energy, 4hrs of play time is about the limit. Paying the full fare is simply not worth it for that amount of play time although some may beg to differ. Perhaps, judicious planning and spacing of outdoor activities with indoor Lego building  activities, magic shows etc might do the trick if you plan to stay on for long. Despite our ""underwhelming"" experience overall, upon leaving the restaurant after dinner, we discovered that darkness had transformed the place. Liberal sprinkles of gentle twinkling lights lent a surreal appearance to the Mini Land and waterways. The kids too had become enchanted and refused to leave. We dragged them out and steered them clear of the huge Lego store near the exit. We will be back. Or so we promised the kids. All in all, a well deserved 4 stars, for a place worthy of at least one visit.",4.0
4446,AWESOME!!  And now with a waterpark and hotel next door!,"We had the best time at Legoland!  There was so much for our kids to do and plenty of age appropriate rides!We went during the week on a non school holiday and there was hardly anyone there.  No lines!!  We went to the right and circled the park stopping at all the fun rides along the way.  There were so many rides and play things for our kids to do.Our favorite was the dragon roller coaster towards the back of the park.  With no lines our son (age 4) rode the coaster about 10 times in a row.  Our daughter (age 5) loved the bigger coaster and with no lines was able to ride it about 7 times in a row.There is plenty of food and all reasonably priced.  Bring lots of water because it is hot!  There are lots of family friendly bathrooms too.Legoland has a new hotel opening by the end of the year.  This would be a perfect place to stay after a long day playing at the park.  And they are opening a water park either at the end of the year or beginning of next that will make a perfect place to cool off during the day!Our kids constantly talk about their fun day at Legoland.  Hopefully, we will be able to go again soon!TIPS:  1.  Go during week on non school holiday!2.  Avoid the roller coaster near the entrance.  The line is too long3.  Go right and head towards the back of the park.  No lines for those fun coasters!4.  Bring lots of water and snacks!5.  Go when they open because the day flies by.  This park is incredibly fun!6.  Perfect for younger kids.  Our kids were 5, 4 and 1 year old.This place is perfect for little kids!  I even loved riding the roller coasters with them!",5.0
4447,For Kids!,"The rides are mostly for kids, hence if you bring your toddler, he/she will definitely enjoy much of these. The 4d was not impressive, there was no motion at all! The theme park is good for Lego lovers, as it has an awesome Miniland! Miniland is a very nice depiction of asian countries especially India (Taj Mahal), China (Forbidden City), Cambodia (Angkor Wat), Thailand (Wat Arun?), Indonesia (Tanah Lot in Bali), Singpore (Merlion et al), and of course Malaysia (Petronas Twin Towers, Merdeka Square, Old KL Sentral, Putrajaya, Johor Bahru, et al), among others. All in all, the Lego figures are impressive and clear mirrors of patience and hardwork! Aside from the Miniland, I like the Einstein Lego, so cool! The themepark is reached 1hr by bus from JB sentral, and the challenge comes in going home for those taking the bus. There are no clear signs where to wait for the bus, or what time to expect it.  When the bus arrives, there is no proper dispatching of passengers. Since there's a lot of passengers waiting, everyone was bumping their way to get into the bus to secure a seat, which is a luxury after a day's walk under the hot sun (and also considering that the travel time is 1hr, no one would want to stand, right?). I hope this could be improved. Of course, you can always take a taxi or arrange a transpo at your hotel.It was very hot day when we visited and we were really sweating hard. Bring hats, and put on sunblock!",3.0
4448,Nice park but still not world class level. Rides mainly for young kids.,"1. Rides mainly for kids, limited rides are for young adults and adults.  2. Park is relatively small comparing to the likes of Disneyland or universal studio (can play all rides within 4 hours if no queue). Still some way to go to reach ""world class"" level. However overall experience are good, park is clean and organized. 3. Souvenirs are expensive, a key chain cost rm20, lego set are same price vs outside supermarket. Better wait for Jusco sales then buy, cheaper...:-)4. Bring umbrella, hot day as shade, rainy day as umbrella...limited covered area. 5. Miniland (landmarks made from lego) are impressive, worth to have a look. 6. It is worth visit if you are a lego fan, not so for others.",4.0
4449,Maximum pleasure for the family,"We came here just before 10.00am and our 2 boys were invited to do the countdown...a pleasant surprise! Although there was a slight drizzle early morning, the weather warmed up but it was still pleasant to walk about. We expected long queues and big crowd since it is Friday and so we absolutely delighted to experience all the rides without queueing. The pizza restaurant offers good pizza, the driving school was something cool for the kids and there Legoland staff were extremely helpful and friendly. We end up leaving at 7pm and bought some Lego souvenirs which were a bargain. Definitely one of the best theme parks in Asia!",4.0
4450,Good Fun,"I went on a weekday in the middle of the Singapore and Malaysia school semesters, so the park was very empty. The miniature displays in the middle of the park was really cool, with many of the world landmarks. Rides wise, the coasters are not too thrilling or scary, but more like enjoying some wind in your face. Since we went on such an empty day, we could even just change seats after riding the coasters and ride again right away! The food there is really expensive as you can expect from theme parks. The Lego toys in the gift shops were also really expensive, but there were quite a few interesting sets like the Star Wars Death Star. The weather was pretty fickle. In the morning, it was crazily hot, but in the afternoon, it rained pretty heavily. So remember to be prepared for this kind of weather changes. Overall, it was good fun, but nothing too exciting or thrilling.",4.0
4451,Awesome games but mostly kiddies !!!,"Hot sunny day, happen to have rain and the game starts. A little adventure kinds, fun, reminds your old days(kids) and water games are AWESOME !!! Its always better to avoid weekends, less queue and off course can play repeatedly :)",4.0
4452,Enjoyable for the kids,"Went thrice to this place. Compared to Universal Studio in Singapore, this place is suitable for kids who are afraid of heights. Not many shady place for us to rest. Not all rides are open. Food is very lousy. Tasted their spaghetti. Yucks! Half cooked!",3.0
4453,Not a bad place to bring the kids,"IMO I feel Legoland is more catered to the young kids. The kids will enjoy the rides and themes, but not so much for the adults.4D show is by far the lousiest I've seen. The 4th dimension in this case was apparently some winds and foam dropping on you.",3.0
4454,Hot without shelter,The weather is hot and humid. Not suitable for outdoor theme park. Lack of shelter. The place looks half built. Nothing much inside.  Not worth the entrance fee. Bring your own water. In an isolated corner in Johor Bahru.,2.0
4455,Fun trip for kids. Not so much for adults (unless you are parents),"For this review I will divide it into a few sections: (A reminder for the reader. I am a 21 year old Malaysian and I prefer adrenaline rushing rides so my review may be a bit biased against a theme park designed for children)1)AttractionsYes! Attractions! Who wouldnt want to enjoy the attractions if they are going to a theme park right? To be honest, most of the attractions are designed for young children. Adults wont really be impressed especially if you are seeking for adrenaline rush. (But hey, Legoland is for kids right? If you are a thrill seeker, I advise you to go to Universal Studios Singapore instead).Only a few of the rides are suitable for thrill seeking adults/teenagers. Most of the rides and attractions are alright but the audio system is terrible! Some of the audio system were too loud and crackled. Not very good for a famed theme park like legoland. Around the park, you can find various lego models. If you like to take photography, here is your chance. At the centre of the park, you can find various landmarks in Asia. The disappointment arise when I found out some of the landmarks were not well maintained. The boats and cars were not working properly. I hope the maintenance crew can do their job better.There was one particular attraction I felt very disappointed (other than the audio systems): The 4D cinema! The queue was horrible and disorganised. Everyone just waited and waited. We were not told when to go in or how long will it take. The show at the time was legend of chima. A very horrible experience. I personally do not appreciate the horrible storyline. The effects were good but not appropriate. 2) Souvenir shops and cafesIf you are a Malaysia, you would find the pricing very horrible and hard to swallow. A keychain costs RM20. Some of the lego models pricing were quite absurd. If you are a non-Malaysian and your currency is bigger then ringgit Malaysia then its okay. I never tried the food though but the price is quite a turnoff. 3)EnvironmentThe gardens and plants were well kept and beautiful. Very pleasing to the eye. However, since the park is quite new, the trees are not grown up yet. So better pray for a good weather. The sun can be quite punishing during a hot day. (I will advise bringing your own umbrella/parasol if you are going on a hot day. Bring your own raincoat/poncho too! A couple of attractions will make you wet, guaranteed!)4)Ticket priceThere are many promotions going on all year round. But I wont advise you to purchase an annual ticket. The attractions can be finished within 4 hours (provided the park is not crowded) and not really worth trying a second time UNLESS you are parents thinking of bringing your parents to go there once in a while during a year's time. In a nutshell, the attractions were fairly good and it is a good theme park for family-bonding. If you are parents, you can really consider bringing your children there. (Just a reminder, some of the rides require the child to be above a certain height. I cant remember the value butjust make sure they are tall enough if you want everyone to enjoy) I hope my review is has been helpful. Enjoy!",3.0
4456,Fun for preschoolers and primary,Been there many times as we have the annual pass. Kids enjoy it each time. Esp imaginarium section. Food quite nice and reasonably priced. We always eat at imaginarium as they serve pizzas and spaghetti which is just what d kids love. Surprisingly they serve better mushroom soup than pizza hut! Two things we don't really like is that they do not have enough shady places which is why we never stay the whole day cos too hot and the shows are just plain dull and boring... lack creativity.,4.0
4457,Lots of fun but subservient to weather conditions,"It is an ideal trip for families with children up to teenage years - lots of activities and food & beverage outlets.   The place is massive and one day is probably not enough to enjoy all it has to offer.  However, it is subject to weather conditions.  When it rains or when it is hot, it can be miserable as there is no shade to boast about.  Also, not a good idea to go during school holidays - there will be long queues at the food outlets (that leads to poor service) and at the gate entrance where everybody is waiting to go into Legoland.  Of course, complaints can be heard among many visitors that the food is really pricey.  It is not particularly friendly for old people as there is a lot of walking and there are no shaded seats in case they wish to sit down while the rest of the family play on.  I went there once and unless I have friends visiting who wants to go for the first time, I would go again. Legoland needs to improve further - make the place more navigable.  Have guides perhaps or have internal multi-seater buggies to give lifts to people instead of letting them walk.  One can get tired from queuing and walking before they get to enjoy the facilities.",3.0
4458,Continue to grow...,"They maintain the Theme Park well, with addtional of attraction in the Miniland...especially the World First Star Wars LEGO which display recently. It was a nice experience to see the models, and when you press the button, the LEGO model will move, sound and some actions within...",4.0
4459,Best attraction in Johor - for kids and playful adults,"If you happen to be in Johor (or Singapore) and have a half day, Legoland Malaysia is worth a visit. Beautifully done and maintained park, nice rides, lots of fun-stuff for kids mainly but it's really OK for adults too. Not too cheap, especially for Malaysia but if you buy the family ticket on-line, it's not that bad. You can buy tickets on their web-site, http://www.legoland.com.my.",4.0
4460,Excellent,We went during the Raya so the crowd was much lesser. Only singaporeans. The facilities are superb. Pls get tickets from agents as they give at 50% off. Do not go to the counters. Food is generally expensive. So try to get your own burger. The hot drinks are horrible. If you have children below 4 its a big disadvantage cause they cant go in many rides. So wait for your  kids to grow. Happened to me and I ended up going in all the rides alone. The brick slectiion is excellent in the Brick shop. You pick up what you want and they actually help you. A kg of bricks is 350RM. Its quite reasonable if you know what you want. The water slides are still under construction. So wait for 6 months if you want to take the complete advantage..Overall a fun experience. Get a map at the entrance and mark your way along. Otherwise you may miss out on some. I missed inspite of having the map cause I was exhausted. Happy holidays.. ,5.0
4461,Fun under the HOT sun.,"Well I have been to many theme parks around the world, so I think that's the reason why I was not too excited about this place. However for visitors who come down to almost dead town ( Johor) this will be a good escape to go on some of the rides as glance though the miniatures of the world wonders and etc. it's going to be really hot hot and hot so please be prepared with your shades cap and If possible a foldable umbrella. Even though its free for children bellow 2 it's advisable for them to pass on this as they can't go on many activities very limited activities for them. Children above 4 years old will enjoy this place. Have fun",3.0
4462,Great Trip,"My girls n i had a swell time going through the rides. Some were closed for repairs n the water park is still under construction...should be ready for early 2014.Things can be pricy for locals ( like me) esp when the kids want keepsakes to remember their trip. A keychain cost between RM10++ & RM 15. T shirts (simple) were minimum RM50++.Food n drinks cost a bomb. Its advisable to bring your own water, a floppy hat and a poncho. A simple poncho cost RM15++It would be good if there were more benches n rest spots in between rides. N some lower priced souveniors would be great!",4.0
4463,"Come one, Come all!","The first Legoland theme park in Asia which opened last September 2012. Located at the heart of Iskandar region with easy access from anywhere in Johor Bahru which is near Singapore. How to get there? If you will be coming from Singapore to Johor Bahru's Legoland it will take you 3 hours to travel by bus. They have so many buses operating everyday via their Causeway Link. A 76 acres them park loaded with whole day of fun filled activities for the entire families, along with over 40 great interactive rides, shows and attractions. Opens from 10am until 6pm most of the day. Longer opening hours apply on weekends from 10am until 10pm. Prices and tickets will depend on what package you will be getting. They have this day pass, family package and the annual pass (usually appiles to the people who frequent the theme park). You can save if you buy or book your tickets in advance. Although not totally finish yet because they are still building some added attractions plus the construction of the Legoland Hotel is still on going, there are a lot of other hotel accommodations that is affordable to choose from nearby that is if you want to stay for more than one day. But your whole day spent in the park i think would be enough to experience the beauty of the entire place. Restaurants and food booths are also available inside the Park. Just be sure to wear comfortable shoes because you will have to do a lot of walking and bring hats too as it is hot during the day trip. And the most important thing to bring is your camera, to capture every moment that you are going to spend in the Park. Surely kids and adults too will enjoy visiting the theme park.",4.0
4464,Lots of fun for kids in kindy or primary school!,"The Lego toy sets here sell for at least 10% less than on ebay (considering shipping charges, new, to this part of the world). The food is very average and the way they organise that pizza place they deserve to be shut down, but otherwise it's s fun place to be if you're a Lego fan or a young kid. Warning: can be hot and sunny! Bring cap and umbrella or just be prepared to sweat, it's ok, saunas are healthy ;)",4.0
4465,For big and small kids!,"Booked tickets online - there is a discount for purchasing tickets 7 days in advance through their website. How we got there: we arranged a taxi from the hotel in Singapore and the taxi too us to the customs border from Singapore and Malaysia. These aren't normal taxis, the only taxis that go to Malaysia are 'cross border' taxis. The taxi drivers arranged connecting taxi from Malaysia straight to Legoland. We only needed to change taxis once which was extremely safer and more convenient. The cost of both taxis was only S$70, if you are going as a group of 3 or 4 it works out cheaper to taxi than take the coach and no chance that your connecting coach will leave without you in Malaysia.Once we got there: It was amazing! It was everything I expected and more, I loved every part of the attraction. Remember to bring sunscreen and a hat, it can get very hot walking around. There isn't any currency exchange places near Legoland, but the attraction takes Singapore dollar and will give you change in Malaysian Ringgit which is very handy.There is also large, medium and small lockers for hire which are handy - BEWARE THESE MACHINES DON'T GIVE CHANGE. The largest locker can fit 3 standard sized carry on luggage, but will struggle to fit a normal sized check-in suit case. If this happens to you, go to customer service and they will hold onto the suit case for you, once they have checked that you have purchased a locker.All staff at Legoland are friendly and every ride you go to there is a professional photographer that will take your photo on your camera and on their cameras. You will get a card from the first photographer and once you get to the next photographer they will take your photo and then scan your card. At the end of the day you can give the card to the photolab and see all your photos taken during the day - VERY SMART! The best part of Legoland is miniland. These are iconic cities built form lego. It is amazing detail and absolutely wonderful.At the moment there is still construction on a Legoland resort next door, the sign I saw said opening in 2014 so I will definitely be back!",5.0
4466,Perfect day out for kids and for big kids at heart!,"I've been dreaming of visiting LEGOLAND since I was a small child and I had a wonderful day visiting Legoland today. There is plenty to see and do, as a solo adult I managed to get around everything in about six hours, including time to eat lunch, buy myself some souvenirs and some lego and also ride all of the roller coasters three or four times each plus the log flume ride twice. It was a little bit cooler today (got to 32 degrees), however it was certainly not hot in the park at all. If you get hot, go ride the log flume and get absolutely soaked!Despite what other people have said, I found that there is plenty of shady places available, it did rain for a period today however I was able to take shelter in a large number of places around the park. There are sun/rain shelters located throughout the park. I did have an umbrella and poncho with me, however i only used the umbrella to keep my camera dry. Food and drinks are expensive here, that I agree with wholeheartedly. I got here at bang on 10am and was able to view the mini monuments undisturbed and got on many rides without lines, in face I was able to stay on the Dragon roller coaster for four rides! If you don't want to spend a fortune on food and drink, eat at Mall of Medini before you come or after you've visited. There's KFC, Old Town White Coffee, a Pancake house, plus lots of other outlets for food and drinks, Souvenirs are expensive - bring cash. Lockers are available to rent in several places around the park, although most rides have places you can leave your bags. I also suggest you bring bottled water, umbrella, poncho, change of clothes (if you're doing the water rides like the log flume), sunscreen and comfy walking shoes. The park is pretty big!",5.0
4467,Fun for the whole family,My kids enjoyed the Legoland Malaysia and I have been there for at least 10 times since its opening. There are many rides and attractions to attract my kid. The 3D Movie theatre is one of their favourite. But there is not many shades in the park so do not go on a sunny day. You will be dehydrated and exhausted under the sunny day for 4 hours. It is best to go on a cloudy day if u are buying a day ticket.There are many new attractions coming up every 4 months to keep the park refreshing. But the show by the entertainers lack of depth and presentation when compared with Singapore Universal Studio.,4.0
4468,"""A must-visit for Lego fans""","Our family of 4 visited on a Friday and being Lego fans we all enjoyed the place.  However we ran into some major logistics problems with WTS travel, the main tour company that operates buses out of Singapore.  Before going I booked 4 seats via the Internet and the website was pretty user-unfriendly.  I then decided to call them, and unsurprisingly no one picked up the phone.  In the end I managed to book seats for the 9:30 departure as this is the most suitable time, with expected arrival in about one hour or just after the park opens.  We arrived at the Singapore flyer, the departure point, at 9 to find a large crowd and absolutely no organization of lines whatsoever.  So we ended up lining up for 15 minutes inside the WTS office only to discover that we should have lined up outside instead.  After departing from the flyer, we arrived at the Singapore customs, got off, cleared it, got on the bus again and then cleared the Malaysian border.  At that point we wasted an hour as the bus didn't move onto Legoland.  Apparently every bus in Malaysia which is not classified as an ""express"" bus needs a guide and ours was nowhere to be seen, arriving one hour late.  When she did arrive there were no apologies either.  The ironic thing is that it would only take another 15 minutes to arrive at Legoland so we wasted an hour for this invaluable guide to do nothing except sit with us for 15 minutes.So we arrived at the park at around 11:30 and decided to have lunch at a food park which was just opposite the entrance.  They have Burger King and KFC and others and yes the food is significantly cheaper than inside the park.  Once inside the park, you can tell that it is new as the trees as still young and small, but luckily it was a cloudy day for us and there is plenty of shade.  We went on a lot of the rides with our kids starting at the Driving School at Lego City, the Land of Adventure ride firing blasters from a car, the Dragon ride at Lego Kingdom, amongst others. Don't miss the 4D Lego Chima show and Mini Land which has great picture-taking opportunities with Asian landmarks all made from Lego.  In the end we stopped at the Big Shop where you can find everything Lego, and we spent a lot of money there! On the way back the trip was smooth and we left on the 5:15.  Traffic heading into Singapore was quite bad so we arrived at the flyer near 7pm.  Overall the park is worth the trip for young kids and all Lego fans, but beware of logistics.",4.0

4471,Great day out!,"I was extremely excited about visiting LegoLand and I wasn't disappointed.  The trip is almost worth it for the minature cities/buildings section alone.  The work and accuracy that has gone into those constructions is incredible.  There are some fun rides (the log flume is great - be prepared to get SOAKED!) although don't expect Universal Studios-type stuff.  That's not what this place is about.  I cannot understand reviews on here which complain about either 1) The Heat or 2) the lack of shade.  1) It's southern Malaysia - what do you expect?? and 2) There is loads, so that's just not true.  I had a blast but some the waterpark and hotel are still not open.  I suspect I will be the first to give LegoLand a full 5 stars once the waterpark is open.  Bring it on!",4.0
4472,It's really hot,"Have a chance to visit because have to accompany my relatives; so after about 10 months since its opening, I visit this place with my reluctance.The general comment is it's really hot. The place is such as playground at the arab desert; it was sunny day (early July 2013) and yet almost no trees.The playground is big enough, but the rides is so ‚Äòdry‚Äô for the parents, and yet not so memorable by the kids. My kids just mention the driving school only. Of course, its because he got a driving license for 25 RM.It is too early to say I will not go there again, because the place is still developing for more attraction. But for now, I can say enough.",3.0
4473,good for 1 visit only,"like - if you're a lego fan, then you're in the right place. the place is colorful, w/ various lego murals all around the parkdislike - poor transportation to/from the park. minimal bus plying the routes between legoland & JB Sentral",3.0

4475,Sunnyside Up,"Before anybody steps into Legoland...you need 4 VITAL things.1) Sunblock of the strongest kind2) Gallons of water3) Money4) Hat And if you have a child who is below 3, please be patient and wait till he/she reaches at least 5 or 6 years of age.  Yes...the rides were fun. And boy, if you were to spend the whole day there....that would have been your aerobics and walk fitness workout.  Everything in legoland it overpriced.  From a bottle of mineral water to the souveniers! Imagine  buying a legoland Tshirt for RM 89.90 or a cap for RM 69.90.I think its a really nice park...no complaints.  Just be prepared to really sweat your body out.  And if you have any children below the age of 3, please don't torture yourself.  I had a 5 year old and a going to be 3 year old.  So apart from hoping onto every ride with my 5 year old, I had to explain to my teary eyed going to be 3 year old that he just could not go on the ride.  Imagine having to explain that at least 10 times!!!!  So...parents with children, be patient and wait it out.",3.0

4479,Must visit if you have young kids,Hired a car and driver from singapore ($300 SGD) through the hotel and was at Legoland in about 80 minutes. This is a better option if you want to go with your own schedule and past through customs quickly instead of a tour bus. The driver dropped us off and then picked us up at the agreed time. We were there at opening time (10am) and got picked up at 4 pm. We could've stayed longer! The boys 3 and 9 loved it. Luckily for us it wasn't too hot. Lots of things to do and see.,5.0
4480,Big and fun,"We travelled from Singapore to Malaysia just for a daytrip to LegoLand.  We hired Porter express to take us and the driver waited for us and was basically there to take us where we wanted. that worked well for us.We took our four children to LegoLand, and had a wonderful day. We found that our youngest couldn't go on many rides as he was only 80cm in height, but our other three children loved it. The park is big, and very clean.lots of rides and attractions to keep the kids busy. We got there at approx 10am and our driver had planned to pick us up at 4pm to take us to hello kitty land and little big town. We still missed a bit of the park in this time. There are lots of food outlets at reasonable prices. Make sure you have the sunscreen handy and a hat. I found there were lots of areas to sit and wait for the kids and hubby under shade.",5.0
4481,Perfect for young explorers,"We visited this park because our kids love Lego bricks and play with it almost everyday. And yes, our 10 years and 6 years old kids were very exciting with this park. They did not get bored from 10 am to 8 pm. Actually the rides are really kids friendly, very suitable for young ages, even the roller coaster. During our visit, fortunately the park wasn't too crowded so we could ride the same ride for a couple of times without queuing. But there was a big and heavy rain for about one hour and we got stuck in an attraction, so we just played about 5 times more while waiting for the rain to stop. But for adults who are looking for a challenging attraction, I'm affraid you will not get it here because this park is designed for the young explorers.",5.0
4482,Great fun!,Kids loved it but the young ones might need to be at least 1.3m tall to fully enjoy the experience as a lot of the rides have a height requirement. The f & b is presentable and cost is reasonable for a place like that.,4.0
4483,Fantastic Land!,"We took the Legoland 2D/1N package with Pulai Spings Resort. Great value because the rate includes tickets for 4 to Legoland. (Tickets can be used for either 4 adults or 2 Adults & 2 Children)Legoland is really great fun especially if you enjoy Lego bricks. It's not a park for big thrilling rides.  It's a place to enjoy the creativity and simply the bricks itself. I grew up playing with Lego and now my children love creating with Lego. That's the only reason we went.  There are rides too,  but they are only there to complement the park.The mini land is great! All the famous places and buildings looks exactly like the real thing except they're miniature. For the children aged 8 and above,  if they're interested in Lego Minestorm, be sure to register to participate in the scheduled session.The brick shop is brilliant! You can pick any bricks like you're picking lollies and buy them by weight.Only one suggestion, perhaps the  management of the shop could place an extra scale near the brick boxes so that people don't have to go back and forth near the check out counter to weight the bricks that they've picked. Overall,  it's a great day out for the family. ",5.0
4484,"Mainly kiddy rides, no shelter when it rains","This theme park is suited to children aged below 12 years old. Older children and adults will feel bored, especially if you are a thrill seeker looking for exciting rides.There are not many sheltered areas in the park so you will get wet when it rains unless you hide inside a shop or restaurant.",3.0
4485,Good Fun for Young Kids,"Great Park for 4-10 year olds. The roll-coaster rides were quite kids' friendly and kids will enjoy them. The driving school was also a favorite amongst the children. On the activities front, if there are no long queues, it should be completed within a day. On off-peak days, you could conceivably complete the park within 4-5 hours. Within the park, it serves the typical theme park food with some local twist. You could have your dinner just outside the park. There a few restaurants available including fast food joints such as Burger King and KFC. I would encourage families to bring your own ponchos if it rains and also for one of the water-based rides ( otherwise you will need to buy one there or bring a change of clothes ). I thought the Lego products there were pricer compared to departmental stores. Check the web-sites for deals on tickets as there could be bigger discounts available.",4.0
4486,Nice theme park,"Legoland Malaysia provides some entertaining rides and attractions but a major draw still has to be the huge Lego structures especially the miniature cities made entirely out of Lego blocks. The upcoming addition of water rides and attractions should make the park even more entertaining. A good destination for families. The downside to a trip to Legoland is the travel back to Singapore. Long queues at the Singaporean immigration facility were an inconvenience. It took us 30 minutes just to be processed. Just the same, Legoland Malaysia tour is a good sidetrip to a Singapore weekend.",3.0
4487,best day ever..,"we took the tour bus from singapore flyer up to Legoland..it was scorching hot then it rained endlessly..Need to bring fans,umbrella and pochos..The exhibits were spectacular..we stayed for most of the day..The 4D cinema is good but the queue is so long..The toilets were slippery as they have bidets on them..There are alot of food choices and they accept singapore $.

4488,Great experience!,"I went with my 7-year nephew and niece and they both enjoyed it a lot! The attractions are different; very interesting and creative, compared to other theme parks. Definitely a must-go place when you have kids. When we went there, it was not that busy, so we could ride the attractions for couple times in a row without waiting for that long. We took the coach bus from Singapore. The bus left from Singapore flyer in the morning and took us at Legoland and it dropped us back at Singapore Flyer in the evening. You have to buy the coach bus ticket at least 2-day in advance. They have a package ticket (coach bus + admission ticket to Legoland -check the Legoland Website for the coach information and where you can buy it). We bought the ticket online at Sistic (it costs 2 SGD more per ticket) but it was easier than to go to the ticket box especially if you do not live in Singapore. Then we picked up our ticket at the SISTIC authorised agent.",5.0
4489,Fun attractions but hot venue,"You'll be amazed to find the entire theme park surrounded by things built on, what else, Lego!

Don't go there looking for thrill rides because you won't find any.Legos to buy are very expensive to buy - don't know why exactly. Entrance is fair priced, if you intend to go twice get the annual pass. Staff very friendly.

4493,A new attractions place but dull,"Ok, it's new ....it's lego land but it's probably better if they put more songs that are more cheerful for kids....not those club lounges songs. They need to put more lego characters in throughout the lego land so that more kids can take picture with more lego characters and not having to wait for a long period of time to just take a picture with only 1 character of Lego (located just right after the entrance door). They should install water spraymist in all throughout the Lego land...because lego land should know that it's hot in malaysia and there are hardly any shades and it is impossible to move out one place to another without getting any sunburn.",3.0

During the holiday season, the place very crowded, queue is to long, take over 20 minutes for playing around 3 minutes. The prayer room is dirty and no air condition or fan. ",3.0
4497,Sunburn City,"Legoland has the potential to be a great place for family entertainment, but they need to re-think the design of the park to suit the climate.  There are some good rides for primary school aged children and great displays of lego models, the only problem is there is barely any shade in the entire park and it is next to impossible to move around or get on the rides without getting sunburnt. Some more adventurous rides for teens and adults are needed. The lego models are located in a central outdoor area where the sun reflects off the concrete and the shiny plastic bricks to intensify the heat.  The exhibit desperately needs shade. There is also a hotel and a water park under construction.All the staff we met spoke English and were polite and helpful.  We were particularly impressed when the staff made room in the busy air conned cafe to set up an extra table and chairs indoors so that we could escape the heat.If you are visiting Singapore you can catch a bus from the Singapore Flyer (near Marina Bay) to Legoland.",3.0
4498,Malaysia : LegoLand,"For overseas tourists wanting to go to Lego land, please do note that it is NOT in Kuala Lumpur (it is 6 hours bus ride from KL). Weather is the killer - even under clouds, the sun can be punishing and the humidity makes life a little more uncomfortable for everyone. Suggest that you come prepared with HATs, Caps, umbrellas etc. Dress for summer. Bring lots of mineral water for everyone. Remember, this is park for everyone and things are expensive by Malaysia Standards. Try to plan to go to the place early in the morning hours or later in the afternoon (@3pm). Or you can go there for lunch before starting off venturing in the park. There is a mini mall outside of the park and I suggest you eat at the mini mall before going in - seems the price of meals are cheaper than inside the legoland. Carry the minimum load if possible, because there is hardly any shelter in the grounds. I wish the mgmt could build some rest areas with air conditioning. it will really help everyone to take a short break and be more comfortable before embarking for the next ride or place. The place is relatively new and the trees around are very young and offers little to no shelter at all. Wheel chairs are available on first come, first serve basis. I like the layout & design but I felt the place has very little excitement for the kids.. although there are rides etc.. it just does not have much compared to say, Universal Studio. looking back, i think for foreigners travelling to this location, it would be better if you took the tour buses. if you are going to Leog land from Singapore, the immigration checkpoint can be jammed for a couple of hours or more. BUt if you take tour buses, they have a separate check in area and the immigration checkpoint is much faster to process your passport. after a hard, hot & muggy day out, let the tour bus take you back with you having to be concern about the drive back. I went on a saturday and it took us less than 1 hour to pass thru Singapore & Malaysia checkpoints. I like to suggest that you plan your trip for early morning or late afternoon so it would not be so hot. the park closes at 10pm. Recommedations: 1. Hats, Caps, Umbrellas & suntan lotion. Sunglasses is optional2. Carry Lots of mineral water bottles for everyone - and drink regularly.3. Extra change of clothes for the kids. 4. Travel by Tour bus. but there is a large car park area if you want to drive. 5. IF you travel by Tour Bus, make sure you are 15 mins early for your ride back. I am not sure how hot HELL is but this place can be very hot & Humid and its a struggle with every step you take.",3.0
4499,Very hot,"For a person who have been to numerous Disneyland, Disneysea, Universal Studios, Movie World, Sea World, Ocean Park, and many others, I consider this an average. However things many be different once their water park is completed and more activities and rides are implemented. And because it is still relatively new, the foliage are still young thus it is very hot. Remember to bring a cap or umbrella with you.",3.0
4500,nice and Now crowded,We have been in legoland Malaysia one week ago and it's perfect for kids between up to 12 years old. The rides are not that thrilling but perfect for kids.We enjoyed the day as there was no many people in the park!Food is available and affordable :)Perfect day.,5.0

4503,Worth it if you have an extra day,"This is a theme park located in Malaysia, and since it is located in Johor Baru, supposed to attract Singaporeans but majority of the visitors (at least when I was there) were Indonesians.  Nice theme park area if you have pre-teenager kids, as they will be thrilled by the attractions and the Lego builds.  It was recently open so the attractions and the Lego buildings are still fresh.I visited there on Monday on the first day of school for Singapore, so it is very not crowded.  We arrived around 10:30, and by the time we left around 5:30, we got to experience all the rides and attractions at least once.  Some of the rides had no queue at all, as soon as we got off one, we could get on the next one.  Coming back from Disneyworld last year where we had to plan all the rides, this one is truly relaxing.On the down side, there is not much rides that you can enjoy.  However, there are many Lego builds that will entertain your kids for sure.  Ticket price is rather steep considering the area, which is coming to about US$40-US$45.  Also, it is located in Johor Baru, so you have to consider the transportation time and cost as well to get there (from Singapore it is about 1.5 hours one way and another SGD 20).",3.0
4504,A Lego lovers big day out.,"We did a day trip from Singapore to Legoland yesterday with our 2 Lego lovers. It was a huge, tiring, very hot but  totally amazing day for them.Travel- prebooked and paid online with WTS travel. All went smoothly, correct amount charged to credit card and all in order when we reached bus pick up point at Singapore Flyer. Remember to take your passports as you need to do border crossing into Malaysia and pen to fill out immigration cards on the way back into Singapore. This is a little time consuming making the trip around 1.5 hours each way as you need to get on/ off bus twice in both directions. WTS travel has your Legoland tickets ready for you so no queuing needed when you reach the park.Take- hats, sunscreen,water( although available throughout the park for purchase) and small snacks if your kids get the munchies per meals like ours.Busy- no the park was quite quiet when we visited on a Monday. (Check local school holiday dates) this worked beautifully as the kids could pop off a ride they liked and get straight back on with NO queues-amazing!Food outlets- are plentiful we chose poorly and ended up with an inedible chicken burger(not the  juicy specimens pictured on the  menu but some strange put together ?? chicken product) .French fries were fine.The BIG shop- sadly probably the highlight for our kids. The biggest Lego shop in Asia ( per Legoland website) had a great choice and prices ok ( for Australians - about the same as Target prices when Lego not on special but far superior range). Lego mini figures very reasonsble and an amazing array of Lego keychains.When it got too hot and we were all tired we sat in the air conditioned area and built Lego.Our only mistake of the day was starting to the left of the park when we arrived. This took us into areas the boys were less interested in. If you turn right after entry, just past the Big shop, you arrive straight into Lego city that was our kids favourite area. They drove cars, boats, aeroplanes, put out a fire with a  parent propelled fire engine. They also loved the area next to this ( Land of adventure) where they went on the lost kingdom adventure ( riding while laser shooting "" awesome Mum"") and Beetle bounce 3 times. Build and test in Imagination area was also a highlight for 8 year old.Are kids are not thrill seekers and were either too small ( or scared) to go on some of the more sophisticated rides.",4.0

4506,The theme park for the kids,"We went via private transfer from Singapore to Legoland on the weekend of 15 June 2013. This was our first time at Legoland and I must say it was rather enjoyable, especially for the kids.  We were the from 10.30am to 5pm and we didn't manage to take all the rides although we did take repeat rides of the Dragon, Aqua racers etc. There wasn't much of a crowd which was surprising. Even when we had to queue it was only for 15 mins at most?  The Lego creations peppered around the park were fantastic though and I could only imagine the amount of work put into the Miniland. It was definitely hot in the park with little shelter but luckily the ride queues were sheltered. We will probably come back again,  maybe when the hotel and water theme park are ready (construction underway for the hotel and water theme park when we were there).",4.0
4507,"Singapore to Legoland, Malaysia with WTS Travel","A few pointers for travellers wishiing to do a day trip from Singapore to Legoland. We are a family with 3 kids aged 9, 6 & 4. With only limited time in Singapore we booked a day trip to Legoland online before leaving Australia (which included our travel to/from our hotel to Legoland).A few companies can do a travel/entry package and we went with the cheapest and then chose the company that had a bus leaving closest to our hotel. Singapore Flyer was only a 20-30min walk from The Fullerton Hotel so we went with WTS Travel.  http://legoland.wtstravel.com.sg/Ticketing was easy online and you just show them your printout receipt. We chose the 8:30am bus and although you'll read about ""Legoland is only 45mins from Singapore"", once you stop to exit Singapore Customs, then drive over the bridge to go through Malaysian Customs, you wont reach Legoland until 10am (when it opens).Make sure you get to WTS Travel at Singapore Flyer no later than 15mins before departure!!! We did and our bus left 5 minutes later (10 mins before scheduled departure) at 8:20am.Getting home from Legoland took just as long. WTS have many scheduled departing services to/from Legoland but they fill up quickly. Our choices coming home were 4:15pm or 7:15pm. We chose the latter and were very glad. Legoland was crazy busy at 10am. By 4pm you could get on any ride with less than 5mins wait.We made the mistake by racing over to ""Project X"" rollercoaster. We got in to line and it said the wait was 15mins. After 10mins, the line was double so we thought we had done well. After 45mins the kids were getting bored. We were very near the start so we waited. Just as we got to the gates to enter the Project X cars, they had mechanical failure. We patiently waited another 20mins. Finally I asked how long before the ride is fixed and we were told 50-60mins. Then we left (along with countless others). No sooner had we exited the ride area, my son pointed out that the ride was up and running. D'oh! We went back after 4pm and rode again and again without any queues. Best to leave the popular rides for much later in the day.A warning for people with toddlers: Although some rides state a minimum height, they also have age restrictions. Being a minimum of 6 was a requirement for quite a few rides so my 4.5 year old had to miss out on a number of rides we expected him to be allowed on as he was tall enough. There are adventure playgrounds and rides for smaller children.A water park is currently being built. Not sure when it is expected to be finished. Our kids still got soaked from a water fountain area, (meant fo playing in) and if required, they have these huge walk-in drying machines (extra charge 10 ringgit). My kids just dried naturally. If you are VEGETARIAN at Legoland your choice is limited. We were surprised at this in Malaysia. The only place that offered vegetarian was ""Market Restaurant"". Our only choice was a curry with rice (24 ringgit). Our kids got a kids meal (fish fingers, ribena drink, cup of fresh fruit) for 15 ringgit. Water bottles are 2.50 ringgit. My kids wouldn't eat much of the fish fingers, not very good but I'm yet to come across good kids' food at a theme park.Best part of Legoland was ""Mini Land"". If it's not hot, one could spend hours exploring these amazing lego buildings. Best advice, spend a whole day so you can take it slowly and stop and rest. Hope the info in my review helps someone in some way.",4.0
4508,Fantastic place if not crowded,Was a great place to visit if the theme park is not crowded. We went there on the day before Malaysian National Election. This was the second time we visited the park since we've the annual ticket. The first time we visited was a nightmare. But the second time we went was really great as no crowd. The kids was having fun as each ride they manage to ride 3 times.,4.0
4509,A great day with the family,"This is a wonderful place to keep the kids occupied for the entire day. We were lucky that the weather was fairly cool and the park was relatively empty (midweek, just after the malaysian school holidays). This allowed us to try practically every ride thats available, save for the two ""adult"" coasters (The Dragon & Project X) and we spent our time at a leisurely pace (8.5 hours). I suppose not having to queue more than 10 minutes for any given activity (on some rides there were no queues at all!) made things all the more pleasant.In terms of pricing, I'd say its a mixed bag. Tickets to the park are reasonable. We booked online, direct from their website for 2 adults and 2 kids for a fixed day pass and paid RM400. Lunch at Knight's Feast was 2 sausage set meals (adult) and a chicken nugget set meal (kids) set us back by RM55 - still reasonable by theme park standards. It started to pour during lunch so we got ourselves a golf brolly from one of the few stores dotted around the park. Unfortunately it was a poorly constructed souvenir and paying RM80 for it was poor value for money. A kiddie drivers license from the Driving School, RM 25. Steep.There are 2 retail outlets (The Big Shop & The Brick Shop) flanking the entrance of the park and honestly, though the range was decent, I had expected more. If you are a hardcore lego junkie, you'll be seriously disappointed.",4.0
4510,Great park for young children,There are a number of rides that are suitable for kids as even the roller coasters are not dangerous. The souvenir shops offer wide range of Lego sets. There is even a corner where kids can customize their Lego figurines with mix and match parts from several trays. Special discounts are offered to annual pass owners. Restaurants also offer kids meals of different kinds. Preferable to go in the morning as the afternoon scorching sun can be a challenge for some. Holiday crowds will also mean longer queuing times for rides.,3.0
4511,Funtastic place for whole family,"its well maintained, good layout, fun to be with small and big kids. they have separate areas for small and grown up kids. we wait for its water kingdom to start and will definitely visit again.",5.0
4512,Not Recommended for Adults,"I went here with my cousin on a Wednesday noon and I don't think it was worth the money, effort and time. The life-sized legos are quite cool at a near distance but they're not that cool to look at from afar. I felt bad at the effort spent trying to build all those legos when people could hardly appreciate how intricate and delicate the whole process was. Another reason why I wouldn't recommend this place for travelling adults is because you only need 2 hours at the most to see all the attractions. I advise that you visit after 3pm so that by 5pm, you could go back to Singapore on the same route going here. Highlight:The only attraction at this place that I enjoyed is the Miniland in the middle area of the theme park. The miniature structures made up of legos were quite awesome. I took a lot of pictures of the legos because that's the only way I could make up for the lost time, money and effort in coming all the way here from Singapore. We weren't able to try the 4D ride because we assumed that it was as boring as the first few ordinary rides we tried.Rides:It was the first time I didn't scream in a roller coaster ride. The rides are definitely FOR KIDS ONLY. I suddenly wished my 5-year-old nephew was with me that time. I'd say Enchanted Kingdom and Star City have much better rides. Weather: Scorchingly hot. I think we got an extra amount of tan within a 2-hour stay. We didn't have either an umbrella or sun block with us that time. I wasn't really able to appreciate all kinds of amusement set up around us because of the humid feeling.How to go to Legoland:If you didn't avail a shuttle service, this is one way of public transport. From Jurong East Bus Interchange (near East West green train line - Jurong East Station) in Singapore, you can ride the Causeway Link CW3 or CW4 Bus to CIQ 2nd link, where you will have to undergo the Malaysian Immigration. Before you reach the CIQ 2nd Link, you'll have to have your passport stamped by the Singapore Immigration first. Remember to go as fast as possible so that your bus seats wouldn't be taken by other passengers who went first. From CIQ 2nd Link, you'll have to transfer to the JPO2 bus which will directly take you to Legoland.Going Back to Singapore:This was the most inconvenient part of our trip. We were forced to take a different route going back because we finished by 2pm and needed to go back to Singapore before 6pm. The Causeway Link JPO2 buses were scheduled to go back to CIQ 2nd Link at 5pm. So we took the Causeway LM1 bus to JB Sentral, and from there we had our passports stamped by the Malaysian Immigration and finally rode the SBS Transit Bus numbers 160 or 170 all the way to Kranji MRT (North South red train line) station. At some point on the way going back to Singapore, you'll have to get off the bus to have your passports stamped by the Singapore Immigration. Again, try to go as fast as possible so you won't be left behind by the same bus where you got off.",2.0
4513,Great theme park for family,"Situated in a bit far from JB downtown, this theme park offers various kind of 'playground' for kids, teenagers and parents/adults.

4517,I want to move to Lego Land !! What a lovely world !!,"Unforgettable experience !!! No cue for buying the tickets; not as huge as thematic parks used to be, wide spaces with toilets easy reachable all over the park; playgrounds all over, just for kids to run around, slide, hide and climb; plenty of foods stalls, and drinks with pretty healthy selections, btw. Rides for the littles ones (kids over 3 years they will have a lots of fun), as well as for older ones, and for parents like me with little kids inside ;-). Rooms with air conditioned just to sit down and play with bricks and more ""advanced things"" for the older kids; awesome friendly staff; not waiting time at any ride; some nice refreshing ""water rides"" and they have also sort of body dryer where you can fit in and dry yourself afterwards. Price of the food is quite normal and you have also a lot of options outside (sort of shopping mall). You need to have sunscreen, hats / umbrella and keep yourself hydrated. If you by the pictures they take during the ride you can also download a soft copy in the website afterwards (cool thing). The miniland is amazing !!! you can spend hours enjoying every single detail. In one word ... Fantastic !!!",5.0
4518,A land of Lego and joy,We have now been to LEGOLAND in Malaysia twice. It is a favorite place for both our kids aged 3 and 6. Here are my top 10 tips when visiting:1. Come early. There is less queues and you get to try more activities.2. Go for the rides first and then take a break from the rides after lunch to wonder around the miniland exhibits. It is really nice how a landmark from a country can be build in Lego to look so real.3. It is possible to eat lunch in the park or go outside to the nearby mall to eat.4. Go on a day where there are some clouds. It can become really hot otherwise.5. Build your own Lego car. This can be a family competition to see who can build the fastest car. There is a test track for you to try out your constructions.6. Go for the Clutch powers 4-D movies. They are really cool.7. Try the fire brigade and compete with other families... 8. Let your kids mix a bag of Lego before you leave. It is around USD 15 per 100g but it is fun for the kids to find small parts they do not have.9. Let your kids get a drivers license. It can be used at other Legolands too.10. Eat a relaxing dinner before leaving. The mall outside has a few good places.My kids always fall asleep on the way back to Singapore. They only do that when they have had too much fun.I hope you have fun at LEGOLAND. I also suggest that you consider the first LEGOLAND in Denmark. I used to go there when I was a little boy.,5.0
4519,Nice!,Did enjoy the theme park with my 2half years old son. It's new and find the games and choices they offer cover all level of age.good facilities and their restaurant did offer a wide variations of choices at a reasonable price.,5.0
4520,Good place for fmaily and freind,"Legoland was a good place for family but the need to improve with landscapping, more greens and better place for public to rest under the hot suunny sun or rain.  Parking area should be tared and more restaurant to serve the local comunitty with is more economical. Foor price in Legoland is so expensive i think Iniversal Studios is cheaper. Expedite on the hotel and other dacility as it prety boring for audutls. ",3.0
4521,Hot but good fun,"Went there on a Friday during Singapore school holiday. Not many people, waiting time for the rides took less than 10 minutes. The boys had a blast. Beside the standard rides, they have block building activities (air con rooms!) which the boys enjoyed very much. There are also a couple of playgrounds for kids to roam freely. Ideal for kids 5-12 years old in my opinion.It's a hot place and there are no water coolers in the park. Bottled water cost US$1. Re entry is permitted once. More choices of food outside. Worth the trip.",4.0
4522,Fantastic!,"We were there on 17 June 2013 and the crowd is not really overwhelming. Though we booked our tickets online in advanced, there were no long queues at the ticketing counter. Or maybe we reached there pretty early.The park is huge. There are stroller n wheelchair rentals for those who didn't bring their own. Most rides are suitable for kids. There are also rides for kids 3yrs old and below with and without supervision but not many. My 3yr old daughter had fun nonetheless. There are ample playgrounds for her to climb here and there. We stayed there from opening till closing and we still have rides that we did not try.Waiting time for the rides took less than 10mins. Maybe this is due to a Monday and also the haze. It was well worth it. Staffs are friendly. Though there are not enough shady areas, there are ample eateries for coffee and food breaks. There are also indoor places where kids can sit and play with LEGO bricks.Should you plan to visit, do remember to bring sunblock, umbrella or hat to protect you and your family from the sun. Food and drinks are not overly priced so you need not bring your own food and drinks in.Definitely looking forward to visit LEGOLAND MALAYSIA again.",5.0
4523,Discount to legoland,"Went to legoland during the worst of the haze that Singapore was experiencing,so was not at all crowded,no lineups for rides at all .some  rides were closed ,but reopened later on in the day which was fine.could do with more shelter around the mini land area. Plenty of food choicesWe discovered discounted ticket coupons (40 ringit) if you purchased a bottle of sprite at the convenience store located just to the left of the entry,the shop will let you pick up later.i don't know how long this offer will go for,we purchased 3 bottles 4ringit each,and saved 120r.Overall we would return again,rides were perfect for our 7 year old .",4.0
4524,Not to miss this one,"We specially went to Johar Baharu for our kids to visit Legoland. It was a great unforgettable experience. My wife says it is better than the Disney land of Hong Kong. Very new and unique events and games for kids. The Roller Coaster , my first time, was scary but they are meant to be so. The food is good and very reasonably rated. Thanks to legoland. Very Good ice creams. Few water games as well. And a revolving watchtower. So much we could not cover in 1 day. You can hire strollers for babies or your backpacks.",5.0
4525,Legoland great adventure for kids,We enjoy our time visiting legoland johor bahru malaysia. Many playground for our 8th and 12th years old kids. And the replica of many beatiful country was very great to cached pictures. We had a very fun time with our fam. But the weather was very hot you must bring sunblock or hat or umbrella with u. There are many pollutant air this days because of the smoke from trees burning. So maybe you better comeback later.,4.0
4526,Excellent theme park if your kid is about 4 to 7 years old,"We brought our 5 years old kid.  He just super loved it.  He almost played most of the rides, even for the roller coaster.We spent a full day there from 10 to 7pm (For some days, it opens from 10am to 8pm).  The food is relatively good as being a theme park.  Though there is air pollution with some haze.  According to the taxi driver, it's because of some businessmen burnt the forest in Indonesia for land to develop.  Overall speaking, the theme park is worthwhile to go.  And the LEGOLAND hotel will be completed in the coming few months.  Suggest to stay there as it is a bit hard to get a taxi when you leave at the peak hours.",5.0
4527,Good for kid but unlikely to revisit,"Many rides which seems like the copy of many of the Disney or USS attractions. My small kid enjoyed the many playground there but unlikely to return for a second visit, it is like been there, done that but no special reason to return.",4.0
4528,Malaysian Theme Park,"Cons:1. Most rides are kiddy rides. Even the most thrilling ride is not really thrilling. But it is good if you have younger kids (but not too young as you need to be at least 120m to ride most rides)2. The weather! - is very Malaysian. Hot and humid. My best friend that day was my wide brim sunhat and shades. Also I made a mistake by wearing long sleeves (wanted to avoid getting tanned) because it made me sweat buckets!Pros:1. Food is quite cheap and good considering it is inside a theme park. 2. Great if you are not into rides - there are lots to see and take pictures of.3. Great for shopping Lego related stuff4. Of all the theme parks I've been to, this has the least crowd and hence the shortest queues. Getting there: It takes about 1 hour from JB SentralBy bus. RM4.50 from JB Sentral. We took the 9:30am bus but there are other timings as well. By cab. Coming back from Legoland to JB Sentral was about RM70 by taxi meter. I would say it is just OK, and it is a 'been there, done that' thing for me.",3.0

The park is also small and my family completed the whole theme park with many repeated rides within four hours.I was a bit disappointed with the Mini-world which turns out to be a Mini-Malaysia.  I was expecting a Lego mockup of attraction from many nations. Overall, it is still a good place for young family.",3.0
4533,A Great Outing,We spent a full day in this place with our 6 years old daughter. This place fitted in well for all ages and we were  impressed with all the Lego themes site. It was my daughter's first time on a roller coastal and she love it. The miniland representing the Asean historical iconic buildings were so detailed and real. We went into the 4D studio and experience the 3D movie with snow shower. It was something we never expected. The Lego tower was worth going to see the whole theme park from the top. My daughter had her first experience in Nissan car driving school and was taught on traffic rules. The whole visit was really great as it involves learning and enjoyment.,4.0

Directions to different places of interest in the park are quite clear on the map given to each visitor.,3.0
4536,Legoland Malaysia,"I went to Legoland with my family last Sunday. The weather was good that day. It is advisable to wear sunblock, bring umbrellas and bring water.We bought the Legoland Advanced 1 Day Pass with 20% off. Original price is RM140 for Adults and RM110 for senior citizens. Parking is RM7 for more than 4 hours. We parked at Zone 3.My sister and I tried the Lego Technix roller coaster ride. It was good and quite thrilling with extreme speeds downhill and cornering. I bought the photo taken during this ride for RM30. For the more adventurous, you should try The Dragon. at the Lego Kingdoms.This is the biggest and the most thrilling roller coaster ride in Legoland. My family tried the Dragon Apprentice which is the smaller version of the dragon.You can take a lot of photos at The Miniland. It has the Lego blocks built replica of cities and structures such as KLCC area, Taj Mahal, China, Vietnam, KLIA and Singapore . You can take a mini train ride along the Mini City. We also went for a ride at the Observation Tower.We managed to watch the Lego 4D movie. Initially, the staff said that the Lego Studios is under maintenance around 1230pm. When we came back after lunch, it was open. We watched the Clutch Power movie.If you want to get wet, just be prepared with a change of clothes. There is a wet ride at Dino Land at the Land of Adventure section. There are also body dryers along this ride to dry yourself after that. You can also go to the Pharaoh Revenge here to shoot laser for treasure. There is also the Beetle Bounce attraction here.There are several food stalls at Legoland itself such as Pizza Mania, Market Restaurant and Knight's Feast. Otherwise, you can head out with the pass and have lunch at Mall of Medina. Mall of Medina has Manhattan Fish Market, Old Town White Coffee, Tengu Teppanyaki, Absolute Thai, Chicken Rice Shop and Nando's among others.Legoland Hotel will be ready by the end of the year. Legoland Water Theme Park will be completed by 2014. There is also Lego Big Shop where you can buy Lego blocks and souvenirs. it is quite expensive. Lego Blocks are good for children learning though.Overall, it is a very enjoyable day for me at Legoland. You can visit Legoland's website, http://www.legoland.com.my/ for more details.",5.0
4537,Once is Enough For Me,"I read many of the reviews here before I visited Legoland. I must agree that it is very hot. I undestand that Malaysia is a tropical country, but there was not much respite except in the Market restaurant and the Build and Test area, where my four-year-old had a blast building his own vehicle and testing it though they limit the number of sets of wheels you can borrow and you need identification to take out a loan. I'll just be straight to the point:Negatives:Entry is expensive if you're a Malaysian even though you get a RM20 discount and a RM10 food voucher.Food is expensive - for Fish and Chips I'd might as well be paying in Australian Dollars.Very little respite from the heat - they should install fans to keep you cool while you're waiting in line (Sunway Lagoon have them I believe). We walked through Miniland briskly as we couldn't stand the heat.I went during the local school holidays and there was a 15 to 20 minute wait for rides (except the roller coaster - I wonder why)Positives: A lot of playgrounds for young onesThe Build and Test area was air-conditioned and perfect for kids who love building their own creations out of LegoDuplo Playland - big playground, shaded but hotTip: Go during non-school holidays if you can. Be sun smart - hat, lots of water (we brought 5 litres for each person and finished all), umbrellas, so on",3.0
4538,Hot,"Its very hot. Malaysia still need to compete with Singaporean for their professionalism and friendliness (USS). Standby with very light clothes, portable fan, sun tan lotion, sunnies, raincoat for the children shall it rains.  in case it rains, the outdoor rides will be stopped- hence its good for you to make a trip early in the morning.  as soon as you enter the park, try the ride on your left hand side first- this is more fun :)",3.0
4539,Killer Heat!,"This place is absurdly hot and poorly designed. There are hardly any respite from the heat, no sheltered walkways or shady trees at all. Queue areas for rides are stuffy and poorly ventilated. Even the sheltered playground for kids feel super stuffy. Most rides are really short and unexciting, even for the kids.My 2 young very active kids hardly enjoy the place at all due to the heat. They were slumped on the rented stroller most of the time and had to be pushed around.  The only air-conditioned play room in the park where we had hope for some respite was closed for a 'Teacher's Retreat' on the day we visited, wonderful. We scurried out of the place in just 2 hours.Avoid this place, unless you fancy paying good money to get a heat stroke.",2.0
4540,Good for kids,"Variety of rides mainly for kids, especially below 13/14 of age as most of the rides are not too extreme but interesting enough for these kids to enjoy for the day. May be boring after a while for elder ones or adults but if main purpose is for younger ones to have fun then should be worth a visit.",4.0

4542,Legoland with my 8 years old girl,It was a school holiday so everything need to Q. The place isHot as not much shade is provided.  Snacks and drinks in the mobile carts are OK but hope there could be more variety. The ride's Q time sign is not accurate so I use my own discretion. Usually we choose the less popular first then the more popular one. I found the less popular ones are still enjoyable for my girl.Restaurant inside legoland is too crowded so we chose the open air restaurant. Food is so so only. As I dont like deep fried stuff. But my girl enjoyed it.Because of my shoes got spoilt and I cant get any suitable replacement so I have no choice but leave earlier. I  have spent about 5 hours and there are lot more rides that my girl did not get to try. Will be back with a better pair of shoes.,3.0
4543,NOT FOR YOUNGER KIDS (toddler-preschool),"They should be more specific in their website, as in, ""Children below 120 cm need not go in"" or better yet ""Parents with children below 120 cm height need not go in"".What's the point of paying 2 tickets for adults and most if not all rides are not for young children? The only ride we can go on is the train ride, which was short.Maybe they should rethink before proudly welcoming ALL kids of ALL ages to cater to these tiny tots-a room with bigger sized blocks toys would be welcome,or an indoor play area for smaller kids who can not even go on those rides.A real let down!",2.0
4544,Blistering Hot!,"I read so many reviews on how extremely hot it is out there but it did not stop me from going. My 4-yr old son current favorite toys are Lego so my husband and I decided to take him there during the school holiday.We took a red cab from our hotel in JB to Legoland -- cost us RM30 (there's a more economical way to get there by bus but we decided to skip the hassle). First thing we noticed when we got there, the blazing sun of course! As soon as you handed in your tickets and passed the white tent above you, that's where pretty much the shelter ends.Legoland JB does have a lot of rides and attractions but it would probably be more appealing to the die-hard fans and those who are used to the heat. My husband and I could not stand the sun that was shining with no mercy, hence we were not able to experience the park to the max. Luckily, my son seemed to have a time of his life or perhaps he was just too young to care about sunburn.Will we go back? Maybe, when the trees have grown taller and the heat is more bearable ;) ",4.0
4545,Legoland was GREAT but not their recommended Bayu Marina Resort,"Great place for all, staffs are polite and helpful. it's awesome. We will be back again in July. My only question was why choose Bayu Marina Resort as your partner? Theirs rooms and service are terrible, I was told that it's only 25 mins away from Legoland and we did not received our tickets till we reach Legoland entrance, yet their driver told me that we must take our tickets upon check-in, I called the hotel, they told me that they forgot to give us the tickets.  We have to wait outside Legoland for 2 hours like stupid, waiting for the hotel staff to sent us those tickets. It was our worst moment indeed, very unprofessional hotel staff and no one admitting their mistake, Esp: Sugar ( not a problem solver but making it worst due to her talking attitude)Once again, all of us have a fun rides. Highly recommended to all our friends back home. Except the hotel",4.0
4546,Not very well planned,"Everyone says legoland is hot and it is. There is hardly any shade and hardly any fans. The fans they installed look like an after thought. Since there's hardly any shade when it rains there are hardly any indoor attractions to visit. From memory I think there are 3 in total, not counting restaurants of course. Drainage is poor when there is a tropical storm so perhaps the intent was to have the puddles double up as attractions during rainy days. It's a bit of a shame because its quite a nice park but the design isn't suitable for the Malaysian weather or there just wasn't enough thought put into visitor comfort. The big disappoint for my kids was lining for almost an hour in a hot muggy shed to get on a ride only to have the ride closed due to rain just when it was their turn. The right thing to do is to give the kids a ""rain cheque"" so that they can skip the queue if the weather improves. Also this a themepark for young children. Even if you're young at heart your above most height requirements, yup too big for most rides. The sweet irony.",3.0
4547,Entertainment for your Kids,"Liked: Friendly & helpful staffs. Discounts for tickets are available. Awesome colourful miniature land & statues built with LEGO. Easy access & route from highways. Plenty of restaurants & LEGO shops. Fun rides/roller coasters for older kids. Clean restrooms & other facilities.Disliked: Expensive foods & drinks, hot weather so should have planted with more matured trees. Some rides & games requires separate payment. Not much challenging rides for adult (at the moment). Open car park without trees/shades.     ",5.0

4549,New attraction for family outing,"I took my 2 young children during the Malaysian school holidays to Legoland. I would advice that you pre-purchase your tickets before going there since the ticketing queue is quite long. You can purchase tickets from groupon/mydeal at discount prices. Some travel agencies also offer at discounted prices as well. My kids couldn't go in most of the rides since the height did not permit. But there were still a lot of other places specifically designed for small children which they enjoyed. I personally liked the Miniland. The heat was unbearable and since the place is new, there aren't much tall trees around for shade. You should bring along sunscreen, caps and etc before going. There aren't any hotels near Legoland and the nearest hotel is about 20 - 30 minutes away. The Legoland hotel next to the park should be ready by 2014. They have also commenced work for a water park. Lockers are available inside. The prices for food and drinks are very high in the park so bring lots of water. You can go out of the park just once so probably best to go out for lunch and return again. There are lots of restaurants outside the park but I am not sure how the price is like.I would like to go again but only after 2 years time once the water park and the hotel is ready. But there are lots of rides to look out for. Avoid weekends and school holidays.",3.0

Cant imagine weekend on the Q!",4.0
4551,Fun way to spend time with your children!,"It is worth the fee paid for the entrance to this park.  However, in my opinion, the park is more suitable for children from 6 years and above because most rides require certain height for the children to participate.  Furthermore, the weather is really hot since there are no tall plants around the area.Nevertheless, the lego creations are superb especially those of the cities.  They are amazingly assembled, represents the cities and monuments well (KLCC Twin Tower, Taj Mahal, Great Wall of China etc etc).It was crowded when we were there last week because it was a public holiday (which also falls during a school holiday).  However, food at the pizza restaurant is terrible.  Even the soda tastes like plain water.  The chicken wings are uncooked but they did changed them with new ones, but also uncooked.Overall, it was a good experience and we might come back for another round.",4.0
4552,Fun for Young Kids,"This is probably not a place that your pre-teens would get too excited about but it was so much fun for my 5 and 7 year old kids. As long as your kids are above 100cm, he can go on most of the rides. Yes, it's hot so be prepared. Bring sunscreen, hats and wear light clothing.Take a day off work and go on a weekday when it's less crowded though I promise you there will definitely still be a queue for the popular rides. This place is huge so budget an entire day for your trip. My kids are still talking about the trip and that's testament of the fun they had.",5.0
4553,Just a trip to a new attraction,Initially we had some problem getting there until we found out there is a bus from JB Sentral. I have been to the one in Billund so probably have certain expectation for the Legoland in Johor but that expectation wasn't met. I guess expectation is subjective.,3.0
4554,Kids outing,Ticket sales counter are in long Q guess its because of the kids holidays and should have more covered areas along the Q from the heat(bring sun block) Place still under develop and not so much from the expected but eatery are well in placed directly across the main entrance...........would maybe visit again after 2014 hotel completion ,3.0
4555,Quite nice but hot!,"The theme park is quite fine, with an interesting spread of activities. Worth to spend a day, but the major issue is the heat and the limited amount of shadow. I felt that the park lacks a bit the 'Lego experience' but overall it is OK for all ages.",4.0
4556,Great for kids,We went on a day trip from Singapore for our sons 10th birthday he told us it was the best day of his life.It is a bit of a mission coming in and out of Singapore it took around 1 and a half hours to get there.Rides were fun  think he was at the older end of the ages I would take there Plenty of places to eat and lovely food Lego shop was excellent but the prices are the same as here.Take suncream we made the mistake of buying it there $15 later ...The lego buidings were amazing Great for all ages but with kids if there not huge lego fans 12 yr old might be the limit,4.0
4557,Huge and expending. Plan your visit well.,"It was a nice surprise - huge, clean, organize and the variety of games. Buy your tickets online - way cheaper. 2 weeks in advance get 20% off. Or else its RM120 for 12-59 years old online and RM140 at the door. YES, its pricey but once you get your tickets you can opt to just play the 'free games'. you have a choice. Everyone mentioned how humid and hot is it but we were not ready for the amount of walking one has to do. So the carry on bags was not ideal. We should have brought a wheely bag for your spare attire etc. Go as early as possible. Plan your visit like if you think your kids wants to see the mini world go there first because it open space. Then go in to the theatre to see the MAGIC SHOW or any performance to cool down. Go out to do other activities then go in to the Adventure World to be in the cool again. Do the roller coster ride then the 4D cinema . and so on. HOT is understating. So lots of water instead of sweet drinks that dehydrate your kids. The bathroom we visited is very clean. Not sure about the others. The last but not least, no taxis  haggling. They are metered and they use meter! How refreshing. Enjoy!",5.0
4558,"Legoland, awesome.","A great day trip from Singapore, well worth it!We went during the week when the park was relatively quiet. Most rides were less than 10 minutes wait and were excellent. With a 4 and 6 year old, they only missed out on one ride. All very well suited to young families. Food at the cafe was great, reasonably priced and very tasty. Lego shops were also awesome, well stocked and well staffed.Overall, a great experience. The only negative being the slow and painful immigration process between Singapore and Malaysia but this is unavoidable and not a part of Legoland. Would definitely go again.",5.0
4559,Only Good for Kids Under 12 years old,"I have been on a Sunday and surprised that it is not crowded.  the waiting time for most rides are short, less than 1hr.  Most rides are kiddy and only couple of rides taken interest by my kids who are both 10 & 12 years respectively.  You can goggle those rides shown in YouTube. It can be limited interest for those who want more excitement and thrill Super hot with very little shade, sun screen is a Must! Umbrellas and hats too.  Do bring in more water as there are no cooler available.  Therefore, you cannot refill your water but to buy one.  Food are available but pricey.  If you have time, good to walk out into the mall and take your meals there.  It is cheaper and more varieties to choose from.Overall,  a good day for a tan.",4.0
4560,Surprisingly good (for Malaysia),"We've been to a lot of places in Malaysia, so we were managing our own expectations on our visit to Legoland. But guess what, in the main, it was really good. Rides/attractions are still well maintained and mostly operated without glitches. We did have an issue on the 'Raiders' experience where the cars kept stopping inside the 'tomb' and resetting everyones scores (it's a 'shoot-em-up' sort of ride). But that aside, well done to everyone at Legoland! We just hope that it can maintain the current quality and standards. Unfortunately, Malaysia has a poor reputation for maintenance and we hope this is an exception to be continued here. One tip - there's not a huge amount of shade so take some hats or brollies to protect you, and slap on plenty of sun block, especially for the kids. If you have kids with you (many adults go also), get your map in advance and plan the route around. The food is ok but nothing special. And at peak times or for popular rides there are some long queues so anything to entertain the kids whilst queuing will also be appreciated. You can often get discount tickets on-line and via some real-world outlet promotions so keep eyes open.",4.0
4561,Fantastic Memories,"MUST BRINGS - Sunblock, Umbrellas, Hats or CapsThe miniature buildings was amazing. The rides were so so and food was readily available. The staff was super helpful and well mannered even under pressure ( visited on a school holiday weekend and its was kids bursting outta the seams ). My only criticism is, the place needs more trees for shade and shadier rest stops.  Compared to Denmark and England. Malaysia ranks up there.",4.0
4562,Fantastic Moments,"This place is great and impressive, my children enjoyed it very very much. The only thing was they should have more shade.",5.0
4563,Theme park suitable for Child under 12 years old,"I went there with my kids, age around 8 and 9 years old on December ( peak season ). I Bought the entry ticket online from the website and got 25 % discount from the normal price. There's a bus from JB sentral to legoland cost RM 4 every 30 minutes, so its pretty easy to go there. my first impression when I got there is HOTTTT ! so dont forget to bring your umbrella or hat. The popular ride is Project X so dont miss this ride since there will be long queue on this ride. The lego miniature is so COOOLLLL !!! I thought its only small miniature make from lego but its also moving, the bus can moving along the small street, there's also a small ship goes round and round the water. The food quite expensive and limited. Also watch out with the rain, they will shutdown the ride when its raining. I have to wait 2 times longer when its rain, waiting for the rain to stop then waiting for the ride. overall my kids happy and love legoland.",4.0
4564,The whole family had fun!,"The heat was as expected, after reading so much about how hot Legoland is. What's important are sunscreen, caps, hats and umbrellas. I suppose certain areas could have a little more shade. Food was so-so, but found there to be quite a number of flies in the restaurant circling the food.... Rides were good. Most staff were friendly and well trained, UNTIL we went to The Big Shop where I bought some Lego merchandise and wanted 3 more Lego bags to give them away as souvenirs. I spent over RM300 on souvenirs and the lady told me that they can only give me 2 and not 3 as they have their policies and needed to watch their costs! Found that unreasonable.We rushed to sit more rides at the end as it closes at 8pm and we had to budget 45mins to 1 hour for shopping. Would be better if the opening hours were extended to 10pm, like in USS, Singapore. Needn‚Äôt have to rush through the rides and could go for seconds (for some). Parking fee for the entire day was reasonable at RM7. Would like to revisit in the future...",4.0
4565,Great day at Legoland,"The last time I have been to a Legoland was in Denmark in 1983 :-) I was really looking forward to take my kids, 5 and 7, to this new attraction in Malaysia. It was really worth it.We were very lucky with the day we picked. We went on a Monday, no local school holidays. The park was not busy at all. That made up most of the fun, because there were no queues.Rides, activities and restaurants are well maintained, a european standard, that I sometimes miss in this country.We went with a bigger group of people and kids of different ages. I would say the park is perfect for kids ages 4 to 10. Older ones might get bored with only few fast rides.We will definitely come back, riding the dragon.",5.0
4566,A great theme park for kids,"The trip turned up to be much better than expected. Went on a Singapore and Malaysia holiday and jammed at custom for 2 hours, else the trip there is pretty short. Place is clean (may be because it is still new), parking is not as far as some stated and staff serivce reasonable. Food considered pricey for local but I find it standard for theme park. We had lunch at the Asian restaurant and found the food quite nice, especially the soup. Overall feel for the park is only suitable for kids age 7-12 and there is nothing for kids below 3 (maybe that's why kids below 3 is free!).",4.0
4567,Lots of fun for kids - big and small,"Quite a bit to see and do here. We did it in a day and a half without taking many of the rides. Queues for the rides seem ok - many are 5 minutes, the longest one for us was 15 minutes.There are rides for every age. A child of 6 would be able to go on just about all of them. There are roller coaster type rides that we didn't take. There are water rides opening in 2014 by the look of it.Several different basic playgrounds for younger children.There are a couple of areas for playing with Lego. Appealing for children of all ages by the look of it.We booked online for the discount and to avoid queuing, but needn't have bothered. There are no queues for tickets even at 10am, but there is a queue to get in until about 10:30.Food is reasonably priced, although if you wanted you could get a pass out and eat at the shopping centre nearby.We stayed in JB, but I think it would have been slightly more convenient to stay in Singapore - I'm factoring in that we had to take a bus from KL to JB, then flew out of Singapore.",4.0
4568,"Legoland, not just for little kids!","Legoland is brilliant! These models, statues and lego villages are amazing. To think of how much time and effort has been put into them. Went on a weekday and the lines for the rides were minimal.Rides for all ages and height restrictions on some. It can get very hot there so remember the sun screen and also an umbrella as it is likely to rain sometime in the afternoon(it can also be used as a sun shade). Beware of gift shops with young children, you won't come out with much money left in your wallet! Awesome day.",5.0
4569,No queuing made for a great day!,"We visited Legoland during mid January 2013. I have previously been to Legoland in California and agree that this one is very similar. Our hotel (back in SIngapore) organised a transit to and from the park to our hotel in Singapore. We had to cross the border to and from Malaysia, which after a while became tiresome. Getting on and off the bus to go through passport checks was annoying. Especially on the way back when the traffic was chaotic. Next time, I would just stay in Malaysia.First Impressions-Neat, new and colourful is the park in 3 words. Obviously other things around the park are still being built (hotel and watermark). Staff were helpful - it was very quiet during the day, so staff were happy to take photos to keep themselves busy. Quite often I found them asking me if they could take a photo for us, instead of the other way around.It was a very hot and humid day and this made wandering outside a very sweaty and cumbersome task. We sucked it up though and carried on - Venturing into the Marketplace restaurant and gift shop at the front to take a break in the air conditioning. People have previously complained about minimal shade, but as this is a new park, trees are still growing. But there is some shade - this may be more difficult to find when the park is full. We never queued for any attraction. The roller coasters, water rides and shows (most shows are aimed at young children - so we didn't find these as entertaining) were all walk on rides. Not a line in sight! This made the heat and humidity all worth it. I would probably think otherwise if the queues were hours long though. Overall it was a great day with cute photo opportunities and fun rides. You don't need young children to visit Legoland. We are all in our 20's and found the park quite entertaining.",4.0
4570,enjoyable and fun,definitely enjoy the park. went there during weekdays so easy to walk around the park. loved the miniature city. ride the coaster which is recommended for those who have kids. lots of activity can do with family or your loved one. the food quite nice. the open show need to improve otherwise it looks bored. the 4D show also nice. don't forget to buy something at lego shop as a souvenir.,4.0
4571,Great place for young children,Legoland is definitely a recommended place. Lots of activities for kids above 3 years old and have quite a number of eateries. I have some suggestion for legoland such as making park map available everywhere in the park. Not so assessible for handicap with wheelchair. Better to go on weekdays. Not weekend. It is quite hot so be sure to bring along your umbrella and caps...,4.0
4572,Amazing but the food is ordinary,"Went with a 2 year old, she loved the mini cities. There is enough to do here with a 2 year old, we visited 2 days  in a row.  I found the food was disappointing, but you can get pass outs and eat in the nearby mall. We stayed at the pulai springs resort. We will return!",5.0
4573,Just for kids,"We went there during school holiday, but was on weekday. It was still a lot of visitors and everyway was crowded. Ticket is pricy, we pay total RM240 for 2 adults, kids and another adult ticket was brought using the credit card treatpoint. RM10 food voucher is given per ticket.    Most of the games need to be line up. Weather is extremely hot during afternoon time and must bring a sunblock and the cap for children to avoid sun burn. Food taste is average, again, is costly. Remember to bring more drinking water.     Most of the games is suitable for family and young kids, eldest kids might feel boring on it. Heard their hotel will be opening soon on November, suggest to go there after the hotel start operate.",3.0
4574,Good for family with Kids ..,"It is a must to go .. but I won't return unless I have kids to bring along. I must say it is very amazing to see how can Legoland built so many things with just lego. Building, creatures, boat and etc.. ",3.0
4575,Our second time in Legoland :D,"We went there to celebrate our son's 11th birthday. We stayed at Thistle. We took the hotel package RM780/night (if I'm not mistaken) for an apartment size room, comes with 2 adults and 2 kids Legoland tickets 1 day pass and breakfast for the whole family. We stayed there for 2 nights. (find out more at Thistle Johore Bahru)Anyways, we had a great time at Legoland! It's hot but sometimes it rains so make sure you have your cap, sunblock, etc. Since we were there on a weekday, there wasn't any queue. We took almost all the rides countless times. The Legoland hotel and water theme park is still under construction. Opening next year in 2014. Restaurants in Legoland serves pretty good food.There are many variety shops and restaurants outside Legoland too (adjacent/walking distant from Legoland). It's opposite Legoland's main entrance.",5.0
4576,Mostly for kids,"Went with friends, and we're all twentysomethings. They had lockers for bags so you wouldn't have to carry them around as you enjoy the rides. There is a small commercial complex just across the entrance where you can eat, so that's convenient. It was sweltering when we went, so be sure to bring sunblock and a fan as there aren't a lot of shaded places as you walk around. The cafe was an air-conditioned retreat that served pretty good food. The Lego structures up front were amazing.Most of the rides were really for kids. There were only a few that big kids (or adults) will enjoy. The 4D theater experience was a treat, especially since it was cold in there. It only lasted for 20 minutes, though. Buy Legos in the souvenir shops near the entrance before you go. Best to go there with kids, and worth a visit if you love Legos. Still fun, and a half-day trip would be enough.",3.0
4577,Senior but still a good time!,"We were 2 senior couple visiting for the first time. We joined several rides and enjoyed it tremendously. Understand more thrill rides and hotel room are in the pipeline. Place are well planned out with refreshment stops and shelter from the blistering sun! Come with hats, sunglass,sun lotion, umbrella, extra t-shirts. To be thrill spend 5-7hrs!",4.0
4578,super hot but super awesome,"i went to legoland with my friends on 9th May.. we are all adult and we are so much enjoying LEGOLAND! however we can't denied the hot weather which make me tanned after all hahaa. the attraction is also enjoyable to ride by adult, esp. PROJECT X.. is super fun, i played 4 times.. in the mid day, waiting for the sun goes down, we went to the Malls, get some pancake.. fyi, we can go outside and go back to legoland, you will get a transparent stamp in your hand.. you can also go to the build and test room for chiilin and do some creativity with the lego.. there are super cuties lego sculpture around the legoland.. i really recommended to take your kids to the legoland first then you can take your kids to USS.. because its more educational :) but dont forget to bring sun block, hat or umbrella.. because the weather is extremely hot!",4.0
4579,a great day out,Visited there with my two kids. Had a fabulous day out. So much to do. All very tired. Would definitely recommend this attraction,4.0
4580,A hot though fun day,"My son is a huge Lego fan so this is our third legoland visit. One in California then Orlando then this. So we knew what to expect in terms of the rides, shops and activities but we didn't expect the heat. We're from Manila so we are used to the heat but the day we went it was like we were being baked ! If only they could put a canopy ( like the one in universal studios Singapore ) even just over the minivans it will be a great help. For now my tip is put on non sticky sunscreen, bring your shades, bring umbrellas, misting spray, fans and lots of shirts for your kids so they can change. Oh before that let me mention that if youre coming from singapore it would be good to book your bus tickets and park tickets online . We went to the WTS tour service at the Singapore flyer area at 7 am as we were advised by friends but the only available bus ride was at 1030 am so tip is book online so you get the earlier bus . We were lucky though slots opened at 9 am. Don't forget your passports as well and get arrival cards from the WTS office . The travel time from Singapore is 1.5 hours only because you have to go through Singapore and Malaysia immigration. The lines could be long depending on the time of day. At legoland, the rides are all ok depending on your child's age. There's something for each age group. The shops are well stocked . My husband said though that they don't have the latest Lego . The restaurants are ok. Food is not so expensive . Average cost is 10 RM roughly 3 USD per meal. If you have kids above 7 they will surely enjoy the activities at the Lego Mindstorms Academy . Book  this as soon as you get to the park as the slots are limited. Basically robot programming activities which my 9 year old enjoyed immensely. It's aircon too so it was a good rest from the heat as well. The restaurants are cold and cold drinks and fruits available in most areas . It would be good to bring your water bottles that can keep cold water. Scout the restaurants as they serve different kinds of food . ( the map indicates this ) my son also enjoyed the driving academy . He even got a license after :) . Legoland Malaysia is similar to the others we've been to if only they can find a way to make it more comfortable , cooler that is. One day is enough to enjoy the attractions. Oh and they have a legoland hotel coming in 2014.",4.0
4581,This Attraction Is Sooo Hot!,"And I mean that in the most literal sense of the word! Prepare to sweat it out or get drenched supposing a rain shower comes and believe me they do. We lived in Malaysia for a time and there are really two distinct weather patterns, hot and rainy. The park sprawls through a huge area and there aren't any trees or covered walkways to give shade or shelter. They should really consider this as a priority item to correct. As it stands, people have to go to either the air-conditioned food outlets, shops or the few attractions that are indoors, to get away from the stifling heat and humidity.My family and I went last Sunday, May 12th and from previous reviews apparently we got lucky and missed the power outage on May 10th and the crowds on the 11th. The crowds were manageable on the day we went and we rarely had to queue longer than 5 minutes, if at all, for any of the attractions. I must say though that generally the park is more appropriate for kids 10 years old and below. Older kids would have very little to keep them interested.The food, drinks and souvenir items are all quite expensive. I would say Western level pricing rather than South East Asian. A combo meal at the Market Restaurant for an adult costs 25 or so ringgit for soup, pasta or pizza and a cold drink. The quality certainly does not justify the price. I would say this type of pricing is quite common in such theme parks but somehow given the location, I would have thought they would temper the prices a little bit since operating costs I would expect would be lower. I was wrong so just be aware.We went to Legoland via Singapore and took the WTS bus from the Singapore Flyer mainly for convenience. The return fare was pricey at 25 SGD each, compared to 20 SGD as mentioned in the Legoland website, which I was told was the price for off peak (i.e. weekdays) days. Compared to the alternative however of going to Jurong East or Boon Lay to catch public transport using the Causeway Link buses, we still felt much more at ease to pay the higher price. We departed Singapore on the 9 AM departure and arrived at Legoland around 10:30 AM. We thought we would stay all the way until the park closed at 8 PM but by 6 PM we were all hot and tired and there wasn't much we had not covered. We thought we would take the chance to ride on the  6:15 PM bus back to Singapore but though we caught the bus in time and there was still space, somehow we weren't let on and had to wait another hour for the next bus. I suppose better transport options is another key item to address.I don't think we'll be back to Legoland Malaysia anytime soon. My kids are already above the age level the park caters to and to be honest even if they were still within that 10 year and younger age group, I still would not come back given all the hassles mentioned above.",2.0
4582,very fun,"so much fun i enjoy exploring legoland malaysia specially my family,we play and enjoy all the rides,1 day is not enough,but we will come back there again...we enjoy our holiday....",4.0
4583,Legoland - A Work In Progress,"Yes Legoland is a worldwide brand name but in Malaysia it is still a work in progress. After a recent visit it seemed pretty obvious that it was opened with a planned expansion in mind & this is evident with lots of building works ongoing around its periphery.However this is not to degenerate what is already open because some of it is pretty awesome, especially Miniland which I really appreciated.As has been said numerous times in previous reviews here there is a distinct lack of shaded areas & I cannot make my mind up whether this is an oversight or it was neglected to expediate opening to satisfy investors/banks seeking a return on their investment.There are so many opinions mentioning the lack of shaded areas that I find it inconceivable that Legoland management will not address this at some time in the future.Ok, as theme parks go Legoland is not a world beater yet, but it does have a large expansion space to utilise & it will be how Legoland uses this space that will eventually define Legoland's status as a fantastic leisure experience or another also ran theme park. Using my first visit as a basis I enjoyed many of the rides including the project X roller coaster & I would recommend Legoland as a good family day out, not brilliant yet but it could be.I also found this interesting about legolandhttp://www.spy.my/johor/legoland-malaysia.html",3.0
4584,Queue,"Basically the attractions were great except for 2 things:1. the queue took almost 10 times longer than the actual play time (you have to wait for 60 mins to enjoy a 6 mins ride)2. the very annoying thing is when it's your turn on the queue and the operator told you that you have to wait for another 30 mins due to technical issue with the ride (which happened to us).  I think some kind of compensation should be given, considering most visitors are travelling with little children.We also saw how some of the staffs working outdoors were overloaded and losing their service attitude.With the hot weather one day and heavy rainfall in the other day, I think Legoland should provide more trees for shading, more roofed path to connect one place to another, and more place for visitors to take shelter.  ",4.0
4585,Legoland one of the best theme park but at wrong location,"i being to most of theme park in malaysia , legoland was one of the best with offer for children + clean environment. those playground was really design for children + safety awareness too. 1 thumb up.Only weakness was - since it locate at flat area with open air... it can become very hot for children for 4 hour completed all games.DO bring alot of water , juice and change cloth for children to changes. Food inside although double the price but average taste..better then nothing.I affair those toy will not last long in malaysia weather , recommend to go now if haven't being there.I saw there was new hotel build beside the theme park , then it will be a good choice as children + family can go for a rest after 2 hour break.",5.0
4586,Wrong country for Legoland!,"DISLIKE!!Super hot sauna!What's wrong with the planner of this place? Can't you provide more shade to the visitors. Don't you realise how hot this region is? You should look at other similar attractions like Universal Studio in Singapore & Sunway Lagoon in KL. Otherwise you should move to a temperate country.Your shops are wasting electricity, air cond and air curtains at full blast but your door is wide open with no shade outside!LIKE !Honestly the various rides and attractions are good. Management really need to look into the building more shady walkways and planting more trees, otherwise this place would be a dessert very soon.",3.0
4587,No Electricity. Not worth the time and effort of travelling for hours!!!,"We were there on May 10. I travelled with my husband, sister and two kids (five and two years old). We travelled all the way from the Philippines to Singapore (a 3.5 hour trip) just to visit Legoland. We did not opt for Universal studios because the kids would enjoy Legoland more since the theme park would be more apt for their age group. Upon arriving in Legoland Malaysia, everyone was excited. It was a really hot sunny day. The theme park was somewhat so quiet. I didn't feel the festive mood (compared with the experience in HK Disneyland). Anyway, it wouldn't matter as long as the kids enjoyed. But it was a BIG disappointment for the kids. At 11 am, electricity went down! My son just had the Nissan Driving School at that time! So we went straight to eat while waiting for the electricity to be put back. We waited until 230 pm and endured the hot sunny day without anything to do but sit and talk with each other. No rides are operating except for the train ride. At around 230, the staff asked us to go back at the entrance and file a complaint since they are not able to fix the problem. A lot of people were lining up and all that we got is a bottle of water and an issuance of a new ticket through email which is valid for 1 year!!! They offered us to exchange the ticket with a Hello Kitty ticket valid on that day, but my sons travelled to Malaysia for Legoland and not Hello Kitty!!! The offer of a new Legoland ticket valid for a year is good, but the cost of travelling from the Philippines to Singapore or Malaysia and the hotel and bus and taxi rides costs too much for us to come back again!!!It was a really big disappointment for our sons since they had been preparing for this trip for two months.I just wish Legoland will contact us to handle a portion of our hotel and airfare for us to go back and see what Legoland experience really is.",1.0
4588,power outage..world-class indeed,"We spent much of the time at Legoland Malaysia trying to exit, given that there was a power outage from 11am to park closing. Truly stunning to see no customer service or support for such a catastrophic risk (which should be mitigated given the global brand.. i recall this happened in the UK as well).Most of the postings/reviews here are spot-on: intense heat and humidity, very little shaded areas, unexciting rides and uninteresting Lego displays. We figured we could suffer through these weaknesses for our kids, but the power outage was extremely disappointing -- more so since our families travelled from different countries to visit the Park. Ah well, Caveat Emptor!.. and still no refund... very sad.",1.0
4589,Needs time,"Very close to Singapore and easy to get to by bus. The rides and attractions are perfect for children under 10. Other age groups may feel bored. Prices of food and drinks are very high. However there is a small mall opposite the park. You can find food outlets there. Legoland has not long opened. So give it time and I am sure it will improve. A hotel is being built soon which would be nice for those wanting a weekend away. However, most rides and attractions can be done in a day. ",4.0
4590,Suitable for kids...,"It way too hot and i'm all sweat, the attraction is suitable for kids and lack of public transportation, i waited almost one and half hour for bus to take me to JB Sentral.

4591,Legoland,"If possible go on normal day instead of public and school holiday so u can enjoy the ride without long queue. It feel like miniature of universal studio Singapore, the area divided into few main themes with different rides in them. Love the Legos shop, u can find your favourite exclusive and latest sets. The lego theme hotel is currently under construction, surely will come again after completion. Nice place to spend time with family but expect to pay extra price on the food.",5.0
4592,"International theme park worth visiting, but nothing so special...","Me, spouse and our little boy (4) visited this park on weekend. We travelled by air to JB and from Senai airport (8.15AM), took its shuttle bus to Larkin and then a Causeway link bus to Legoland. Reached the park entrance about 9.30AM, half an hour before opening time.Overall, this park is a great place for family and younglings, but not for adventure seekers. Just a number of rides available, but plenty other activities for kids to try and learn something new. One disadvantage is the little known Lego characters make the park less happening, unlike those that we can find at Disneyland or Universal Studios theme parks. Nevertheless, the Lego miniland is something unique that you can't find elsewhere. The area is clean and facilities well maintained, and staff able to communicate in english, polite and friendly, seems adequately trained, contrary to some other local branded Malaysian theme parks I've been. Worth the expensive admission tickets (almost RM400 for the three of us, we were there from 10am to 7pm) but it's not a place that I will long to visit again.Getting there from airport was quite easy by bus, but when we got out at 7PM there's no more bus available and we end up taking an expensive taxi to our hotel (Tune Danga Bay).Pictures of our Legoland trip is available in my travel journal:http://www.typentravel.com/search/label/Legoland%20Malaysiacheers!",3.0
4593,still no luck.. still not impressed,"it was my second time and still encountered the same problem when i was in here last December and much more..we arrived May 10 after 4hours of travel from KL and upon arriving in Legoland boom! no electricity in the theme park so no ride/attraction is working. i have an annual pass so i can go in but my partner has none. so we decided that we will not go in and just take picture outside and wait until 230pm. if by 230pm the electricity comes back then we'll purchase ticket but if not then we'll just go home. unfortunately, the electricity didnt come back. i felt sorry for the kids that are there and some people who took package tours for legoland. but its out of legoland's admin, so we understand that they cant do nothing about it.our bad luck doesnt end there. we optedto take the bus instead of taxi going back to .larkin terminal since its much cheaper. taxi asks for 40rm from legoland to larkin which is so pricey since it costs more an the bus fare from larkin going bsck to kl (its only 35rm). so we waited for the bus.. and just like the first time i was here, we waited sooooo loooonggg. more than an hour of waiting for the bus.. they should address this especially if they want more people to go to this theme park.. there are people (tourists) who dont have car and cant afford to take a cab, so they should have more buses going to and from legoland every 30mins throughout the day since this is a theme park and it also has a shopping mall beside the theme park.. i've been to many theme parks and this one has the worst transpo system ever..

4594,Something for all age groups,"We visited Legoland on a Monday - a working day, so it was very quiet and absolutely no lines at any of the rides. 3 kids - ages 6 to 8. Drove from Singapore via the Tuas second link and took an hour end-to-end. Parked at the (free) parking of the shopping mall, rather than in the Legoland parking (no difference in the distance you need to walk to the entrance). 30% discuount for those who have a ToysRUS membership card, so make sure to print the voucher from the TRU website and take your card before you go. We all liked it very much since there were rides suited for all age groups - all the way from toddlers up, and the place is peppered with small play grounds as well. Good signage, clean toilets, helpful staff. Food choice at the food court is average, and prices similar to what you would find at any theme park. Took us about 5 hours with no lines to cover ~ 80% of the park (we skipped the 4D shows). Overall, a great day out with the kids. Will go back once the water theme park and the hotel are up (still under construction next door)",5.0
4595,electricity failure and no worthy compensation!!!!,"My husband, my 9-year-old, and I went to Legoland Malaysia today and we were really disappointed. After only 3 rides, there was an electricity failure, making the whole theme park come to a complete halt. Some rides stopped midway, including the jet coaster, Project X, leaving 2 riders stuck high up on the track. My son was a lot luckier because he got stuck in AQUAZONE Wave Racers - at least it was on ground level. (The crew could pull the ""boats"" into position and forced open the doors.) The cafes could not operate properly (one cafe turned us down for they couldn't prepare the chicken and curry listed on the menu and the big cafe was ""limping"" because the registers didn't function); the shops couldn't function properly either because credit card payments couldn't be accepted; lockers where we kept our stuff could only be opened with the help of the crew. The worst part was that Legoland could not give a refund. Instead, tickets were extended, open, for up to a year.Well, we could only comply because there was no other alternative. So, we have to plan another trip to Malaysia (from Indonesia) to get our money worth. Not very convenient, indeed, as we don't plan on going to Malaysia in this one-year period.",1.0
4596,Hot and lacking of trees for shading,Fun for the kids but sorely lacking things for adults to really enjoy. food options is still minimal and the tres are still short and  spares so it can be unbearably hot!,3.0
4597,Very fun for kids,"Our son enjoyed our visit to Legoland and insists that we go back next year. We loved the place, and the trip was fun, but since we were there in April, it was very hot. There are a few air conditioned areas to recuperate though. Bring water, sunscreen, umbrella, etc. If you forget to bring these, you can also buy them there.There are several refreshment stands and restaurants in the park. You can rent strollers too. If it rains, they have plastic ponchos for sale. We didn't try the wet ride because people going out of it are soaking wet -- and we didn't want to soak our shoes and jeans.It is a few minutes ride from JB Sentral. Board the LG1 bus going to Legoland. You won't miss it, and the staff at JB Sentral will help you out if you can't figure out where to find the bus. In going back to JB Sentral, try to leave early because the interval between buses are longer as it gets late. We flew to JB from KL, but I think it's better to tie the trip to Legoland with a Singapore trip.",4.0
4598,fun for all ages,"was super impressed with how much has been achieved in such a short time, considering it only opened in Sept 12. We trekked across from Singapore via, cab & bus all up took about 1 1/2 hours but well worth it. Heaps to do for kids of all ages and the Lego stores are fantastic with heaps to buy that is not available in our stores here in Australia. Prices were great considering the cost of Lego anyway. Great variety and the ability to buy separate blocks by weight is great. We spent way too much money on Lego but both my sons aged 14 & 12 assured me that it was unavailable back home. There is enough to do to occupy you and your family for the whole day so be prepared. Food & drinks readily available. The only negative is that it is literally in the middle of nowhere so it is very very hot. I think the day that we visited the temp was about 35 and the humidity sitting around the 85% so be prepared as at this stage there is not that much available shade however there is enough buildings to quickly duck under for some shade. I would suggest loads of sunscreen, water and $$ to ensure that you have a great day. There is heaps of Lego structures to see and the mini Lego structures of the Petronas, Clarke Quay, Taj Mahal are so well constructed that it is a true testament as to how much fun Lego really is. There is also a hotel being built on the grounds as well as other rides so give it another 6 months and there will be some major changes. We had a great time and highly recommend visiting Legoland.",5.0
4599,Probably Fun for Kids Between the Ages of About 5 - 13,"Overall it was pretty average. Not much to complain about, but neither did it ""wow"" us too much.Perhaps it was because we did not bring any kids along, and about 60% of the attractions/activities in the park are more suitable for kids than for adults. However, for the young at heart, it should still be a rather enjoyable day out. For families with kids about the ages of 5 - 13, I believe it should be a very nice outing.I thought the sculptures were rather impressive though. There was a great degree of detail and accuracy to the sculptures of some of the famous buildings in the region, and we spent a good amount of time admiring the sculptures and taking pictures. Some of the efforts to ""animate"" these exhibits, like moving people and vehicles, and sounds etc, made them even more entertaining.One complaint, though, was that this place is very pricey, especially by Malaysian standards. F&B is expensive, and we would recommend that visitors exit the park to go to the nearby mall for meals before returning to the park again. As for the souvenirs, we thought some of the prices were bordering on being ridiculous, and we did not make a single purchase.If possible, we would also recommend visiting the park during the off-peak periods, which would probably be the months of May and October, when the school kids are having exams. We have heard horror stories about the massive queues at the attractions/rides during the school vacation periods.",3.0
4600,Great for Lego fans but very hot,"My 6 yr old lived it. Most rides, attractions and lego models are in the open without shade and it us very hot. Rides are fun as are the 4d movies. Will be better with the water park as you really need somewhere to cool off. Being a big hat, lots of sunscreen and a lot of water. Probably too hot for kids in prams if you're there for more than a couple of hours.",4.0
4601,Legoland,"This is a fun filled family theme park for kids under 12 mostly and the young at heart. Remember to wear suitable attire according to the weather. Bring essential items like ponchos, umbrellas, bottled water and slab some sunblock on hot days. Queues are long on popular rides. A ride called Land of Adventure is a wet one so bring a change of clothes and zip lock bags for cameras and hand phones. Have fun!",4.0
4602,fun place for kids,its a really nice park to bring kids to especially if they love legos. most of the rides are aimed for the kiddie crowd. No major thrill rides here except for a roller coaster and a water ride. the lego replicas of various asian countries were amazing.. the park can be too hot though at midday so bring your sunblock. Food options are meagre too. Staff are nice but needs better training in terms of english. sometimes the PA announcement is hard to decipher. ,4.0
4603,Legoland (Excellent),"Went to Legoland yesterday and quite enjoyed it. I know others have complained about lack of shade I did not find it a problem Obviously recommend a hat and sunscreen. Food it alright, I would not say its expensive, as I'm from Australia I would say its cheaper that Australia's theme parks and Singapore's Sentosa and Hong Kong's Ocean Park and Disneyland. There is a Burger King, KFC and other cheaper food outlets if you want to save money. Be sure if you've coming from another country to exchange money beforehand as there are no money changers there.The rides were good, mainly aimed at kids. There's are a couple of roller coasters but don't expect them to be long or intense as other places. I was quite impressed with the lego models of all the Asian's countries. A lot of picture taking there.If you're a lego fan you will appreciate it. From the time of this review a lego water theme park is being built and a hotel in 2014 which should be good.",5.0
4604,Legoland Malaysia is just as good as Florida,"We visited Legoland Florida 2 years ago not knowing it was opening in 2012 in Malaysia. Since our 3 kids are ages 6-10, they still wanted to visit Legoland this year and we were not disappointed. Be sure to sign-up early for the Mindstorm classes as slots are limited. Its not a watered down or miniature U.S. version like what Disney did with Hong Kong. All the major attraction from the U.S. are there plus the Lego City was the Asian version with the Taj Mahal and Forbidden City. We opted to fly-in via Singapore because its only one hour from Changi airport. The border crossing was a breeze because it was after midnight. We stayed at Citrus Hotel and also visited Puteri harbor for Hello Kitty and Thomas the Train.",5.0
4605,Average but worth the trip if you have time to spare,"The negatives: it is much smaller than expected and at 140 Malaysian dollars, it is more expensive than the ticket to Universal Studios in Singapore‚Ä¶where is the logic in that? It is good fun for the kids and teenagers but adults will find it not so impressive. For obvious reasons, the rides and others are catered for the young‚Ä¶the rides are short (in terms of time and height), the entire Legoland is small, the staff looked like they rather be somewhere else, and the food and beverages are exorbitantly priced (and not tasty at all)! The 4 D movie was a let-down ‚Äì poor plot, excessive foam falling on the audience and non-motionThe positives: there are however more than enough good and exciting stuff for the kids. Maybe enough to keep them occupied for even 2 days. Sheltered large playground, indoor Lego academy, train rides, fun filled roller coasters, indoor shooting game whilst on a train. There a sufficient places for one to dodge in for some cool refuge if the weather gets too hot.All in, if you have time to spare, I would say it is worth a visit particularly if are visiting Singapore and are thinking of a side trip from Singapore. It is only 10 mins drive from the immigration (2nd link).",3.0
4606,20130422 Legoland Malaysia,"I went to Legoland on a sweltering hot day.  It was a Monday, when everyone else is working. Ha!  The park was largely empty.This park is pretty huge, bigger than Universal Studios Singapore and definitely bigger than Sanrio Hello Kitty Town, which is a glorified mall arcade.Unfortunately, there wasn‚Äôt many exciting rides.  There were 2 roller coasters, one water ride, as well as more kiddie rides such as the train ride, Legoland‚Äôs versions of Spinning Teacups and Bumper cars. The real star of the park is the Miniland.  Famous places and sights in Malaysia and around the region have been painstakingly recreated.  For me, this is the most amazing part of Legoland.  The detail is just amazing.  There is a one storey mall right outside Legoland,  consisting mostly of F&B outlets such as KFC, Burger King, Secret Recipe, Old Town Coffee, Manhatten Fish  Market and others.  There is also a mini-mart, which didn‚Äôt look fully stocked yet.  This is a non-airconditioned mall, but of course, the individual shops are air-conditioned.You can step out of the park and step in again.  Remember to get a wrist band from the Customer Service right beside the entry/ exit.  You MUST also keep your ticket if you wish to re-enter.  They will scan it again.

4607,Legoland is great family fun,"Booked this tour with WTS Travel, Singapore. Online booking was a breeze. You get yourself to the Flyer and catch their coach for return trip.  Take the 8-30am coach ex Singapore as the trip through traffic can take time and all the Immigration checks where you have to get off the coach and show your passport. (don't forget your disembarkation cards) We took the 6-15pm coach back from Legoland, back in our hotel by 8-30pm.  Two happy 7 year olds and two exhausted mums.  The whole place is set up for a great day for all ages.  I couldn't choose one favourite exhibition as they are all so fantastic. Yes it is hot and no there's not much shade.  The park only opened in September 2012.  So, slap on your hat and be sensible with the kids, lots of rests, lots of water and lots of laughs ! You can hire prams there.  No water play areas like on Sentosa or the Singapore Zoo.  Lockers available and the park will take Singapore dollars but give you change in Malaysian.  Buy your souvenirs at any of the shops and the parcels are delivered to the kiosk area near The Big Shop. Don't leave it to late in the day to do your shopping or pick up your photos 'cos those areas are heaving with people by closing time. Would I go again .... absolutely.   Go on a week day.   If you're still looking for more Lego fun head to the Arts Science Museum, Singapore; for an exhibition of sculpture using just Lego bricks. FANTASTIC.",5.0
4608,LEGOLAND is HOT,I was at LEGOLAND in april and it is a good place to visit with young kids. The only drawback is the extreme heat you will encounter due to lack of trees and shade. The shops sell over priced stuff. dont bother going. Keep to the rides.,4.0
4609,A Pleasant Adult Trip,"Went with four other friends in our twenties and thirties and it turned out to be a surprisingly fun excursion.  The Lego sculptures were amazing especially the Mini Land.  I could spend a long time looking at the delightful details and creativity shown.  However, I did not as a huge drawback of the area was the lack of shade in which one could comfortably enjoy their surroundings.  The park designer clearly forgot that Malaysia is a country with two types of weather; scorching hot and heavy rains.  This is one thing that should be improved on.  The rides were just so-so in the thrill factor category but the again...the decorations and Lego sculptures were great to look at.  Brought back many happy memories of fooling around with Lego pieces with my brother and cousins.I would recommend a visit to this place and if you do, I also suggest the following:- bring sufficient water for hydration (the kiosks are just over priced!), bring a hat or umbrella, sunblock is a must for those not wishing to turn 5 shades darker, go on a weekday (the queues can get daunting on a weekend), try to get discount vouchers for the entrance fee or go with someone who has an annual pass to get a discount and allow your inner 'big kid' a day out.",3.0
4610,Legoland Malaysia,I like all the machine in the park. But inside the park should have more big trees and sunshade for kids and senior people. ,4.0
4611,Day trip from Singapore,"We did a day trip from Singapore to Legoland using a private transport company as there were 6 adults and 3 kids in our group.  We were picked up from Rasa Sentosa resort on Sentosa island and arrived at Legoland one hour later.  The cost for transport was around SG$400 which is expensive but door to door service with fast and efficient border crossing. You can get much cheaper transport via day tour operators but it will take at least twice as long each way due to hassles at border.Lots of reviews have commented on the heat and a lack of shade so I thought it was going to be unpleasant.  It was hot and sunny all day but contrary to other reviews, there are numerous shade shelters as well as indoor displays with aircon.  The majority of activities and displays are outdoors, you are in a hot tropical country, go prepared with hats and sunscreen and have a great time!We visited on Monday and it was very quiet compared to attractions in Singapore.  Virtually no waiting for rides.  There are several different roller coasters of varying size, none of them are huge but our kids loved them all. The mini land displays are fantastic.  We arrived at 10:30am and left at 2:30pm which was enough time to do and see most of the park. Another two hours and we would have done just about everything.There is a large Lego store near the entrance but Lego is no cheaper than Australian pricing.Lots of food and drinks available inside, but there is a brand new mini shopping mall outside the entrance that you walk through to get to the entrance. The mall has Burgerking, KFC and more. You can get a pass out at the gate.",4.0
4612,Lego land,"We went during a weekday, so the queues were short. My children (7 and 5 years old)had a fantastic time. I enjoyed the 4D cinema, it had the best graphics I ever seen. The roller coaster rides were okay, not for thrill seekers but fine for young children.My son loved the driving school.",4.0
4613,Trip from Singapore with WTS bus,"We caught the WTS coach from their office near Singapore flyer. We had considerable problems making a booking so thought I'd share my experience with some tips.If you are making a booking online be prepared to have passport numbers ready and try booking at least 2-3 days before your planned trip as they seem to close down their automated system 36+ hours beforehand. If you try phoning their 'hotline' be prepared to make several calls before you get to speak to somebody. Perhaps their office doesn't open until 9:45am. You cannot then book over the phone, but need to go down to their singapore flyer office (or their Bukit Timah one we were told). When you get to the singapore flyer make sure you get the correct WTS office (facing the bus park). We went into the wrong office and very nearly got heavily ripped off by a linked company, telling us that we couldn't just purchase the $20 return coach fares but had to pay heavily inflated package prices. Eventually we managed to book just the coach fares in the correct office with very congenial staff, but more through luck as we saw their logo as we were leaving the area.Transport to Legoland was ok. It took us 1.5 hours to travel there and 2 hours to travel back. There was no signage on the bus and no staff providing information regarding the two stops for leaving Singapore and entering Malaysia. We are big travellers and thus used to working out what is happening but this could be distressing for some (it would be very easy to get back onto the wrong bus). Legoland itself was pleasant. We were lucky to go on an overcast weekday with free tickets for the kids (from Kellogs cereal packets if you can find them, for use before the end of May 2013). As previous people have said, I agree that there is a lot for kids in the 6-12 yr old age bracket, but it would be nice if the adults could get in there and play with them. We were not even welcome in the playgrounds.There are plenty of new rides that I haven't seen in other parks but some more indoor venues would be great to cool off. We saw their 4D Chima show - not quite Disney or Universal Studios style - prepare to get very wet! You can book older children into workshops which could be worthwhile.Make sure you take plenty of water with you if you don't want to pay to rehydrate. You can leave Legoland to buy lunch at the shopping centre next door and most of the outlets take Singapore dollars so no need to change money over, but you need to go to the guest services office to get a pass out. All up we had an enjoyable day and feel it was worth the effort to experience another Legoland. Hope these tips help you to do the same.",3.0
4614,One of our best family days ever!,"Bus transfers with WTS Travel from Singapore were fine. Went on a Friday, park was very quiet which meant basically no queuing. Kids and parents both enjoyed the rides and Lego attractions. Our children are 124cm (6 years) and 110cm (5 years). The younger one missed out on the log ride but did all other rides (incl roller coaster) and had a ball. The rides were often interactive and original. The 4D cinema provided as good a 3D imagery as we had seen, and the smoke machine / rain / snow were some extra fun. On a hot day, which our day was not particularly (mid/high 20s) could imagine needing to seek refuge in cafes and cinema regularly as not lots of shade walking around the large park.Food was reasonably priced and had some good variety. Staff were exuberant and friendly.",5.0
4615,Legoland was good - tour unsatisfactory,"We booked a tour from Singapore with WTS Travel which included our transport and entry to Legoland. Our time in Legoland was good, particularly if you have children travelling with you. However it was obvious that parts of the park were still under construction.Unfortunately the tour to and from Singapore was very poor. The bus was of average quality, one seat belt inoperative and the tour guide services were most unsatisfactory. This resulted in difficulties with customs in Malaysia and Singapore due to lack of information about processes. We would not choose to travel with this company again after this experience.We undertook tours with other companies during our time in Singapore and this was the only one which we felt was not satisfactory.",4.0
4616,Great for kids,"Legoland was quite big, good thing that even if it was a Sunday, there was not much crowd.

4618,Well worth a visit,"Fantastic.  Well done Malaysia!  We spent the day there and had a great time.  It was very hot but that's what you expect in April in JB.  Yes, lots of water and there are rides which give you the chance to get wet and plenty of activities in air conditioned areas for some respite.  Loved the body driers so you can dry off rather than feel hot and damp.  Great vaue for money.  They're currently building a hotel and watr park on site.  Will wait for them to open in 2014 and stay for 2-3 days next time.",5.0
4619,Looking forward to our next visit,"This is a delayed entry... We visited the park during end of the year school holidays Dec 2012.We were there when the gates opened but the crowd was already rather huge despite it being a rainy morning. Luckily, we have equipped ourselves with raincoats and umbrellas. The queues were looong at ALL the attractions and some of the attractions were closed due to the rain. By the time it was all sunny, it became extremely hot. Make sure the kids have their hats and sunscreen on. Us adults were mostly taking shade under our large golf umbrella. A huge chunk of our time were spent indoors at the Duplo Playtown as it is more cool and the kids need not queue for too long.  Nevertheless, they really enjoyed themselves to the max. The Miniland was wonderful but the weather was too hot for us to fully enjoy it.  To cool off, we had a splash of a time riding the Dino Island. Be prepared to get wet... But don't worry, there are several drying closets should you need one (fir a fee). The kids went on a few other rides but we had to skip the roller coasters as the queues were ridiculous. Would be a good idea to have estimated waiting time displayed at the entrances of all attractions so visitors can manage their time.  Food at Pizza Mania was worth the money. Kids finished up their lunch portions hassle-free.Had to cut short our visit and rushed back at around 3pm since there were strikes of lightning as a thunderstorm approaches.  There was nowhere safe to take shelter from. What worries me most is that the outdoor rides were all running as usual, even the really tall roller coasters!  I hope the management takes note of this lightning safety issue as this area is still barren and God-forbid, something untoward happens.A single day is not enough to cover the whole park. We will definitely be back to have a go at all the rides and attractions. Would probably wait until the Lego-themed hotel opens as it will be more convenient. By that time, the trees would have grown larger and the park more shady than it is now.  And, we will research the weather forecast thoroughly prior to planning our next trip!",4.0
4620,You better have a kid with you to enjoy,"Went to Legoland as my best friend (and her 5 year old son) was visiting me here in Singapore. Good thing my friends and I waited for them before making the trip as the theme park really caters mostly to kids. The area was sooo hot, it was a joy riding the dinoland water ride and getting wet just to cool down. The waiting time for getting into a ride was pretty long as well considering it wasn't really crowded when we went. I was excited to go there because I thought the lego collection they had was extensive, but I thought wrong. The store in Takashimaya here in Singapore had more choices than the one in the theme park!Lastly, if you can hold off going to the toilet, do so. For a brand new theme park, they really had bad maintenance for the toilets.",3.0

But most of the time we were having good time and trying all the attractions.The 4D movie also a good one.Don't forget to bring sun block; sun glass; big hat and an umbrella (in case of rain).

4628,Not worth the Trip,"LEGOLAND was not worth the trip. We came from Singapore, thru johor bahru to legoland. A Family trip with kids. It was our first time, and all were looking forward to a Theme park comparable to at least the UNIVERSAL Studios in Singapore. We were all disappointed to what the Park has to offer, which was not much compared to all the effort we exerted going through the border. One has to go down twice to pass the immigration and its always busy with people, and you have to do it again on the way back to Singapore. LEGOLAND does not have much Rides or attractions that will keep visitors from coming back or falling back in line. One will be enough just to make use of the time and cost of the Entrance fee. Place was very hot since not much covered areas and trees inside the theme park.",2.0
4629,Not very attractive and less entertainment.,"We made a last minute decision to visit Legoland. We reached about 2p.m. and the weather is extremely hot and sunny. The parking is quite far from the theme park. Suggested not to buy ticket online, can walk in as there are no long queue required due to less people visit. Open daily from 10 a.m - 8p.m. and the place is very new and less attractions yet. For malaysian, showing mycard will get a special price which is RM120 (RM110 entrance fees + RM10 meal voucher) compare to normal price which is RM140.The entrance fees not worth for the less variety entertainment provided compare to USS. The place still very new and some of the place are still under renovation.",3.0
4630,Timing your visit to Legoland is key here,"We made 2 trips there over the last few weeks. Our first trip was on a weekday during the Singapore March school holidays as Legoland was open till 8pm everyday that week. We reached there at about 5.15pm and the place was clear with very few people around. There was hardly a wait for any of the rides and the weather was great as it was windy and bright but not hot. In fact by about 6.30 lights had come on and the place looked even better and the rides were more fun at dusk. We had a splendid time and the rides were great for my 9 and 12 year olds. To take note some of the rides have height restrictions and 7 year olds and below may not be able to go on some rides. Our second visit was on a Sunday which was also the last day of the Malaysian March school holidays. We were there at about 3pm and the place was very crowded and extremely hot. By the time we walked to the first ride we started feeling the blistering heat. The wait for each ride was between 10 to 20 minutes and what made the wait so bad was the humidity and heat at the waiting line area. Worse was for those who weren't taking the rides and waiting for the rest to finish their ride. There was no sheltered waiting area at the rides for those not waiting in line. So basically you're standing right under the burning sun. There are small shaded areas here and there about 5 to 8 minutes walk from each other but the problem is that it is tiny and can sit about 6 to 10 people and has a tiny narrow roof that hardly provides sufficient shade from the sun or rain and its most definitely not comfortable sitting there and on a crowded day like the one we had there was simply no space available to take shelter under those shades. And in case you think that caps and umbrellas would help, they won't!Restaurants were packed. As the heat was unbearable we took our infant who was turning completely red to the room where kids got to play with Lego pieces. It was packed in there too and we found a spot on the floor. But when my husband was about to give our baby milk, we were told we couldn't feed the baby in there and he should go to the babycare room a distance away. When we got there he was promptly told he couldn't enter as it was for ladies only! Ridiculous! We understand the need for ladies to have privacy but surely Legoland should have thought of that by creating a bigger baby care room with a private area with rooms within for breast feeding. Not sure why they thought only ladies attend to babies and not men. Also there was no information anywhere saying that the baby care was for ladies only and  for an unsuspecting father who gets to the other end of the huge park and then to be told he has to go back and get mom...it can be frustrating.So, he went next door to feed the baby at the Pizza place and bought food although he wasn't planning to eat. The rest of us left to continue our rides and it started raining cats and dogs and that's when we realized that the shelters were even more inefficient and insufficient in heavy downpour. We came out of our rides and were faced with crowds of people gathered and waiting at the ride's exit but getting wet nonetheless with the winds blowing the rain in. I even saw staff using pieces of rag cloth to cover the computers and lowering the metal doors to the counters to keep out the rain! Very badly designed in that sense. We waited awhile and gave up and made a dash in the rain for the next nearest sheltered spot which was a shop selling Lego. We bought honchos there but later realized that the honchos were short sleeved which meant we still were pretty wet and the kids honchos were only suitable for under 8 year olds as they were short. Legoland's biggest shortfall is that it just doesn't have sheltered walkways between one attraction and another! This was a disastrous trip for us as we had to wait out the rain at the Pizza place which was packed with wet people taking shelter. For the price of the ticket it's definitely not value for money when customers' comfort and convenience has been viewed as secondary at this park. Also this park is suitable for those below 15 only with about 2 or 3 rides only that may be interesting for those who are older. So if you do want to have fun at this place it's all a matter of timing. Come when it's cool (those weekdays that they are open to 8pm) and not crowded. And buy food and drinks at the mall before the entrance, it's cheaper and you get a better variety.",3.0
4631,"New, so doesn't have much attractions yet. Hope to improve in the future.","We are living in Singapore so when compared to Universal Studios Singapore, this attraction is still lacking something in terms of attractions. But entrance fee is definitely cheaper compared to USSFoods are very cheap as we. The games are easy to play and we won a big stuffed toy for my kid. Bad thing when it rained as there are not much rides/attractions with shelter or roof. I also hope they have more choices on souvenir shop. Souvenirs are quite over priced. I also wish in the future, they can make the park more lively and happy as it lacks something on that part. ",3.0
4632,Disapointed,"i went to this park full of hope thinking ""only the best is good enough"", but i was so disappointed at the service, the staff and the gift shop.I don't really have good sense of direction. Even I had a map, I still got lost (poor signs). I asked the staff for directions and information about the park. i had the answer ""i don't know, ask someone else"" 7 times in one day visit, just because i don't speak malay?!The staffs who manage the rides are also very inefficient. One of the ride can sit up to 8 adults, however they will let 4 adults to take one ride when the waiting time was more then one hour. i don't understand why they won't let the couple behind to sit in the last two seats. in the restaurant, the staffs were very confused by the only 4 items the tourist can order, when most of the foods were pre-cooked and just lying on the bench.There was nothing you can't get from my home town toy shop in the gift shop. There is no proper signs for the tourist to queue up for paying and engraving their lego bricks. All of the tourist basically just stand around the counter and the staffs just serve whoever can elbow their way through first.Overall i was surprised by how poor the service is and how can lego headquarters will accept this kind of poor service.",1.0
4633,Legoland - Excellent trip for kids and both of us,Just returned from Legoland Malaysia and it was a memorable trip. The entry was a breeze and we went on a working day therefore there was no crowd whatsoever. The staff were friendly and the souvenir shop sells some nice things. The food is a bit expensive but we were okay with the offering. I would recommend this place for the family for a nice and fun filled visit. All the facilities are good and well maintained. The miniature is a lovely place to spend time and to see the minute details going into making a nice wonderful piece of work. We liked the Taj Mahal and also the KLIA airport model.,5.0
4634,Legoland great for kids (still new),"April 2013 - just back from Singapore and Legoland, in Malaysia.We purchased our tickets on line and save 20% - approx. $112 RM for an adult - HINT this is the the best value as at the gate it is about $140 RN for an adult.  HINT it is far cheaper than Universal Studios in SingaporeMy two boys age 11 love the place- not once did they complain about the heat! It can get hot.We caught the bus from the Sky Wheel in Singapore - left at 930am (there are earlier times), and it cost about $10RM return (we had our tickets).  Remember to take passports (and the white Singapore Immigration cards).  The trip takes about 1 hour and 30 minute - consider traffic and immigration.  You can also catch a Malaysian TAXI from Queen Street Bus Depot in Singapore (near Bugis Street) - but I have being told you will need to negotiate the fare.  Our bus left at 6.00pm .   Drops you back at Sky Wheel in Singapore - HINT  if come back at night , pre book a TAXI (on the bus) to avoid the wait at the Taxi stand.  As you will want to ge tback to the hotel in a hurry..to shower and relax after a hot dayThe place is very open so it does get hot - it also can rain - the rides stop when it rains.The rides are for small kids - only two roller coaster rides for bigger kids.   Do not compare to Universal Studio Singapore at this stage - which is suited more for the older (teenage set)But is is so much fun for the kids (and parents if you let your hair down).  Go on a week day (avoid Malaysian and Singapore school holidays) when we went on a Monday, it was not crowded and the ride lines were short.  BE aware that some Weekdays the venue is closed,Hint -  Book your kids into the Lego BUILD and TEST classes  located at the Lego Imagination area- it is air conditioned and beside fun and creative helps keep them cool (for 40 minutes).  But ensure you book into the sessions (located in  Lego Imagination Area) as they book fast,It is here the children do activities with computers and lego sets eg cars and moving pieces.We did the rides first - than spend time at Mini Land where there are massive and wonderful lego displays of famous international buildings and cities.  You can spend all day walking around these displays in awe - the KL Airport is a must see as is the Pirate display.There is still alot of development happening eg Hotel and Water Park still been built,  So the place will be even better in the next year or soThe food is ok..remember this is a amusement park so do not expect cheap hawker food- you can get Chicken and Rice!  There is a small mall outside the park - you can get a pass out with a valid entry ticket  There is a KFC and other food (Malaysian style) outlets.  Take the time to walk around.The shops etc take both Singapore and Malaysian dollars.We found the best to be the one with the best air conditioning - rest and re coup.The Shops have a lot of  lego to look at so- good luck as the kids go crazy,Its not that much cheaper than in Singapore and or Australia (here we are from).  But its fun to watch the kids go crazy - its lego.  We brought sets that were not readily available in Australia Best ride for me - as a 50 year old dad -  the Kids Power Towers - great viewsThe day went so quick .  So good luck and plan your day.There are lockers to hire and watch the weather - it can rainWell worth the trip and money.The hotel when finished will be awesome.Enjoy life with the one s you lobe",4.0
4635,legoland malaysia,"Travelled to malaysia primarily for the kids (aged 5 and 8 boys) to visit legoland. They were not disappointed! It only opened last year so is still very new. We went during a weekday so did not have to wait around at all for rides etc. My only tip would be if your kids wanted to do the robotic workshop (for kids aged 8 and up) is to book early. We didn't stumble upon this until the end of the day by which time it was all booked out. I booked the tickets online 7 days in advance so received a 10% discount. However I did notice that there were a few promotions ie.Mcdonalds had a 30% discount when buying a happy meal, Mamee noodle snacks (at the supermarket) had a discount also. So it is worth looking this up prior to buying your tickets. I found that given that there were no lines etc that we were able to cover most of the theme park in one day. I believe it opens until later on the weekends but I'm guessing it would be much busier then. Also bring lots of water as it gets extremely hot. They are in the process of building a hotel and waterpark so we would consider coming back when thats done (I think 2015?) as the actual park is not near anything.",4.0
4636,A place for young kids,"we made a trip to Legoland during the non peak season in April 2013. The park is still new and clean. The rides are very much catered for young children. Even my 6 year was bored with the roller coaster rides, so you might want to consider the suitability of this theme park for older kids.In terms of rides, we were lucky we did not come during the peak season. Some of the rides finished off so quickly and we had to queue up again for the kids to enjoy it. The place is still surrounded with very young trees which makes the it extremely hot with the Malaysian weather. The prices of food and drinks are very expensive.To make the most of your money, go during non school vacation, that way you can enjoy the rides a couple of time and not feel so stressed up.",3.0
4637,A ok place to visit if you have kids,"i brought my son and 2 of his friends and they had a blast with all the rides and were goin twice on all rides. however for the price you pay the value is really bad. tickets are priced at RM140-00 which is almost the same as tokyo disneyland tickets and universal studio tickets(which are slightly more) but there is no comparison to disneyland or universal. legoland malaysia doesnt even come close. even compared to movieworld or dreamworld , legoland malaysia is far far behind. the overall ambience wasnt there. it was more of a typical malaysian theme park. bad food, rude staff, dirty toilets.all theme parks serve expensive food and drinks and this is acceptable worldwide but the food in legoland tasted horrible.the heat is also unbearable but may get better when the trees start to grow.kids generally love theme parks and so my son had a blast but if legoland wants to stay popular for a long time, they definitely need improvement in all areas.legoland malaysia should use other theme parks around the world as a bench mark.. after all they are charging the same amount as entrance fees.",3.0
4638,A Novelty?,"Unless you are a kid, or a kid at heart, you will find that Legoland is nothing out of the ordinary and had been overly promoted and publicized. Well at least that was how I felt after spending half a day there. As far as I am concern, this attraction was built solely to rope in Singaporeans and their dollars. But for an attraction which we have not seen before, this park is certainly a novelty to many. I just wonder what will happen to it once the novelty runs out.With that said, I personally prefer the other theme parks in Malaysia, especially those with great rides and superb water attraction. The only thing I found interesting about this park was the enormous photographic opportunities.However, if you have young children, I think they will enjoy the trip here especially the various rides which I found to be quite boring as compared to some of the better rides elsewhere. I guess children will find these rides interesting as I don't think many will appreciate the magnificently built models by using Lego bricks.On that note, I would like to take my hat off to Legoland for the magnificent works put into the building of the models. Despite using Lego bricks, the models of some of the popular attractions in Malaysia and Asian countries do look superb. Every minute details were looked into, so much so these models look exactly like the real thing...only on a miniature scale. Expect to find some popular attractions in Malaysia like the KL Railway Station, KL's Masjid Jamek complete with the confluence of both rivers which gave Kuala Lumpur its name, the Putra Mosque and others. You can even find the Taj Mahal, Singapore Flyer, the Forbidden City and many more here. It could be a real treat to try to identify each and every models here.As there will be lots of walking here, do dress lightly and with comfortable shoes. Do bring alone an umbrella too as you can get caught without any shelter if it rains suddenly.Expect to wait for quite some time to take a ride on the many rides here as the place can really be crowded during holidays (take into consideration too the holiday period for Singapore). For some of the rides you even needs to wait for more than half an hour just to take a ride for a few minutes. Worth it? You decide.",4.0

4640,"Fun, fun, fun","The last time I've ever been to a theme park was some 18 years ago. My stint as an employee of a local conglomerate allowed me to fly thousands of kilometres away on a working visit and at the same time the opportunity to enjoy the rides at a team park in the US. Now, it takes only 3 hours drive for me to enjoy a brand new team park right here in Malaysia. Although partially complete, it is a world class attraction. If you don't have the heart for extreme rides, Legoland Malaysia is one place where you can consider. It is definitely suitable for families with younger children and younger teens. Try avoid going there during local school and public holidays unless if you are willing to stand in the queue for 30 - 45 minutes before getting into the park's more popular rides. There are many choices of food outlets in and around the theme park. So far, the food that we bought tasted good. Although the food price is slightly higher unlike those you can find at a typical hawker stalls or restaurants in Johor Bahru, I think the prices are generally fair. In terms of the ticket prices, these are rather expensive by the standards of Malaysia's average income earners. However, there are many on-going discount vouchers being offered where you could use to purchase the tickets at lower prices. So, be on the look-out for these vouchers. In our case, we purchased a big pack of Mamee snacks, which cost us less than MYR5 per pack, to obtain a 35 per cent discount for a ticket. In total, for a family of 5, it was a savings of more than MYR200. Overall, it was a good experience and I plan to come back when the whole resort is fully complete. There is a sign that says there is a water park in the making. We also saw a hotel under construction adjacent to the theme park.",4.0
4641,"Great place for kids, especially if they love Lego!","Our family of 5 (2 adults, 3 kids - 7, 9, 11 yrs old) plus grandma loved our trip to Legoland. I booked online with WTS travel and the bus trip from Singapore and back went smoothly (including stops at immigration and customs both ways). We caught the 9am bus from the Singapore Flyer and returned on the 4.15pm bus. Trip over was just over an hour and the trip back was about 1.5 hours due to traffic. There are other times for pickup and return but we felt we had enough time at Legoland to see all the attractions and go the rides. There were enough rides and things to do for primary school aged kids and toddlers but I can see that older kids might get a bit bored. But then again there were lots of teenagers there who seemed to enjoy their trip. My kids loved it! So did I! We chose to go on a week day to avoid the crowds. We went on a Monday and it was not crowded so there was little or no wait time for the rides. If you are going to Singapore and have young children, this is a great place to visit. I'd go with the bus tour though and book online at least a week beforehand so you get the departure and return times that you want. Take a hat and water. It was hot and humid when we went. You can use Singapore dollars as well as Malaysian Ringits inside Legoland. We bought lunch inside the park but there is a shopping centre just outside. Food and cost is what you would expect in a theme park - just OK. Oh, if you love your coffee, don't buy it here. It was pretty awful and I'm not usually that fussy. We did buy some Lego for the kids - only because we promised them. Prices are much what you would get back home (Australia for us) but there were a few things the kids said they hadn't seen before. Anyway you can buy a nice souvenir or two from the big shop at the entrance. I think it's even called The BIG Shop! If you happen to go on a busy day, plan your rides. If you go on or near opening time (10am) head for the rides at the back of the park first. People head straight for the ones near the entrance first. The park is nicely set up and there are shady areas where you can rest if you get too hot. Overall, we had a great time. Kids loved it, which was the most important part.",5.0
4642,not a well built park but acceptable.,"I went to Legoland Malaysia last year and it was not a well built park. There weren't many visitors and there was only a few fun rides. If you are looking for extreme rides, it will not be a place that you will like because most of the rides are really flat. On the other hand, if you are bringing children along, it will be another story. There is this lego horse ride, it is basically a lego horse that rocks and carries you on a track for about 3 minutes. If you are bringing your children, it will be extremely fun for them. When i visited legoland Malaysia, it was quite empty but i am not so sure about it now,probably they had inserted more rides. One of my favorite is the tower thingy, you have to use your bare hands to pull the rope and at the same time, you are pulling yourself upwards. If you are a food lover, the food over there isn't as good (my opinion). They serve Pizza, Pasta and others. If you are planning to visit this park, bring water along because Malaysia is extremely hot. If you have easily burn skin, bring sunscreen along.",3.0
4643,A fun theme park especially for younger kids,"This was our first (and second) visit, having watched it being built. We visited during the week outside the main holiday times and found it very quiet. There were no queues whatsoever, so the kids were able to have back to back rides on their favorite rides and went on just about everything in a 6 hour visit!  There are a variety of rides, from things suitable for very small kids (including play areas) to a couple of quite big roller coasters - in particular the dragon. The lego models of buildings form asia are amazing. There a lots of places to eat, although by malaysian standards food and drink is expensive ( but not by UK theme park standards). There are some indoor bits - the 4-D cinema, and areas where you can build models - the area for building cars to trial on a track doesnt have wheels, but you can get these from the desk in the area ( in exchange for your passport number - v malaysian!).The only down side is a relative lack of shade. We went twice in the same week - on the monday we had a great time as it was quite overcast, but on the friday it was v sunny and therefore v hot, and we left sooner. Choose your day!",4.0
4644,Not a top class amusement park but worth a visit,Firstly forget the online bookings. You might get a better deal on site. We got 40 myr off on each child and adult ticket priced at 140 and 110 respectively on buying a bottle of Coke each for 4 myr. We went on a Saturday not very crowded and finished all rides from 11 to 4.30. This place is great for small children and have 3 reasonably large roller coasters. It's attached to the medina mall that has lots of dining options. The Lego miniatures from around the world were fantastic . The Qs for the roller coasters were quite small possibly bcos people with smaller children turn up here. The lego shop was fantastic and worth a visit. The staff is great and very helpful,4.0

4648,Fun day.... with room for improvement.,"We visited Legoland in Jahor Bahru Malaysia April 4, 2013. It has been a long planned visit since it opened last year, but I wanted to wait for it to mature and run a little while before going.We stayed in Singapore, and took a day trip over. I booked a private car with a company that does  this service daily. From Singapore to Malayia, we had a Alphard, and including the driver, 8 of us headed over the border. The driver picked us up at our hotel in Singapore at 8:30am, and a weekday, it only took us 1 hour to arrive at Legoland. No lines at the border. You don't have to get out of the car at all, give the passports, and took 3 minutes to pass the border. Super easy.My friends who took the free shuttle from Singapore Flyer apparently took almost 3 hours to arrive to Legoland, so she advised me NOT to do that. Great advice.We prepurchased tickets through the car company, they have group tickets rate, so we bought discounted tickets. 4 adults and 2 children, and my 2 year old (free). It came to about close to $ 300 SGD for admission. The private car was $ 480 SGD for the 12 hours booking. The driver waits for us until we finish in J.B, and then drives us back to Singapore's hotel. Legoland was as many have already mentioned.... HOT HOT HOT !!!! No shade. I brought umbrellas. There were NO queues on the day we went. No rides had more than 2 minutes wait.The rides are cute, but mainly good for under 10 years old, or maybe under 8 years old. Driving cars were the highlight for my children. Roller coasters were ok. 4-D attraction was closed, and there was a small roller coaster also was under maintenance. Lego sculptures around the park are nice to take photos with. When we arrived, the refreshments stands aren't even opened. Just the rides were opened. Souvenir shops are opened, and with less merchandise than I expected. The merchandise at the BIG shop at the entrance is where you want to buy souvenirs. Other shops around the park.... the items were pretty much what I see in Toys R Us in HK.  Some cups and keychains for engraving were available at the water log chute ride, but that's about it.City Land- area had more interesting rides, if you are a lego fan.... then you will enjoy these areas. My kids really enjoyed the driving rides, and also enjoyed very much the indoor center where you build your own cars and race others. They have two tables with tracks and counter stop watch where you can race your cars. That was alot of fun.my kids also signed up (you have to go there early to sign up) for making your own robot move. It was hard work ... but my kids thought it was cool to use a computer to command their robot to complete some tasks.Miniature land was cute. Very hot ... only open air area.Toddlers have very little to play ... just a tent covered area with a train, and some structures to climb up and down. There is one driving attraction that my kid got into. Even though it says 3 yeas old at least, my 2.5 year old went in and had great fun driving (really driving, with no track).The rides are ok, and the park's attendants are ok.  It was so quiet that we felt none of the amusement park atmosphere. My kids LOVED the park, they thought it was really cute and fun.We didn't eat inside the park, we left at 3:30pm, finished everything in the park including shopping. Afterwards, we ate at the mall right outside the Legoland park, very limited choices, and very quiet. But we were so tired and hot, just wanted to get cold drinks. Our driver picked us up, and we headed to the Factory Outlets that was about 20 minutes away, did a little shopping, and we went back in the car at 6:15pm, headed back to Singapore. We got back to our hotel at 7:30pm.Fun day, but think with all the hotels near Legoland building, and developing the whole area, and there is a water park building scheduled to open in 2014..... I think in a couple of more years, the park and the area will be more vibrant and more fun.Nevertheless, we are glad we went, but I would NOT make a special trip just to go to Legoland and STAY overnight in the area. (Like some people suggested to me....)I think staying in Singapore was smart thing to do. One day trip was perfect.",4.0
4649,Lego go go!!!,"Our vacation was made complete by a visit to this recently opened theme park! My kids are very much into Lego, so  it was but natural for us to troop to this place. Upon arriving at the park , you could easily noticed that it is just newly opened as there are still alot of upcomiong attractions  and  a hotel being built. The trees were still small so they couldnt provide much shade from the scortching sun. The park was well laid out , the landscape is exceptional. The rides and shows are most enjoyable as it brought out the kid in me. Noticed also that in the shops, not all of the newer lego toys were available so my kids had to settle for something else which still made their day. I look forward to coming back here when it is fully developed and see what other attractions would be made available!!!",5.0

4651,Not too impressed,"My mom and I took my 2 1/2 year old son. It was extremly crowded. The lines were anywhere from 45-90 minutes. Kids do not want and cant wait that long for a ride! The longest wait we waited was for the driving school and it was 45 minute wait. There were some rides we just had to pass up because of the wait time. My little guy wanted to ride the boats but 90 mins is just too long for a little one. Some of the rides has height limits unless an adult rode too. Some of those rides my son could and did ride by hisself and not with me. One of them was a little train. He rode one like this by himself twice, once the day before at Seaworld but the was not the recommended height. If they would let kids go on some of the rides themselves instead of with an adult too the rides would not have such long wait times. The place was neat and fun but not for the cost. We stayed there 8 hours. It took my mom which had 3 people ahead of her in line for food 45 minutes. She was complaining and so was many other people about how slow the service was. That was at the chicken and burger station beside where they do the boat show. One time going was good enough for me.",3.0
4652,Legoland Malaysia,"The structures made of lego bricks were awesome. The park was not complete yet and there were a lot of attractions that were still closed. But what really made the trip uncomfortable was the heat.Since Legoland Malaysia is fairly new, the trees have not grown big yet to give shelter and ward off the heat of the sun.The rides are also fit for kids, except for the dragon ride roller coaster, but it was quick and short.For the price we paid, I think it was not worth the trip we made.",3.0
4653,Granddaughters visit,At just short of 6 years old our granddaughter had a great time. She was big enough for all the rides. Food also ok. A bit basic but cooked well and not to overpriced. Big hotel and waterpark due to open late 2013 early 2014. ,4.0

Please bring along the umbrella and raincoat if not you can buy in the legoland itself.  Just the cost a bit more expensive than outside.  There is one bus (JPO2) to legoland if you come from Malaysia custom from Tuas 2nd link (Singapore). The bus ticket is around RM$4.20 per person. If you driving, there is a very big car park lots there cost RM$7 per entry. It is a place where the kids will enjoy the most.  It have a lots of games and also have 4D cinema for the whole family.

4656,"Go on the weekdays, take the bus and cut the fuss","To sum up my experiences: 1) We went on Thursday. Very few people, indeed there's literally no queue time. We managed to ride a few rounds on the rides back-to-back.  2) We decided to take the designated Legoland bus from Larkin Bus Terminal at RM2.80/person. Wait for the bus somewhere near McDonald's. The bus is 'LG1'. It took us about 30mins to reach Legoland from Larkin, a pleasant journey. The bus is quite on time to my surprise and I'm rather impressed honestly. Note that the bus starts from JB Sentral and stops only once at Larkin. The whole journey from JB Sentral to Legoland is about 1hour. So, I personally dont really recommend driving if you are like us, i.e. not local, don't have car, dont like driving, not sure about directions. Staying in the hotels in city center is a better choice because you are nearer to JB Sentral and dont have to rely solely on the hotel shuttle.  3) The weather is hot no doubt (where else in Malaysia is not?). We managed to plan our time to avoid the mid afternoon hot sun in the fully air-conditioned and windy 4D movie theather, and souvenir shops.   4) Pre-buy your tickets. It saves us some money and I find it very comfortable to be able to go in straight away. Though the queue at the ticketing counter is not long at that time. Sadly, 1) Rather expensive water (RM2.50 per 500ml) and food. Only later that I learn that we actually can go out and re-enter once during our trip. Maybe you can go out to the mall or shops (doesnt look like a mall to me at all) straight from the entrance for more choice, eg fast food chains, icy desserts and water (RM3 per 1500ml). Just thinking. 2) Not very impressive range of souvenirs, not to mention the limited choice and not too friendly price. All the shops are selling the same thing, that's so boring and uncreative. Thus, play all the rides first and lastly shop at the Big shop, the largest souvenir shops near the entrance and also those others near the entrance. I see no point wasting your time at small shops while you can get everything they have in the Big shop.  3) Some are the rides are for kids ONLY. I have to agree on this point that the park is clearly created for family with young kids. But I don't come here for rides you see, I come mainly to see Lego creations. So, if you are expecting anything that will give you adrenaline rush, pick somewhere else.   4) The effects of the 4D movies are a little too much. I didnt enjoy being water/foam sprayed for as long as 10 seconds or more and my hair, bag, shirt are all wet. Bring a towel or like me, I wiped with my sweater. Probably I picked a too strategic place under the sprinkler, I dont know.   5) Would prefer to be able to meet more walking Legoman. Met one at the entrance, and that's all. Don't they know one of the most interesting attractions in themepark is the photo opportunity with Mickey, Minnie, Shrek etc...That's sad. My sister and I are in our 20's, grew up playing Lego, been to a couple of themeparks in South East Asia. Despite some hiccups, we had a great day. Probably will return if the Lego hotel to be completed end of 2013 is attractive enough, but after at least 5 years.",4.0

4659,Go on weekdays to avoid the long queue time,"W e visited the park on a Thursday and we pre-booked our ticket online at least 7 days before the actual visit and we have a good deal.The place is not packed on weekdays, average waiting time per rides are 5 minutes only except for the water boat driving which we did not try. I enjoyed the miniland which showcased replicas of famous tourist spots in Asia made of lego bricks. The place is definitely scorching with heat from the sun and weather. So from time to time you need to cool down to be able to enjoy the places. The whole area is not hat big and you should be able to roam everything in less than 4 hours if not only of the warm weather.I made a mistake of availing of the odyssey shuttle service from the Tune hotel going to the Legoland which is obviously not very punctual on the schedule. the driver made us wait almost one hour for our pickup going back to the hotel. i would recommend that if you can contact a taxi then it would be more convenient for you. You can actually visit the Kittyland which is just nearby the Legoland place by riding the taxi.Some rides inside the park were closed for maintenance so we did not get to try it out. The Legoland hotel is being constructed now and target to open by next year.During lunch time, you can actually go out of the park and have your lunch inside the mall which provides variety of restaurant choices. you just need to proceed to the customer service office to have your wrist-tag and stamped at upon way out. you also need to keep the copy of your ticket as they still need it when you come back.The toilets near the gate has air-conditioning which is refreshing if you are coming in from the scorching heat of the sun outside.",4.0
4660,It's a torture,"Went to legoland recently on 28 march 2013 with 2 other families by car.  We all set off from Sengkang at 0830hrs and reached there at 1000hrs.  Parked at the park's main car park, which is quite a walk away from the main entrance. we should have parked at the mall's Car park instead.No food is allowed in park, thus we had to gobble down all the food before entry.  The park is really hot as there were no grown trees or sufficient shelters.  Toilets are the heaven in the park cos its air conditioned.  We finished all our water. Each bottle of mineral water cost rm2.50, soft,drinks cost,rm5, which is quite reasonable.  A set meal cost rm25 and consist of burger, fries and a drink.It was the malaysia's school holidays and it was quite a wait for most the rides.  We finished the entire park at 1800hrs.  A good place for kids but boring for adults.  The legoland in Windsor, uk is so much nicer and cooler.  I will not return even if it's free tickets.  Universal studios singapore is so much better in case",3.0
4661,Must-go Theme Park,"I went to Singapore during Easter holiday and spent one day traveling to Malaysia with husband and a family with 5-year old kid. We found that LegoLand is a great theme park for all ages. 1)some games are especially designed for kids, and some exciting games are designed for adults. So everyone is happy there for the whole day.2) if u like taking photos, this is really a must-go place. The small world is simply fantastic! Many spots are attractive for taking photos. 3) although this is super peak Saturday, the waiting time for most games are acceptable, say 30-45 minutes. This is much better than the Universal Studio Singapore in respect of the waiting time4) the burger inside LegoLand is very hard, no matter it is beef burger or chicken burger.5) don't expect you will find everything at the several Lego shops. Also, price of Lego is a bit higher than we bought in HK.",4.0
4662,Bad Move To Go On A Weekend,"We went to Legoland 30th of March. We arrived around 11am. Parking was already a challenge as there was a long queue at the entrance. Inside the park, the waiting time for popular rides was around 30-45 mins. We were willing to queue for the kids but the ventilation was poor. As with the other reviews, the park needs to provide more shade for the patrons. It was very hot and humid. Since there were kids with us, we decided to leave after only 2 hrs. We were already getting a headache because of the weather. We were only able to take 3 rides:-( (Needless to say, we did not get our money's worth.) I don't think we'll be back anytime soon.",3.0
4663,Best for kids under 120cm,"My 5-yr old daughter loves rollercoasters and she went on all of them in LegoLand Malaysia. The queues were bearable eventhough we went on a Saturday. We bought this transportation & entrance ticket together when we booked our room for Tune Hotel, JB. ",5.0
4664,Gurls... school holiday fun,"Finally made the visit of this much anticipated attaction for kids with my girls during last school break (end of March 2013).  My 3 girls enjoyed it very much and taken most of all ride that are suitable to their age (9 - 13 YO). Their verdict - FUN! For some adult the ride may not be too challenging but it is quite enough for me...  But it is very hot.Tips: 1. Please be there early so that you don't have a long queue for each ride. We were there when the park open at 10am. Futhermore it wasn't hot yet in the morning.2. If you like that ride & would like to go for a second ride, just stay and take another ride. Don't wait to come back to take a second ride, coz by that time there may be a long queue already.3. Bring your own water because water there is quite pricy for a Malaysian, smoothies is RM10 per cup.4. It is hot there, bring sunblock & umbrella.5. Don't bring your valueble there because you may have to leave your bags on the side before taking the ride for peace of mind leaving your bags. 6. Please note down your parking lane because it is big parking space. If you come early you could park at Zone 1 & 2 near the park. Zone 3 is near the mall & slightly further compare to zone 1 & 2.",4.0

Apart from the extreme heat, our kids had a moderately good experience with the rides. Kids older than 12 would probably find the park a tad boring.",3.0

I hope u The ""LEGOLAND'"". Management  will seriously look into it when it rain thunder and lightning. There are many foreign visitors with children looking for shelter and shelter is surely not enough.-Indah(Singapore)",5.0
4671,LEt GO Land. Once is enough,"Before I came here, I think Legoland will be awesome because can you imagine buildings, statues, monuments from lego. Waw! That will be great!It's all changing when I get down from the bus and see how the sun is shining so bright and so...hot. The heat is quite killing me because not much places to hide from the heat. I got sunburn and fever cause of the heatstroke after back home:( Don't forget to bring umbrella. It can protect you from the sun and also from the rain! (It was raining when I'm almost get out from the park). I can see other visitors run try to hide from the rain and have to get stuck in the shops with many of other visitors (as I said, this place is too open. Not much place to hide from heat or rain).Start from the gate of the legoland, a lot of statues which made from lego already greet us. Interesting. They come in different size, from short until human size. And then I saw a big face of Albert Einstein that made from lego. Then we can find lego kingdom, small rides for kids, nightmarket's type of game like throwing ball into the bucket and you will get doll, lego driving schools (is gonna be very interesting for kids), and other things.For me, the most interesting part of this theme park only at the miniature cites. You can feel like a giant between many famous buildings in the world like Petronas Towers, Chinese Palace, Angkor Wat, and many more. But for you that have been seen the one in Madurodam in Netherland, this place will become not that great but still interesting to see.Let's talk about the food stalls. The food is so-so. Just standard like ice creams, hotdogs, muffins, nasi lemak, french fried, etc. But I like about the shops because they can receive other currency like singapore dollar which Sanrio Hello Kitty town can't (but they accept visa and master).  I really have to think a lot to come back to this place.",2.0
4672,very educative n fun but need more action ofvthe cast at the attractions,"Its genuine, creative, could be more fun, cant wait for the water park to open, just the heat was killing. Some of the attractions seemed deserted like the retro theatre thing, and need more actions of the cast to attract guests to try the rides, since some are quite genuine n could be fun to do in a team. However, id love to see more coming soon",4.0
4673,"Awful heat with no escape, terrible food... the list goes on.","The bus trip with WTS bus tours from Singapore was supposed to take an hour and took three.  We got there and realized that it was a heat island - all surrounding trees had all been cut down and there was nearly no escape from the heat.  My three year old could go on barely any rides and it was utterly overcrowded.  The food was horrific, the toilets absolutely vile,  and the whole place is geared towards getting every to purchase lego - which has now morphed into gender-separated pre-made kits.  Disappointing.  Would not recommend going there - perhaps it is different in other countries, but that was our experience there.  Sad.",1.0
4674,Great day out,"We and our 3 young boys loved Legoland Malaysia.  Even though it is expensive by Malaysian standards, the park has been created very well, the rides are great (the Dragon ride is much more thrilling than the Windsor one), and the food and drink is really quite reasonably priced.  We hardly queued all day, despite it being a school holiday, though this was helped by arriving early.We will definitely come back here once the hotel is finished in 2014.",5.0
4675,My 3-yr old had a lot of fun,"1st of all, I want to declare that the comments from all the other commentors about this theme park is true. Trees are too thin...you get sunburnt...you need a lot of water to keep yourself hydrated...and also...you need a poncho as it will get rainy towards the end of the day.But I am giving this park a favorable rating simply because the place is very friendly to young children. Staff are well-trained with very nice and pleasant service. There are sufficient rest areas with air-cons but the air-cons in the toilet are kinda too chilly...so mothers, please wipe your children dry from their sweat first before ushering them into the toilet.All the rides are so adorable...recommended age to visit this theme park is probably 5-15 yrs old? Older children might find this place a tad boring unless they are Lego fans.I will definitely visit here again when my daughter is older and when the hotel is ready in 2014.",5.0
4676,Legoland - First in Asia :),"So, it's the first in asia and they were newly opened in August (if i'm not mistaken). I decided to stop for a visit because I'm a fan of theme parks. Overally, i would say for malaysian standard, is pretty good. The rides are safe, cute and definitely fun for the children. I'm in my mid 20s and of course I would expect something more adrenalin pumping, but then again, this a fun park for young children and pre-teens. So I was forgiving and had an exciting time. The only downside and know they can be better is that the trees are too thin. It was so hot and bright that I got sunburned. Adding that up, the lack of water really kills. I was extremely dehydrated most of the time. And that got me wonder, what happen to the water dispenser that every theme park should have one?",3.0
4677,Hottest theme park I ever visited,"When I say the 'hottest theme park I ever visited', I literally mean HOT as in the temperature. I have been to USS Osaka and Singapore, Disneyland in Hong Kong, Disney Sea in Tokyo, but Legoland in Malaysia is super hot because of the tropical weather and also the park is seriously lack of trees and covered walk ways. So do arm yourself with big brollies, UV-blocks, sun-shades, hats and lots and lots of water!You will find the rides fun and entertaining, if you are 12 or below. My two kids (3 and 5 YO) enjoyed themselves thoroughly. My daughter couldn't stop talking about how much she loves Legoland Malaysia. There is very strict height restriction policy for most of the rides, so my 3YO who stands at a mere 95cm had only a few choices of rides opened to him. But we made the best out of the rides he could play on by letting him go for a couple more rounds when the queue was not too long. And so, he was very pleased too.If you are an adult, like myself,  I didn't feel the park caters to the thrill-seeking spirit in me. I wasn't particular interested in any of the rides, they were all too kiddish and unappealing to me.They are building the theme park hotel beside the entrance of the park. It would be interesting to see how the hotel would be like after completion. If the rates are reasonable, we might return to Legoland Malaysia and even stay a night or two at its hotel the next time. But in the meantime, they seriously need to transplant MORE big shady trees, like a lot MORE!",3.0
4678,Kids Freindly,"We have annual pass, so we have visited several times, first time when we went it was a Saturday, hardly our kids got to ride, because we had to queue everywhere.  The sun was scorching, in between there was rain, most of the rides were temporarily halted. It was a tiring experience.  Next time we visited during week day, afternoon, it was much better. We were armed with hats, rain coats, spare dresses for kids and plenty of water and rehydrating drinks to battle the sun. It wasn't crowded, so my kids who are in lower primary, had absolute fun, everywhere.  Though, my teenager liked 'project X', 'Dragon', 'wave racer' and 'Flume Ride' than the others.  My son's favourites are Project X, Dragon, Nissan Driving School and 4D shows.Getting annual pass is worth the money, because we can visit conveniently, even after 2, 3 hours of fun, you can leave.  During rain, my kids watched the 4D shows and played with Lego blocks.I could observe a pattern, like when your enter Lego land, you can see project x and wave racers, which will be crowded in the mornings, so you can straightly proceed to the interior parts and get enjoy with lesser queues, esp. Dragon and Flume ride are less crowded int he mornings.  Around lunch time you can combe back to the entrance.",4.0
4679,Exciting Fun!,"We have the annual pass and the heat did not deter us from visiting it twice in 5 months!  The experience from the first visit allowed us to plan better for the second visit.  Yes, the sun and heat can be unbearable but with enough sun protection such as hats, sun block, umbrellas and lots of drinking water made our second visit so much better and more fun.The trick is take an afternoon break when the heat is unbearable.  Have lunch in any one of the air-con restaurants in Legoland or Medini Mall which is just outside.  Alternatively, go back to your hotel to shower and rest and come back again towards the late afternoon.  There is also a very cooling baby room but its reserve for those with babies and toddlers.I find it easier to handle the sun and heat after 3 pm because it starts to gradually get cooler in the evening.  So for those who want to go in the afternoon make sure Legoland is opened till 8 pm, which is normally during school holidays in Malaysia or Singapore.Legoland is growing park with more attractions to be added which mean the price of tickets will also go up!  They charge a premium for food and drinks which is still expensive based on Singapore prices.  But for affordable meals we can always go to Medini Mall which has wide selection of food.I didn't find it to be that long while waiting for turns for rides.  However, this time they have restricted the number of wheels at the Innovation Centre they give out to kids to build cars.  This put a damper to it cos we cannot wait until someone else returns the wheels before issuing out to the next customer.Most parents spent most of their time at the Duplo playground which is a canopy covered area to block out the sun and rain.  Kids really love it here cos its a safe and comfortable environment for them to play.For those who can afford it and have the time for several visits, get the annual pass.  Its worth the money!Will definetely go again soon.  After all have the annual pass!",4.0
4680,Shades and hats are a must,"I am a big lego fan and this is the main factor for me ranking this attraction as very good. The mini-cities are a delight for any lego lover! In terms of rides, i was impressed with the independence they encourage the children to take. E.g. there are a number of rides that the children can take by themselves provided they meet with the age and height requirements. That being said, it is a park for children, not adults. If you have younger children, there are a couple of playgrounds that are great for them.As highlighted by other reviewers, the park does not have a lot of shelters so it BURNS by mid-day. Queues are long - in part as I noticed that the staff permit guests to choose if they want to share their ""space"" with others (e.g. a carriage for 4 can end up with 2 or less guests as the guests are unwilling to share).The other plus point i would give this place is their current mini-figure exchange promotion with every children meal priced @ RM$15. Nice touch. Meals are very very average only, and not too overpriced for drinks (RM$2.50 for bottled water).If you are traveling by yourself, you can book your tickets in advance for a discount. Whole day parking was RM$7 and I parked at zone 1 - about a 10-min slow walk to the park entrance.The park became really nice to enjoy after the crowds started to leave at around 5pm to closing time at 8pm.",4.0
4681,"just ok, i hope to see more coming though","it was a very creative theme park, but, under the scorching sun that often turns into sudden washing rain, it sure needs a long way to compete with the others, since they neighbors are indoors and coveniently AC-ed. but i want to see more of it in the future",3.0
4682,Family fun,"we recently took our children here aged 9,4 and 18 months. they all absolutely had a fabulous time. there was something for all ages. best fun park we have ever been to. best to leave a whole day to visit lego land as there is so much to do and also you lose time stopping at customs if coming to lego land from singapore.",5.0
4683,"Fun for kids, Singapore prices","We visited the park shortly after it had opened. It was an easy drive from Singapore and very well sign posted from the highway. We arrived early in the day and there weren't any queues to buy tickets. The price is quite high for the size and location of this park but my children enjoyed the day so I can't complain. Let me start by saying; the Lego model cities are AMAZING, they are beautifully constructed and so well laid out. You have access to view them from all angles. Unfortunately there is NO shade at all, none whatsoever, so you feel you have to rush around to avoid standing in the direct sunlight too long. It's a shame really because the exhibits really deserve to be enjoyed. We queued for all the rides between 25 - 40 mins. We actually gave up waiting for the 4D show as the queue times were too long. However, whilst waiting, the children (aged 2, 7 & 8) were able to play in a covered playground.The favourite activities were the driving school and the fire station which we saved until last and thankfully we did as there were no queues by the end of the day. The shops are really well stocked with great Lego products. There wasn't a lot for the 2 year old to do but it was ideal for the older kids. My advice is to bring umbrellas for shade, high factor sunscreen and drink plenty of water!",3.0
4684,Hot.,"The one overriding sentiment one gets from a trip to Legoland is that it was hot! The management should seriously consider installing more canopies and cooling fans to ease guest discomfort. For some rides such as the circling planes, the seats and handles were burning, and this after a stifling queue. One constantly feels dehydrated but at least there were drink stations around, although not many air conditioned.It would be hard to compel me to visit again anytime soon. Nothing particularly fun comes to mind when one is burning.",2.0
4685,Still under construction,"The park was smaller than expected, because the price was quite high.  140 Malaysian ringget for adult ticket gave me higher expectations.  There are still unbuilt sites, especially for water related play.  But for fans of Lego, it definitely hits the spot.  The sun was grueling because there are very few outdoor shaded rest areas.  Cost of food was of course very high, as expected for a theme park (example: fish & chips cost $20 Malaysian ringett).  Driving from Singapore was quite easy as many ""Legoland"" road signs are posted after highway exit.",3.0
4686,Definitely for kids,"There are not many rides, and most of them are more targeted at kids. I wouldn't recommend this for anyone above the age of 12 as it may be quite a boring place unless you have the soul of a playful child! Queues are horrible during school holiday season so make sure you plan to avoid those peak periods if you're intent on going.The souvenir shop was quite a letdown as I expected more variety. Still managed to get some good minifigure buys though!Wouldn't go again. Until maybe when I have kids.",3.0
4687,More fun for kids.,It was more fun for kids. Theme park could do with better architecture/landscaping - too little sheltered walkways and weather was very very hot. The 4D show was quite a let-down. There should be a shuttle bus service into the theme park to generate more crowd.,3.0
4688,Small but friendly,"Just came back from Legoland yesterday. The place is situated at exit 312 on the North South expressway of Malaysia and you can hardly get lost, there are plenty of signs directing the way. It's around 15 minutes driving from Singapore, Tuas checkpoint on a weekday. Before departure, be sure to book online and print tickets on your own. You will get a good discount and also avoid queues. Once arrived, you are greeted by an array of restaurants before you even enter the theme park. The best about this park is that the rides are all kids friendly. I've brought my kids to a few theme parks but they could only take one out of ten rides due to their height restriction. However not in Legoland, my 9 year old and 5 year old gets to take all the rides. Very children friendly. The biggest problem of this place is the lack of seats and shelter. I was baked under the sun for a very long time but would have been worse if it were to rain. Though there are disposable raincoats on sale, the lack of shelter means the only thing between you and the elements is that paper thin ponchos. Sunblock is not being sold in the park. Instead, they have hats and umbrellas. I finished the entire park from 1030hrs till 1300hrs as there were no crowds when I visited it on a weekday. Each queue last only 5 minutes but I've heard that queue can last up to 30min on a weekend. As such, we took all the rides twice. Food and drinks are plentiful throughout the park. Although it is a tourist attraction, food and drinks are reasonably priced. However food outlets are small and it is obvious that sitting spaces can be difficult to find if the park is at full capacity. The park could have a parade to spice things up, or more characters going around. There was only one person in a Lego suit at one of the store. Personally, I will like to see more Lego theme items around. Seats, tables, even toilet bowls perhaps.  There is a Legoland hotel slated for opening in year 2014. Till then, one will have to find other options base on their respective preferences. ",4.0
4689,A hot theme park,"Date of visit: 18 March 2013No. of pax: 2 adults and 2 kids aged 6 and 4Mean of transport: CarWe drove in via 2nd link Tuas and it is pretty accessible. A 15 minutes drive from custom will take you to Legoland. Signages along the way made it difficult for you to get lost honestly. Simply follow the road signs.Tickets are relatively expensive. MYR 140 for adults and MYR 110 for kids above 3. The staff gave out a MYR 40 discount vouchers to visitors who bought their tickets via counter. So you may get lucky to have a visitor coming up to you giving you the discount voucher cos it isn't quite likely that they will visit the place again in the near future. The validity of the voucher is short. We considered ourselves very lucky cos a Malaysian lady was distributing her vouchers and we managed to save MYR 232 on entrance fee!If you have young kids like us, you can forget about your stroller. They have a rental store where you can rent their strollers - single stroller at MYR 30 & double stroller at MYR 45 for the whole day. The kids are able to go in and out of the stroller by themselves rather than carrying them out. The rental station is situated near the entrance on your right hand side.Except for this rental of stroller service and the food, the rest of the items found in Legoland Malaysia are very pricey. To get your picture printed on the Lego tiles, you would have to paid MYR 150 for it. To print them on a small puzzle around 5R size, it costs MYR 40. Not cheap la but it's not like you go there every month (not if you are an annual pass holder), so just buy for keepsake lo.It was extremely hot on the day we visited Legoland. We had the kids wearing caps and holding umbrella at the same time. Unfortunately, we couldn't fight the heat. Please wear real light if you are thinking of visiting. Umbrella and caps are a must. Bring COLD drinks along too. You will need tons of icey water, not just plain normal temperature water wor... you really need COLD ICEY water to cool you down. If you don't want that hassle, you can purchase the bottled drink (smoothie or ice soft drink) at MYR 25. Refills are possibly at MYR 5 (for smoothie) and MYR 3 (for soft drink).For the start of the day, I would suggest you to go straight into the park. Why? Cos everyone will be crowding around the rides they first see. Like us, we turned right and saw the driving centre for kids. The first thing that came into our mind was QUEUE! We spent a good 30 mins queuing for the ride and it lasted only 3 minutes. We then went straight into the middle of the park to the 4D studio where there were lesser visitors. When there are lesser visitors, queue becomes shorter and same goes to the waiting time. Legoland is big but not as big as many describe. We actually finished touring the whole park in about 5 hours (we reached at 11am and finished touring at 4pm). Except for all the roller coster rides, I think we pretty much covered the whole park. We then headed back to the entrance to proceed with our photo purchase. When we saw that there was no queue at the kids driving centre (the one I told you just now), we brought the kids back for their second ride. This time round, they were issued a driving licence after their ride. My kids were elated.All in all, we had a fantastic day at Legoland. The staff are very helpful and friendly. I used to have bad impression on Malaysian service but now it has all changed for the better. Just a highlight for parents.For every kids meal you purchase, you will be given a voucher. You can redeem a mini lego figurine from any redemption counters you see. If you have no kids but you wish to have the mini figurine, fret not. You can purchase them at the store. 3 minis at MYR 25. The store sells loose lego tiles at 100g for MYR 35. You can do your unique name stand. They have sample for you to follow. I did mine ""TING"" with some flowers at MYR 26.60.We will be visiting the place again once the hotel is ready in 2014. :)",4.0

4691,Just Opened,"We went to Legoland towards the end of October 2012. The park just opened around a month. The designs made from Legos were simply amazing and that is the highlight of the park.Malaysia is a tropical country so hot is normal, if you come here prepared for that then you'll have an easier time. If not, you'll want to go back to your hotel. There are no water fountains for drinking here unlike the other theme parks so bring water water and water. Since it is new, trees are new also, that means small so no shade yet for you (try coming back in 2-3 years then it should be cooler.They are going to open another section sometime in the near future so dont come here yet, wait until its fully opened then I guess it would be a great experience. But for now I will go back to Universal than come back here.",3.0
4692,"Great for kids, not for seasoned theme park visitors","All the rides here are catered for young and old kids alike, so don't go in hoping for some big thrill rides, coz' even the 'scariest' roller coaster can be ridden by an 8 year old (or younger, if they meet the height limit!). It's also small compared to most theme parks I've been too worldwide. If you don't dilly dally and there aren't many people (and there were few people even though I went on a Sunday), you could finish all the rides in slightly over half a day, then spend the rest of the time making mini Lego figures, or taking photos of the mini Lego buildings which are pretty cool if you can appreciate the hard work put into making such figures. For me, best ride was the Egyption shooting/ ride, where you score points the more targets (round lights) you shoot while on the ride).",3.0

4694,Baking hot,"Legoland is highly recommended for kids 14 years old and below. But I wish that the management could help keep the heat down by installing overhead tents with big fans. Or put in misting machines like in USS Singapore.I Interesting is as interesting is but when it gets too hot for comfort , you lose your zeal to explore the place, because the heat is headache inducing inspite of wearing hat, sunglasses and chugging bottles of water, drinking fountains in every attraction would also be well appreciated by visitors. Better yet, the management find the budget to enclose at 70 % of the park in Aircon or even just like  the Medini Mall with high ceilings with big overhead fans.  Giving a comfortable experience will encourage repeat visitors because it would be an enjoyable experience, mentally, visually and Physically. when I ask my kids if they like to revisit Legoland, they said no, because it is too hot inspite of it being interesting.",4.0
4695,"For kids 5 - 11, spacious, basic technology reflecting Lego, little local food","Went on a Friday to avoid the weekends and was a good choice. Kids are 5 and 10 yrs old and can see that any ages outside these 2 may be more suited for other theme parks like getting or Disneyland or ocean park in Hong Kong. Place is spacious and no queues. Used the Dutch lady milk discount which you can still find in grocery shops, expiring end march 2013 in Singapore which gives one free kids entry for 1 paying adult.Try to go for the popular rides first, when you go into the park at 10am in the am. 10 yr old kid seemed to enjoyed 70percent of rides and 5yr old abt 50 percent. Not enough shades in the park for old folks but better hot than rainy not enough local foods as well. Price is reasonable if you are used to exorbitant prices in tourist attractions in Singapore. Eateries mostly outside the entrance of the park. The toys in the toy shop are not any cheaper than what you get in singapore and indeed, higher, given the frequent discounts in shopping centres. Overall, I give it a 3.7 for adults and a 4.3 for kids",4.0
4696,New and Hot but was Fun!,We went here from Singapore it only took an hour drive including border immigrations. It was very hot when we got there so I suggest bring caps or umbrellas since the park is new so all the trees planted would take years to mature. Everything was colorful and suited for kids and Lego fans.  There is a hotel and a water park still being constructed. The staff were friendly and courteous.  We enjoyed the rides and the 4D movie.  Food selections were good. We'll be back if everything's constructed.,3.0
4697,We will be back,"We bought our tickets online and chose to go on a non-school holiday weekday. It was a good decision as we literally had the place to ourselves, no queues for rides, 4D movies and food. Yes, the place is hot (it's Malaysia) and I don't think it will improve even when the trees are fully matured. I shudder at the thought of visiting this place during school holidays, the heat will make the 76 acre park unbearable to most, if not all.Everything looks new, bright and colourful (so it should given it's only been opened for a few months). Staff are generally polite but clueless. The hotel is under construction and a water theme park as well. We will be back when these are done.",4.0
4698,"Hotttttt, Fun and Friendly","Go there from Singapore by tour bus. 1st Impression: Hooottttttttttttttt.... Very hot. We go there on Monday, so the visitor is not much; we can play any attractions without have to queue. And the staff also a little bit flexible in applied the minimum height for some attractions, so my youngest daugher can almost play all attractions too. The highlight in my opinion will be the Dragon in Lego Kingdom Zone - it's a roller-coaster, the trek is long with many twist and up and down. The next will be the Wave Racer in Lego Technic, it's on the water so expect to get wet a little. The souvenir shop is full with Lego stuff but unfortunately it doesn't show the latest one ie Hobbit and the price is normal; i expect it should be cheaper considering it's directly coming from Lego. Overall, if you have small children under 10 years and at least 90cm height - they will enjoy this very much. But for teens, it's might be a little bit boring since there's only three attraction that require your adrenaline: Dragon, Project X and Dino Island.",4.0

4700,"Big place with little shade, rides suitable for younger kids","Quite a distance to walk from parking area to the entrance.  Parking charges are reasonable if you were to stay long there.  The place is big (in fact bigger than USS S‚Äôpore) with little shade and having only half a day to spend our time there, definitely it is impossible to cover all rides.  Many ‚Äòkiddy‚Äô rides and very suitable for younger kids (aged 3-10 years).  As for adults, there‚Äôs nothing much to do, just sightseeing and photography.  Not much choice for food and drinks inside the park, and the price is expensive, but thank god Medini Mall is just next door!  LEGO replicas of places in ASIA (mini version) are a good display and staff was friendly and helpful.",3.0
4701,Good time to spend with kids,Even on SUnday it was not too crowded. A must visit for parents with children. We really had great times there.Dislike-food too expensiveso we ate after we checkout of Legoland in the mall,5.0
4702,"Not 100% ready yet, go after 2014 should have a better experience...","Once arrived the area, you already know Legoland is not ready yet; Legoland is surrounded by many construction sites, even Legoland itself is still constructing new area (Legoland Hotel and Water Park open sometime next year).Legoland is small at these moments, similar size to Hong Kong Disneyland. Most of the park are open area, really hot day when I visited and easily dehydrated, and I personally found drink carts are not enough within the park, maybe because it is weekday, and not much people visiting (no line up at all for most of the attractions and rides). As a fans of Lego, 'Miniland' should be the most interesting area; mini-sized but detailed landmarks of Asia made with bricks, and you will be amazed by what Lego can do. For other attractions and rides, only two to three rides are for adults, and most of them are suitable for children or young teenagers. If you go as a family, this place may spend you 5 to 6 hours, but for couple like us, it only took us around 3.5 hours to finish the whole walkthrough + 6 rides + photo taking in Miniland (which already took me more than an hour).There is only big Lego Store just next to the entrance, but do not expect to get any special edition or ""really hard to get"" or ""discontinues"" products in this store, most of the Lego sell there can easily find in any places in the world at the similar or even lower price. Price for foods and drinks are a little high, but there is a tiny shopping mall with numbers of restaurants just opposite of Legoland's entrance (2 to 3 minutes walk), where you can get more choices of foods and drinks (and you can re-entrance again Legoland again in the same day).It is worth to go as a family, but I really suggest that do not go now; I think we can get a better experience at Legoland in 2014.",3.0
4703,Blazing Hot but Fun for Kids,"Finally visited the ever popular Legoland Malaysia last Saturday. Surprisingly the crowd was less than we'd imagine and hence we could take our 3yr old daughter to enjoy most of the rides permitted to her age and height. I would say the perfect age to go would be 5 or 6 yrs old in order to fully enjoy all the activities.The Miniland is a must visit so if you see the skies getting dark with a chance of rain which happened to us, I'd suggest heading over to Miniland first before it pours.Food wise, it's pretty basic and to be honest incomparable to Universal Studios but being able to play an abundance of lego bricks with your child is an unforgettable joy indeed.An important tip is to bring along hats or umbrellas as there are very few shades within Legoland especially with the young trees surrounding the area. The scorching sun can really dampen even the brightest of spirit especially when lining up for a popular outdoor ride.",4.0

I don;t think it would have been much fun if you had long waits in the sun. It was a really hot day but the many restaurants with good aircon and reasonably priced food helped to break up the day. Getting a taxi there was easy and a red cab cost RM25 to get there. On the return trip a blue taxi was RM45 which was still very reasonable and they were waiting at the taxi stand ready to go without us having to call one.This year they will open a water park and resort on site, if you can wait until then it will be even more fun.",5.0

As with most theme parks, the queue can be long for some rides.  With the tropical climate, high temperature and humidity it can take it's toll on guests. I hope they are able to maintain the level of service and standards and better their amenities. I would come back again in a year when it is more established and accessible.",3.0

4711,Fun day out with children,"Legoland was fun. ¬†They are still building it and the part that is open for public is not very big, smaller than Disneyland in HK. ¬†We hired a car from Singapore for RM500 ¬†for the day and it took us just an hour to reach Legoland. ¬†On the way back we encountered some traffic and it took us a longer time. ¬†It seems that it took longer to pass the Singapore custom than the Malaysian one. It takes 10 mins to drive from Legoland to HelloKitty/Thomas land.",4.0
4712,Great time for our family.,"We took the trip to Legoland from Singapore, which takes less than 2 hours with the bus and visa formalities are very simple.The park is new and offers many attractions, fun rides and all kinds of Lego buildings. We especially liked the roller coasters. The Lego Mindstorms workshop was also nice, but a bit too simple for kids who already have some experience with it. It would be good if they offer a basic and advanced course.There's a good variety of food and it's not too expensive. Overall it was good value for money. Once the MRT extension to the 2nd Link is complete, it'll be even better, because the bus ride is quite expensive compared to the entry fee.Make sure you bring umbrellas and sunblock though, there's not much shade.",4.0
4713,nice and relax,"First what is the meaning for the words LEGO. In danish it means LEG GODT. In English play good.Transport from JB : Red cab around 25 MYR one way. Blue Cab: 50 MYR one way.We where lucky with teh weather as there was little rain and not so much sun, and there was nearly no visitor at the park so our daughter on 6 years she try all the things she like several times, so lucky day for her. We saw all 3 4 D movie so it was perfect. For me I like off course Miniland, as I am born with Lego bricks. It is NOT the same like in Billund but ok. Still miss more Lego product in the shop. There was more Lego friends, City in Toys R us in Hong Kong. find teh food prices very good compare with Universal and Disneyland",4.0

This is a nice enough park but it really is aimed at young children. Even my nine year old daughter was really a bit old for many of the rides. It has a lovely miniland but even though it is only a few months old, maintenance issues are staring to show. For example, there was rubbish in some of the minliand displays, models knocked over or smashed. The paving in the park is also cracked and showing signs of wear.I think 2 hours would be enough for most families.",3.0

4717,Loads for kids. .Little for adults.,We went there on a sunday and it was not crowded cos it was gloomy and cloudy. There was only like six rides for.adults and the others were mostly for.kids.

From.the parking to the entrance there is a long walk  and most of the rides are very short.most of the rides are for.kids . The park is also not.complete and i think the best would be to wait a while before visiting. ,3.0
4718,Wonderful destination!,"Legoland in Johor Bahru was an excellent place to visit with my 5 & 7 year old boys. We went in late February, so no lining up for any rides - ever!  If we wanted to stay on the roller coaster and not get off, be pretty well could.  A great time of year to visit with no crowds, and minimal rain.  We were lucky enough to be on the train ride during the only shower of the day.We arrived promptly for opening at 10am, and didn't even think of leaving until 6pm.Best rides: the large dragon roller coaster, and the technic roller coaster, as well as the jet boats where even those watching could interact and get people wet.There was only one ride that my 5 year old was unable to do, sadly, which was the log ride.  Always a winner, but it gives us an excuse to return in a year or two when the water park and hotel open.Food was pretty good, and a good range of asian/western to choose from.  Not too pricey.Shopping:  prices for Lego and assorted paraphenalia were comparable with everywhere else in the world.We are hoping that the park isn't left to fall to pieces as time goes on like the rest of Malaysia.  There were a few signs of poor maintenance already, and it as only been open for less than 6 months!  Fingers crossed they keep it clean and fresh.",5.0
4719,Family Fun,"My husband and I drove to Legoland  Johor Bahru during Chinese New Year. We intended to explore the park for our little one since he's still too small and also had fun on our own. It's defitnitely a great place for kids and family. I love the fire station point that is manual maneuver and required minimum 2 persons on board to help complete the rescue mission, as well as small lego cities which were built to resemble attractions in Malaysia. They look amazing. However, Food is very expensive and there is not enogh seat. One hot dog and drink cost 22 RM. The live performance was not that great either. Anyway we will make another trip with our son next time. The water park and hotel are going to be ready in 2014. We can't wait to visit there again.",4.0
4720,A long day but worth it.,"Visit January 2013 (outside Singapore School holidays) family with 6 & 8 year old. Our 8 year old boy is a Lego addict so part of a trip to Singapore included a day trip to Legoland. As set out below I try to set it out how it is. You definitely need to plan this excursion bu the kids will love it.Prior to your arrival in Singapore get your hotel to arrange the booking. The main tour operator is WTS in Singapore. When booking you need to send copies of passports etc and this is best done in advance. You need to fill out forms with all the passport details and specify the time of departure and return. It is essentially like checking in at the air port.The trip form singapore starts at the Singapore Flyer (ferris wheel) at the marina part of town. They will pick you up form your hotel at say 8.15am for the 9am departure bus. If you have prebooked no need to go into the WTS office, they have booths outside. You check into the booth and are allocated to a designated bus. They essentially put together a passenger list for the specific bus you are catching for immigration purposes. You are given a boarding pass type and tickets to legoland.You stand by the bus, the driver calls out your name and you board. Buses leaves and about 1/2- 3/4 hour later you arrive at Singapore immigration at the cause way. You get out of the bus, go through immigration. It is efficient but on a tuesday morning at 9.45am there was only three buses going through so the wait was short.You get back on the bus and drive across the cause way. You need to fill in the malaysian immigration card on the way. You get off the bus and go through Malaysian immigration. You get back on the bus and drive to lego land which takes about another half an hour. The bus stop is about 500m form the park entrance which has a covered walk way. On the left is a shopping mall with cafes, KFC, Burger King etc plus local Malay restaurants. No money changer. One ATM is also available but unlike those in Singapore it appeared that you could only take out cash advances on credit cards only. That said you can pay for everything inside Legoland in either Ringht or Sing dollars.Park opens at 10am. Just as you go past  the ticket gates there is a cafe and ATM machine plus a Lego store (don't buy just yet).Go over the the Lego Technics part of the park first. Reason is that you need to book your 40 minute Lego Technics building workshop as numbers are limited to12 each session. Fix up a time and then see the rest of the park in the interim. The rides are very well done for this reason. Each themed part of the park has two versions of any one ride. For instance in the castle area there is a small roller coaster that our 6 year old could go on. The was also a large roller coaster that our 8 year old could go on but which our 6 year old could not because of her height.Because of the timing of our visit the lines were not existent. Some rides the controllers simply let us stay in the ride and go around for a second (and in one case third) time with out getting off. That said go on a weekend or peak time and I imagine the lines could be horrible.After the ride you exit through a gift shop. Note some of what is in these gift shops are not back at the lego shop at the entrance. The gift shops are air conditioned so it is a good place to stop.It is very very hot and there is little shade. Our 6 year old started to get heat stroke about 1pm. There is a very good free medical centre within the park with trained nurses etc. She was given hydrating drinks and some oxygen. All worked out well after an hour.The restuarant/cafes in the park are air conditioned for a respite from the heat and humidity. The food would be considered expensive compare to local cafes but not out of the ordinary for a theme park in general. That said simply go back to the entrance and get stamped out. Walk across the plaza and have lunch in the mall were the food is very much cheaper.Be prepared for the rain deluge in the afternoon as it is in the tropics. Take shoes that can get wet both from the rain and the water based rides in the park. Crocs and the like are perfect for this.WTS give you a time allocated for the returning bus to Singapore. Ours was the first at 4.45pm. That was certainly enough time to do the whole of the park. Walk back 500m to the bus stop outside the park. Get called on as you did in the morning. Drive back to Malaysian immigration and get out. get back on the bus and cross causeway and fill in the Singapore immigration card on the way. Get off buss pass through immigration. Get back on bus after immigration. Bus hits peak hour traffic and takes about one hour plus to get to the flyer. Get back around 7pm to the flyer.Make sure you take your pen as you will be using it to fill in all those immigration forms constantlyLets be honest young kids love theme parks. But rides, long bus trips and  kids stomachs don't mix well. Make sure that you have a spare sick bag - plane sick bags are ideal.The lego land hotel adjacent to the park is still under construction. It will be fabulous when finished around the end of 2013. It sounds a lot of hassle - but it is one of things you do for the kids not yourself. Travel very light and with clothes that can get wet. Use plenty of sun screen and take water. Definitely go to Legoland before Universal Studios on Sentosa. They are chalk and cheese with Universal being a grown up's threme park with rides to match. That said while our 8 year old could go on all the rides at Universal our 6 year could not. Both got scared in some of the rides as well. No fear however at Lego land. Don't plan anything that night as both you and the kids will be absolutely exhausted when you get back to Singapore and to your hotel. Finally a big Tip for Universal Studios - pay extra to get the VIP tickets. What it means is that you get a straight path into the ride and by pass those who buy normal tickets who have to stand in long lines. Kids and lines do not mix so it is well worth spending the extra dollars not to have to wait.It may be up to 40% more for each ticket but you do not stand in line for up to an hour for a popular ride - just waltz straight in!",4.0
4721,Great place for kids,"The park is great for kids, as most of the rides are for them and it is made of lego. For adults, theres nothing much to do, just sight seeing. And good for photography. Food there is expensive and not worth the price. I went there with no kids, so it was just mediocre. not saying it was a waste of money, more of a one time thing for adults. nevertheless, good place for family with kids.",4.0
4722,I'm an adult and I liked it too,"On a recent trip to Johor we drove over to legoland.  Approaching by automobile I found the signboards on the road rather lacking considering this is the major attraction and major contributor to the economy in this part.  They really need more signs directing the driver.  That perhaps is not the fault of Legoland but perhaps whomever is in charge of highway signboards.  The parking at Legoland was easy, a small fee of 3 to 7 RM and the attendants were helpful and parking was plentiful. From there we were directed up a moving walkway to mall-like food court where I found the food to be varied and reasonbly priced for a theme park.  I went to a kiosk and bought corn kernels in a cup with margarine.  Then on to the ticket booths. The adult admission is 140 ringit, the children 110 ringit, but I qualified for the senior citizen discount, and I should tell you that we had a discount coupon from a bag of Mee that we purchased at the shop at a Petronas station along the road.  The coupon was worth 35% off and the bag of mee only cost 4ringit and was well worth it.  So it saved us 49 ringit...very cool.  Once in the park, we found rides...my favorite was the dragon roller coaster, but I also liked the other roller coaster style rides as well as the log-flume style water ride.  I loved the models of various cities and international attractions all built out of legos! Wow, gotta be impressed. They had petronas towers, downtown KL, Angkor Wat, the Taj Majal etc built out of legos.  The day we went, in celebration of Chinese New Year Year of the Snake, they were building ""the world's longest lego snake"" and anyone could participate by selecting little blocks of what seemed like tons of legos. Adults and children were occupied under a tent quite enjoying the task. Then we went up the observation tower for a couple of rotations to see the surroundings.   Really quite enjoyable, and I consider myself lucky that it was a cloudy /rainy day so not much heat and also no waiting on the rides.  Please consider carefully if you chose to go on a day when lines are longer if you can't stand the heat.  In a park like this with kids along one might wonder about toilet facilities and these I would rate 4 stars too, with ample toilets, toilet paper supplied, soap in the dispensers and towels/blowers to dry the hands and there are diaper changing tables available.",4.0
4723,100% worth a visit with children.,"I have just got back from Singapore for my son's birthday and we went over to Legoland in Malaysia for the day.The park is clean, organized and the queue's were short - just a fantastic day out - my son loved it.We used city tours from Singapore who collected us from the hotel on time and transferred us to the Malaysian boarder (around 45 minutes) they explained the procedures for the immigration etc and this was very very easy and 10 minutes after the boarder we were at Legoland - i would recommend using City Tours as everything was like clockwork.",5.0
4724,A Young But FunTheme,"We visited Legoland Malaysia on February 11, 2013.  The entrance fees for Adult is RM 140 and for Kid < 12 yrs old RM 110.  The fees includes all the rides inside the theme park.  The theme park management company have made many car park lots available for parking.  The theme is still young and we can see that there are still some construction going on the surrounding areas of the theme park.  As it was a public holiday on the day we visited, the queues were very long for some of the popular rides, Waiting could take up to 30 mins to 1 hour. Like all theme parks, food & souvenirs is least of your problem.  It is everywhere, however the food are not cheap.  There is also a 4D theatre inside the theme park.  Be prepared to take lots of pictures.",5.0
4725,Sidetrip,"During our Singapore Trip, we decided to sidetrip to Legoland, Malaysia as the newest attraction for a day tour. Since the place is new, there are still on going construction in the area even the Hotel. Malaysia's weather that time was very hot. It is recommended to bring hats or umbrella to cover your head to avoid headache. If you are not an outdoor person, it's not a place for you. We really had fun and we try to ride the Tower, boat ride and the train to go around the place. You will be amazed of the several countries they showcases that was made of Legoland blocks. Children would really love their toys. I will recommend Legoland to my friends since their are other attractions and rides in the park that they can only find in Legoland.",4.0
4726,Legoland Malaysia,"Its a perfect place for Lego lovers. It is an outdoor theme park features buildings and rides in Lego blocks shapes. Its advisable to bring along rain coat and extra clothes as you will get wet when playing the water games and rides but don't worried as it also provides body dryers. Don't forget your hat as its outdoor and not much shade. I think it should build more shades and seats to rest. Liked the Miniland, all buildings are so real.",4.0
4727,Best theme park in Malaysia,"I have been to Legoland several times with my family. Even though they have been on the main rides a few times now, there's always a couple of other new attractions to try out each time we visit. The place is well-run. The plaza outside the theme park is also a favourite - tons of food choices, and a great candy kiosk.Just remember to bring a cap, even an umbrella for extra protection from the sun.",5.0
4728,A Theme Park Disappointment,"We included Legoland in our itinerary being relatively new(opened only last year) to see what it's like. I was a little disappointed because it's more like a children's playground rather than a theme park. Anyway, we just made the most of our time by riding some of the challenging rides like the Dragon & the tower. We were also impressed by the miniland where miniatures of landmarks of Asian cities were displayed. There was also a 4D movie where we had to queue for almost 30 min to get in. It rained in the afternoon after a very hot morning & we couldn't sit on the sideseats of the covered walkway because they were wet from the rain. I hope the management will `extend the covering to include the seats so people can use them in case of rain or even from the heat of the sun especially while waiting for our bus to pick us up.",3.0
4729,An enjoyable and relaxing day out with family and friends,"Despite being new and relatively small-ish compared to other theme parks, the layout is friendly with attractions to cater for all ages. We loved Miniland with the amazing Lego models of the landmarks of Malaysia and Asia. The rides were so enjoyable especially when the crowd was thin, we even had the chance to ride the popular rides like the Dragon and Project X multiple times with the short queues. Food can be costly within Legoland, so do try the mall just outside the entrance. Toilets need to be cleaned more frequently considering the crowd.Ample parking space is available, although the surface should be fully tarred to avoid muddy puddles during rainy weather. ",5.0
4730,CNY in Legoland!,Very nice for everybody at any age! Expensive merchandises in the shop! We enjoyed good rides and as well as good food inside and outside! Prepare for hot weather after lunch time! have a small umbrella! It will be helpful in rain and sun!,5.0
4731,Lousy Theme Park (Not Worth the Money),"Bought annual pass for my family and my daughter (3.5 years old). I was thinking my daughter can play at least some simple ride..but to my surprise most of the even simplest ride she can't even ride because of the ridiculous height impose for those ride. Similar ride like the tea-cup and normal Lego train ride which my daughter can ride on in Universal Studio Singapore but not in Legoland Malaysia.For the money paid for the annual pass, I would rather spent it in Universal Studio! Legoland Malaysia is a Total Disappointment and totally family unfriendly. If I have know, I will Never spend the money to enter Legoland, it just don't worth a dime!! For the stuff that my daughter got to play, she can enjoy it in any decent playground in any park!!I don't even have the WOW feeling entering the theme park..I personally hope the park management would review the height limit for some of the simplest ride, it is just too ridiculous!!",1.0
4732,"Good experience for kids, not so much for the grownups","I wasn't very impressed by most of the rides - they were all not quite the adrenaline rush(es) I was hoping for. The weather was scorching hot and we found ourselves guzzling copious amounts of water just to stay hydrated. There was hardly any shelter available. The ""mini-Asia"" in the center was very well done, I found myself wishing to visit the actual places depicted in the park.Recommendation: Go for the rides first thing when you reach in the morning to beat the queues. Store your electronics in the lockers. You can always take pictures after you've had your fun with the rides.",3.0
4733,Family Experience,"The theme park itself is Ok, but the weather during our trip is not ok :( sad to say it rained in the afternoon but overall it was worth it. we didnt get the chance to have picture with any mascot i dont know why we didnt see one. but we definitely come back after the construction of the water park and the hotel.",4.0
4734,Great Times,"We are a family of 4, with 11 and 14 year old girls. Our older one was skeptical about Legoland as she had ""heard"" it was for little kids. Well, we all had a blast. I will admit the place is expensive, but in my opinion it was worth it.To me it was worth it even as a museum just to watch all the works of art produced using Lego pieces. There are many scattered all over the park, but I specially enjoyed the miniature cities at the center of the park. And if you have seen some of those in person, it is even more impressive to see the reproduction. They have the Petronas and KL towers, Wat Arun from Thailand, Angkor Wat from Cambodia, Taj Mahal, Myanmar, etc. Very very good job. Many of the reproductions have moving cars, planes, boats, cruises, etc.Then they have some rollercoasters and games. My kids enjoyed the coasters, the driving school, and putting a piece together for an ever growing snake that is being built around the park.It rained most of the afternoon but we each had umbrellas as suggested by these reviews. I would suggest leaving the 3D/indoor/building activities for when the sun is too much or it rains heavily. We visited from 10am to 6pm and wished we could have stayed for the fire works.This is not a big thrill park, but we combined it with Universal Studios Singapore the next day and I feel both parks had their charm and strengths, all in all a great weekend.",4.0
4735,Great place,"We went from Spore flyer using coach bus. The journey takes about 1.5 hours, with most of the time spent at the immigration on both sides. But the legoland itself is very good. The only negative side is that the place is so very hot, so don't forget to bring umbrellas or wear a good hat. Maybe in 1 or 2 years, when the trees are grown the heat will come down a little. My 6 yr old daughter enjoyed Legoland so much. tips: don't go on weekends, because the immigration queue is just murder, and the queue to popular rides at the Legoland will take as much as 45-60 minutes. And it is better to eat at the mall near the Legoland, because the food variety is better, at almost half the price. Don't forget your ringgit, because some places do not take credit cards.",4.0
4736,Small and boring,"Theme park was way too small. We finished most of the rides within the first half of the day.It doesn't help too that the rides lack a sense of originality. You can pretty much do the same thing and find the same stuff in any other run-of-the-mill theme park. Nothing spectacular.The design and architecture of the theme parks was also quite lacking. We were expecting the place to be filled with Legos. Instead, they just littered some lego structures and characters quite sparsely around the theme park. Not quite fitting to call it Legoland, in my opinion.To sum it up, if you want a proper theme park, go to the USS at Singapore or those in Hong Kong!",2.0
4737,Not worth the effort and money,"Rode the bus near the Singapore flyer at 7am.  The trip to Johor Bahru took about 2 hours, with about 20 mins waiting for the bus to get clearance in the border to exit Singapore.  The Singapore immigration office was efficient unlike the Malaysian immigration office where the staff seemed to be sleepy.  From the bus stop, you will walk about 300 meters to reach the Legoland entrance. To your left are food establishments where it is better to eat since food is about 50% cheaper than inside Legoland. Don't forget your ringgit when you eat ath KFC in that area.  They don't have a credit card facility. So we had to eat at Pancake House, a few stores away from KFC, which is way better.  The cost of Pancake house meals is the same as in the Philippines.  But service was poor.  My brother who travels a lot said that poor service is a given in Malaysia.  Anyway, when we reached Legoland, it was packed with people that cuing for a ride took 45-60 mins. Waiting was long because the rides could only accommodate a small number.  Anyway, my boys enjoyed the kart ride, fire extinguisher ride, roller coaster, etc.  There was only one 3d cinema so I don't understand why they did not make it 4d. Don't forget to bring your umbrella because most of the waiting area have no canopy.  The place was too hot because there are no trees. Sodas in can are expensive. I enjoyed taking pictures in the Asian landmarks made out of Lego.  I was just disappointed that they featured Bolinao as the Philippine landmark.  Have they forgotten that we have Banaue Rice Terraces, Chocolate Hills, etc? For S$58, I my visit to Legoland is not worth it especially when I compare it with my visit to Universal Studios in Singapore and Sentosa.",3.0
4738,We had a Blast!,"Wonderful place, worth every penny! We loved it here and love the rides! They're mostly for kids, but I find the rides too quick. Good thing there weren't a lot of people, so we didn't have to line up for the rides. Ok, too that they accept SG Dollars as well. Restaurant food is affordable, lego stuff prices are reasonable. Very clean, too. Will definitely visit again. ",5.0
4739,"Relive your memories as a kid, not the ones that you stepped on Legos","Visited on a Saturday, 2nd February 2013.Bought the tickets online, direct from the LEGOLAND website.

We were just a tad too late.Anyhow, decided to drive up and the journey took less than 20mins from the JB Customs to LEGOLAND (: *big plus!Carpark was huge, lots of parking space but its open air which means its a little inviting to robbers and nasty people.Visited the park, great kiddy rides that weren't too scary. Park is clean, with plenty of toilets (: The rest, I will leave it to you to judge during your visit.",4.0

We checked out the Lego miniland to see the minature landmarks made our of Lego. Impressive !!!It was a super sunny day..so pls bring your caps, sunglass & umbrella.All the rides were good too. There were 2 roller coasters (Big & small). The only ride we couldn't go was the boat which slides down from a height. There was technical glitch so was under maintenance.Food wise...plenty of options avail. We ate at Market place. Prices reasonable for the food portion.It'll take a whole day to explore the whole place. The lego store was expensive but offers something for all ages.",4.0
4742,Legoland!,"Pro- not only for kids! Traveled as a couple and we had a lot of fun.- lego is always fun. They have build sites, and workshops for building robots and other stuff.- easy access from singapore. We pre-booked coach tickets from WTS for 10sgd/way/person and they took care of the transfer - all we had to do was show up at the singapore flyer 15mjns before our departure.- lego sets 25% cheaper than in other stores. (Star wars set in Phils P12k - only around P8k in legoland)- they had 7 restaurants and lots of snack shacks with varied food choices. Price per meal around (chicken and rice) 12sgd, (8""pizza) 15sgd, and soda at 2sgd/cup.- you can pay with SGD but they'll give you RM as change. - awesome attractions and rides. The place is around as big as universal studios in singapore.- not too many people were there. went on a friday, only waited around 5mins in line for rides.Cons- dress for comfort. It was hot!- there are still some attractions being developed that we wished we could have seen.- nothing else to see in that part of johor.",4.0
4743,small in size but packed with fun!,"I visited Legoland Malaysia with very little expectation, I heard it was small in size, hot and very dirty. But I only arrive to find everything opposite of what people claim to be!Yes, the place is small in size, even smaller than Hong Kong Disneyland, but it is packed with fun, each ride is creative and enjoyable not just for kids but also for adults! And don't let the small size fool you, the place is actually filled with different rides and attractions, and there are countless Lego figure all around the park hiding to play a game of Easter egg hunting with you. Yes it was Hot, i mean VERY HOT, especially during 1-3pm. I recommend to choose indoor rides during this 2 hrs (4D cinema, the indoor shooting game), but with relatively low number of visitors in the park, the hot weather isn't so much of a problem for me.4 of us aged from 26 to 32 enjoyed an 8-hours fun in the park and enjoyed every moment of it, you should too get into the action!Tips:1) Bring LOTS of water, it is hot, very very hot. Although buying water in the park is actually quite inexpensive - RM2.5/each2) Tune Hotel Danga Bay have shuttle service to the park, RM15/person3) If you don't want to take a shuttle, rent a car, you can rent one for RM100/day. Parking is RM7/day at Legoland.4) Fill yourself up before going, not much food option in the park, there are a few fast food joint outside the park in the mall.5) Buy your tickets 21-days in advance through Legoland's website to save yourself RM30/person!",5.0
4744,legoland ... worth visiting ...,"the concept is quite interesting ...who wouldn't be so excited to be around ""giant"" lego block in a big block kingdom.it is like walking in a wonderland ...i spent a whole day watching the block one by one and felt like to see thoroughly every single work. it's a real piece of art.don't forget to bring your umbrella, or at least a cap to cover your head cause it's so hot ...it would be a lot nicer if they build more sitting area with green and shady interior as the park so big.all i can say legoland is a real hot stuff ....literally and figuratively ...",4.0
4745,Not just for little kids,We visited Legoland during our stay in Singapore.I booked tickets online with Superior Buses which was easy to do and included bus travel to and from Legoland and entry to the park.The bus trip took a little longer than I had expected.We had a great day we went on a weekday and it was not Malaysian or Singaporean school holidays so we only had to wait for the rides to come back in which was fantastic.There was enough rides and activities to do even though it is aimed at under 12s.  The Lego for sale is very expensive.  We thought the restaurants etc were reasonable and had a good variety.  If you don't find any food to your test there is a small mall across from the entrance with a great variety.  We actually had lunch at the Pancake ?House I think.  But we had afternoon tea and snacks from inside the park.We had an awesome day there and would definitely visit again.,4.0
4746,Great for kids of all ages,"We took a daytrip from Singapore by bus to visit this park on a Monday. The travel itself is only 2 hours each way but the immigration and customs on both sides are a pain when you have a few kids but such is the world we live in that this is necessary. The park itself was not busy on a weekday and according to some of the staff it is always much quieter Mon-Thurs. The upside to this was no queues for anything, no waiting, no boredom and no wishing that you'd gone somewhere less busy. All of the rides are in gret condition and the various lands within Legoland make for continuous excitement and activity. We tried a few of the sideshows designed to make you part with some additional cash and then ate at a couple of the restaurants. All good, nothing bad to say at all about this place. Yes it is hot but as Australians we weren't bothere, had plenty of sunscreen, hats and water, the occassional ice lolly and a bit of aircon every now and then. No beer so if you feel like a cold one you have to wait until you get back home.",5.0
4747,Fun but Hot,"My friend bought 3 online promotion ticket for us last month. We decided to visit Legoland during Thaipusam weekend holiday. Before we went there, do remember to bring big umbrella with you as Malaysia weather was hot for the whole year. Not to forget to use sunblock or you can wear long sleeve shirt/pant. All the games and rides were quite fun. I think it would be impossible to play all, so we decided to skip those rides for kids. The miniland was a nice view where you can take picture with different angle.Talking about the Legoland models, i was impressive with it. Food was expensive inside and we went to Mall of Madini to have our lunch.",3.0
4748,Fun! Fun! Fun!,We're annual pass members for Legoland. So lucky that we bought it in advance. Now the price is increased. My children had lots of fun over there. Will surely return again.Lots of attractions for kids and adults alike.My advise is should visit during  weekday so there wasn't much of a queue for all the rides.,5.0
4749,a place for family,"i am an annual pass member for legoland. Well, please visit legoland during low season where it is not public holiday and school holiday in malaysia and singapore. the ticket is expensive for 1 day pass if you unable to make full rides on all games and take photoes at all attractives/lego models in legoland. i been there for 5 times with my friend's kids and we love it very much. most of the annual pass visitors are from singapore and johor and they normally visit during school holiday and public holiday. if possible , please go during weekday or weekend of after school holiday. i am sure you will enjoy all the rides and taking photographies. the trees are all very small. Hence, the park is still very hot. please bring your own 1.5L mineral water for each coz the foods and drinks are expensive. anyway, i still think that this is a park that visitor must visit in malaysia if you never compare it with other park such as universal studio(singapore),hong kong disneyland(hong kong) and korea lotte world(korea).",4.0
4750,"Pretty Fun, but Arggh‚Ä¶ Umbrella!!","Almost canceled this trip after reading reviews here, but I already bought the tickets, so I went through‚Ä¶We went on Jan 02, hired a van from Singapore.  All went smooth, no queue at both Immigration. We reached Legoland less than 1.5 hour. Arrived at 10:30 expect to meet huge crowds. But, lucky me, there was almost no crowd at all. They said that because the Malaysia and Singapore student had already back to school.  We only need about average 5 minutes for each ride, except for 4D which we only wait for 10 minutes. Even there was no queue at all for some rides. My good day? Maybe. But it was way too empty for a theme park to create the holiday atmosphere.Location : in the middle of nowhere. Nothing surrounds except the connecting Medini Mall.The rides : All rides aimed especially for younger children (5-12 yo). No real thrill here. The most interesting rides for me are the Dragon, the Dino, and the 4D cinema. In the Lego City Zone, they have shows at Lego Rescue Academy, Lego City Airport, and Lego City stage that are educated and fun. I only watch half length of the Lego City show, it‚Äôs too hot to sit in the non aircon space.However, the Miniland is fantastic. This is the best area in this entire park. There are interesting places in Asia, eg Clarke Quay SG, Angkor Wat Cambodja, Forbidden City China, Tanah Lot Bali, etc. They‚Äôd made it very detailed (although I don‚Äôt know whether all made of Lego brick or special custom brick, who knows). But again, I think they made a little bit too much of miniature Malaysia places here IMHO.The park : it is very hot with no / only a few shaded areas, and the weather can change suddenly from a very hot into heavy rain. Talking about hot, it‚Äôs very very very hot. Trust me, I‚Äôm from Jakarta which also hot, I know very well about hot so I can guarantee you what I‚Äôm saying. That said, when the sun out you will be baked in scorching sun, but when the rain comes, everyone will rush into the restaurant, store, etc.  I felt very exhausted, soaked, and lost of mood after 3 hours, can‚Äôt imagine how it‚Äôs in the peak day. Even my 8 yo son lost his mood to try the Driving School. And also, the park is lack of decoration ornaments compared to USS in Singapore. Food  : Bring as much water as you can. They don‚Äôt allow you to bring any outside food but they didn‚Äôt check my backpack either. If you need some food, you can go forth and out to Medini Mall which is better and cheaper as long as you have the stamp and bring your tickets. The Lego prices are similar compared to Singapore and Jakarta. No need to buy anything from here except one or two keychains for souvenir.Overall, it is a good theme park, but could be better in the next few years after the trees are growing up and the hotel / water park construction is done. Up to now, I prefer go to USS.",4.0
4751,Expensive!,"The price charged is leaning heavily toward exorbitsnt for the level of attractions they have inside. To make it worse, the food outlets also charge a hefty price. A plate of chicken rice for RM30?? It's not even Michelin star quality!It seemed to us that the Management is trying to milk all they're worth from foreign tourists which is unfair to both the foreigners AND the locals who can't pay as much for their kids to enjoy a smaller version of the original Legoland.Getting to Legoland was also confusing with lacking directional signages where it really mattered to first timers. That's even with GPS! My friends and I wished we could replace the marketing team too. We're not marketers but we know we can do better!",3.0

Quite a boring theme park.",3.0
4754,Good fun for big kids,"The staff are all over the top friendly and very helpful. It does all seem a bit staged though. This place is very much a concrete jungle.

4755,A great place for the family,"We found out about Legoland a few months before we were to travel to Malaysia so we decided to make a trip there.I was a bit weary about it as I haven't read a lot of good reviews on it. Turned out I didn't have to as we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.Don't compare it to Universal Studios in Singapore and you will be fine.It was a Saturday and we didn't have to wait more than 10 minutes for any one ride.We took our son who is 5 years of age and he had a blast. Although we were a bit disappointed that he wasn't tall enough for the Dino Island ride, which we still find hard to understand. He was allowed on the different roller coasters which looked worst.The place was very well done. Staff were friendly. As for the hot weather... it wasn't unbearable.",4.0
4756,It's All About Lego,"Happened to be lucky enough, it was shady and cloudy while we were there. Seriously, you will be melted if you were there during sunny time. It was not during peak season, thus we could try all the rides without spending much time for waiting. Frankly speaking, those roller coasters there weren't that exciting or thrilling, but wise choice for first-timers. Less fun but still.Overall it's well facilitated. Toilets are extremely clean. Especially those dryers provided, you can just pay RM5 to dry your clothings right after those rides which would get you all wet.Do remember, by holding your entrance pass, you are allowed to exit and re-enter the park as many time as you want. I found the food sold there was quite high-priced, thus we had our lunch at KFC, outside the Legoland. Paid less, but still yummy.",4.0

I pre booked tickets the day before but there were no queues for tickets or any of the rides. UNBELIEVABLE!!!. The park is still very new so it's immaculate and the staff were very friendly. The rides were fun, a little on the tame side so for kids above 10 it might be a little boring. Food options were pretty good. They had lots of healthy options like fruit, sandwiches and ribena.

We explored almost the whole place but had to leave by 5pm, so we missed out on only 1 small section.The rides were really great for young kids.  Older kids (and adrenaline-junkies) will consider the rides too mild.  My kids (aged 8 and 10) really liked the foam balls and the driving academy.  Food was okay (we ate at the market restaurant).Do bring and drink lots of water.  Also bring sunscreen and hats.We might go back, but will have to do that before the kids get too jaded and too big for the rides!",4.0
4761,Big Legoland in Little Malaysia,Kids love Legoland! So do the young and old! Here we have a good choice of rides and attractions though the entrance is a tad pricey.

I for one don't mind going there for the third time.,5.0
4762,Don't forget a hat,"As we were holidaying in Singapore, we added legoland to the list of things to do. We bought tickets online with wts travel. We met them at the Singapore flyer and everything was easy. Catching their bus, we got off at both the singapore and malaysian immigration points, checked through customs and then before we knew it, were at the legoland entrance. Staff are friendly and access is easy. If you want a locker, make sure you have the right denominations. If you don't and you ask for change from the legoland shop inside the park, you will need to purchase something befor they will give you the denominations you need (depending on your rental period). This park is great for kids up to about the age of 11, any older and they may get bored after a while? The place is hot and lacks shade so don't forget a hat and sunburn cream. You'll thank me later. There are plenty of places around the park for snacks and refreshments so water is no problem. Toilets are clean and well maintained as well. The 4d films are a nice break from the heat. Move down to the furtherest door as this will lease you into the first row of the cinema. Once youre in and the movie finishes, you are free to stay seated and watch the next film without having to leave and come back around to the doors. The miniature models are fantastic and I was amazed at the detail they had. Leave your shopping until the end of your day. Wts travel will also pick you up at the park and bring you back to Singapore. They have a number of options available in terms of the time you ant to return so check out their website. Was certainly worth the visit and we are glad we took our here little ones (9,8 and 6) there.",4.0
4763,Great place for kids,"We went on a school holiday and on a busy saturday. I have one x 2 year ++ kids and one six years old boy, together with my brother and sis in law, 4 year old son and my mother. We expected a crowded day so didnt expect we get to play anything. Just spend time with the kids. The que for any rides or attraction are extremely long, approx. 1 hr for certain attraction.Thus, mostly spend time for the kids. All adult didnt get to enjoy any rides..... IT was real hot.",3.0
4764,Nearly there.,"Three families, 6 adults and 7 kids aged from 2 to 11 years, have just had a great day out at Legoland on the 20/01/13. We arrived at 10am and there were no queues at the entrance. Paid and straight in. Luckily we had vouchers for free kids with all paying adults so that made it more affordable. The entrance fee for 2 adults was RM280. It would have been cheaper per adult to book online but you cannot combine online booking with free child entry vouchers so this worked best for us. If you don't have vouchers you should definitely book online.We visited most of the rides in the park and all the children had a great time. The roller coasters are fairly gentle and our 4 and 5 year olds all rode the Dragons in Legoland Kingdom as well as Project X and enjoyed them. They probably are too tame for teenagers.The children also partook in the Legoland driving school which was great fun. Unfortunately there was a 30 minute queue for the boat school so we gave it a miss. This was the only sizable queue we encountered all day.When we visited Legoland the weather was very cloudy and it remained so all day which was a blessing. There is not much shade there and if it had been a very sunny day there would have been little respite from it.We all ate in the pizza restaurant. The food here is ok. It fills a gap and keeps you going. For RM58 we got a large pizza, 4 sprite and a ribena so it's not bad value.Most of the staff were happy smiling and helpful. Staff on the rollercoasters were happy to hold my camera and even take pictures for us while I took my daughter on the  ride.Our one bad experience was in the Legoland Kingdom on the Royal Joust ride. Four of the younger children in our group went on this ride and enjoyed it immensely. After it was over they wanted to go on it again. At the time there was no queue waiting at all for the ride but the attendant said no they had to get off and go out and come in again. When the parents present pointed out how ridiculous this was he relented - kinda. He allowed 3 children to go again but refused to allow my daughter aged 4 to proceed with her friends. There was no explanation for this irrational behavior and my daughter was in floods of tears. After a few minutes the guy relented and said she could go and join her friends but by then it was too late. This was the only bad experience we had all day in what was otherwise a very enjoyable day out. I would highly recommend Legoland for a fun day out. We were very lucky that it was so quiet on the day we visited and would definitely return again.We were approached on the way into the park by a guy offering to sell online vouchers to us at a reduced rate. This is a scam and if you buy a ticket from this guy it will not be honored by Legoland. Don't get caught.",4.0
4765,"Good attractions, waiting areas need improvement","In general very good attractions, world class, hopefully they maintain it well as Maintenance in Malaysia is often a major concern. Waiting areas need major improvement. If you go on a busy day there are very few fans, covered areas. So when it is +32C, you are baking in the heat with hundreds of people getting hot, sweaty and frustrated. The shops are quite expensive though, I think a bit overpriced. Need maybe some more indoors activities to get a break from the heat, Malaysia and JB are always extremely hot so it would be nice to cool off sometime.",3.0
4766,It could be better,"Bought our tickets when we reached there cos I want to use the Double Decker crackers promotion. The tickets cost us RM91 each adult (35% discount from the original ticket RM140). You can buy the crackers sold in Malaysia and remember to cut the small promotion corner of Legoland behind the pack. There were 3 of us going and we saved a lot through this promotion. We went on a cloudy day and we still get sunburnt. Luckily we had a cooler fan with us (bought from Universal Studio Singapore) and we saw plenty of them sold inside there too for RM50. The quality of USS fan is better cos it comes with a strap. It is a life saver when you need it to cool down your body heat. Remember to put some sunblock lotion on every part of your body especially the exposed part. I forgot my exposed back shoulder and it is burning red now. We enjoy walking around the Miniland and taking photos. There is a Lego train bringing us around the park. When you go to the Imagination, remember to go up the rotating tower to have the aerial view of Legoland. You will enjoy this for sure. After this, you can watch the 4D show in another building beside. Please don't put high expectation for the show- the chairs are not moving and not much 4D effects compared to USS. Another show called The Loudest Show is a waste of time, nothing interesting, maybe it is interesting for some but not us. We saw many kids having fun inside the park especially the driving school and the indoor air-con lego building academy. Better bring the kids here when the new water theme park opens. Maybe more fun and worth the expensive entry.  The Lego souvenirs sold are too expensive. One lego brick attached with a keychain costs RM12.95. I think that is the cheapest souvenir sold there. Maybe there is other cheaper one but I didn't really look around.   We saw the banner stated that the water theme park will be ready this year and the Legoland Hotel will be opened in 2014. Maybe it is worth waiting and going again.",3.0
4767,Fun for all ages,"Legoland has rides for everyone! and I mean everyone! Fun and interactive rides for Kids, teens, a few roller coaster rides for adrenaline junkies and even for kids, calm and breezy rides for elderlies and as a family, a few splash of water rides. A few places to get food, so don't worry about starving in there (although it is cheaper to buy outside of legoland). There are playgrounds for little kids. The amazing part of legoland would be the miniature town. You would be impressed. It's magnificent! Another thing, there's a class (robotic class maybe) for children but you have to sign up early. They offered limited sessions with limited seats. It's located at the Lego Academy building ( the one with lego-made Einstein)For Muslims, there are one or two prayer space with telekung provided.A few tips. 1) you can bring raincoat or just buy one there( not sure how much it cost) if you are planning to board the water rides2) If possible, avoid school holiday. You are going to enjoy a whole lot more when there's only a small crowd.3) Bring food and drinks- just to save some money4) If you have lots of bags, rent a stroller. who cares if it's design for children=p 5) if it's a hot day, wear a cap and sunglasses. You're gonna do a lot of walking under the sun.Have fun!!",5.0

The things that it needed improvement was it lacked live shows (only one) and did not have a Main Street dancing, music show as in Disneyland. The new water park and hotel is opening at the end of 2013 so that would be a welcome addition.",4.0
4769,Long queue for weekend,"The park itself is really new, quite a lot of attractions for my boy. We really must visit it on weekdays, as it is really frustrating when queuing for rides. When the weather are hot, there'sn't much shady area to rest.Well, more plannng is at work :-)",3.0
4770,Good Times,Took a shuttle from Singapore Flyers with a fair cost to Johor Baru in Malaysia..it's a short trip but when you stay over in Singapore make sure carry only what you need since you need to go in & out of the bus for custom check.The legoland itself is a very neat & very hot place with not many places where you can find cool down (my case it was raining).I like the place & so were my wife & children but i think it would be great if Legoland  would make combo between Sanrio and LegoLand.Overall : worth the money and trip but Wait until 2014 where all the trees are higher & much more attraction.,4.0
4771,Perfect Trip!,"One day trip with 2 children under 10 y.o from SG on 11 Jan '13, local holidays were over. A whole cloudy day, *best forecast by weather.com. No queue at all, yes, repeat, no queue. We took most of the favourite rides by 3-4 times. Staff were friendly and helpful. Parks were clean and neat.Tips are plan your dates to visit, avoid weekend and local holidays. *watch weather forecast :) We took west / 2nd link route to enter Johor Bahru from SG. From Jurong East Bus Interchange, took CW3 bus (4S$ Adult, 2S$Children) to CIQ (Malaysia Immigration). Then took JPO2 bus (08.30 and 10.30 am only, 2RM Adult, 1RM Children) to Legoland. Shortest-Fastest. Go back to SG by LG1 bus from Legoland to Gelang Patah Terminus (2RM Adult, 1RM Children) and took CW3 from Gelang Patah back to Jurong East (4RM Adult, 2RM Children. Cheaper fare to go back to SG).",5.0
4772,Mixed feelings.,Brought 3 young kids and the oldest at 8yrs old got bored after about 3hrs here. So I'd say break it up if you can. Not that many rides that will challange older kids but it's nice to walk around and marvel at the architecture. It's really hot so bring a hat or umbrella.Pretty crowded and I went on a weekday! Lots of schools bringing their students there for an outing so you might have to wait quite a while for the popular rides.Food and drink prices inside are pretty high considering that you can get much cheaper right outside the gates. Just get a stamp on your hand for a return visit and head out to eat and buy drinks.,3.0
4773,Legoland with Friends,"I booked tickets on a deal site with friends at SGD 58 each which includes coach transfer from SG to Legoland and back. We reached there at around 9.30 am when the park is not opened yet. Hence, we headed to the nearby Mall of Medini for breakfast. We were there on a saturday and the park opens at 10 am to 8pm on weekends. As we got our tickets from a tour agency, we do not need to queue. I would recommend those without kids to start touring the park in a clockwise direction. We tackled the more exciting rides first which is THE DRAGON and PROJECT X. They were quite fun and for the adults, these 2 rides are basically the most exciting rides the park has to offer now. The other more exciting ride would be Dino Island which is similar to Rapids Adventures at USS, and this is a ride that will definitely get you wet! A lot of the rides there are for kids only but we had our fair share of fun at rides that allows adults to accompany their kids. Like the Boating Academy and Rescue Academy are both quite fun and great for those young at heart. My friends and I were practically stuck at the Mini land for at least an hour. The many architectures built with lego simply caught our hearts.  Took many photos there! One thing about legoland is that there are many staff there who will help you take your photos with your own cameras and you will only have to allow them to take your photos with their camera too. No harm, since we're not force to buy the official photos anyways. There's also many of those fun fair stalls around for you to try your luck at winning prizes. My guy friends managed to win the huge teddy bears for their girlfriends at the basket ball stall. That is one stall that is quite feasible so you guys can try your luck there! Some stalls are quite impossible to win but some has high chances so you have to judge for yourself. You have to pay from RM 10 to 15 for a game. But they were offering the games at RM 20 for 3 rounds at some stalls. No harm trying! We tried the pizza place near Imagination I think and it's not that bad. Pretty ok and reasonable for a family combo for RM58 for 4 persons considering it's in a theme park. Waiting time for the rides are pretty ok, ranging from 5 to 20 minutes for most of the rides. We even managed to go on the rides twice in a row when there's no queue at all. :PFor family with kids, please do check the height requirements for the rides as I've seen many kids being rejected at some rides. You won't want to disappoint your child at a theme park right? Do bring sunblock, shades and caps as the sun there is poisonous! It's scorching hot there that we don't mind getting wet at all by taking the Dino Island ride thrice! If you're looking for thrills and excitement then this might not be for you. But if you are just looking at some fun time with a bunch of friends (young at heart ones) , this is a good place to go at least once. XD",4.0
4774,don't visit on weekend/holiday,"We go there on weekend and it is very.. very long queue, don't choose weekend....it is a mistake.... We can only played just 2 or 3 attraction, what a waste time....and inside it is very humid and very hot because there're not much shelter and the trees are still small...",3.0
4775,Just have fun!,"Traveling with a 11 years old daughter, we all have so much great time. We had been to CA Carlsbad Legoland before my daughter turns 2, until today she still remembered the fun she had, proud of her driving license she got in CA. So, we brought her to this newly and nearby legoland before she turns 12 (some rides are for age below 12), first ride was driving school where she got her ""driving license"", it's cost RM25, but for her is the joy and memory for the next many years to come, this is priceless. After heard and reading all the bad reviews, we came in fully prepared ourselves for the weather, service, food, queue and even toilet. You know what, we have no problem at all. The rain and sun won't stop us for having fun. The employees are friendly even sometime hardly understand what they were trying to say (hey, we had been to Japan,all the theme parks only spoke Japanese and we still had so much fun even we didn't understand a word). The pizza that we had at pizza mania was thin and crispy which we all love it so much. No queue anywhere, oh yeah, it is Sunday. And be fair, I visited few locations of their toilets, no bad smell, few air fresheners installed in the restroom. When we came in least expectation, and what we received is full of fun and joy. Be positive and have fun. Your bad mood may ruin your child(ren) priceless memory!Few tips:Don't visit during long weekend, public holiday or school holidayNo exclusive lego sets, for those sets they are selling, the price is way too expensive. I can simply get those very cheap during local department store sales. Bring cap, poncho, umbrella, water, sun block, portable fan.",5.0
4776,Legoland-lite,"I'd been to the  original Legoland in Denmark, so knew what to expect when I visited here on a day trip from Singapore.  I found the crowds daunting, even on a weekday, and the lack of shade made the going tough.  The wait for the rides quickly ballooned out to 60mins for most attractions.  Be aware that there are insane height restrictions on some rides - and you will not find out until you get to the load in.  I had to console our 6 year old who missed a relatively tame log flume ride at the 11:59:58 hour (yet she was fine to do a much wilder version in Jurassic Park at Universal Studios???)Also, understand that the multiple border formailites will take time - our bus waited, but we held them up when a slow moving Malaysian Imiigration official took her sweet time with the four people ahead of us...I know it is a lot further away, but if you are a Lego fan, save up and go to Billund.",2.0
4777,Bring an umbrella! or a cooler mini fan!,It was a mistake going there during the school holiday and peak period. Long queues at all attractions and rides. We only took 1 train ride and that after waiting and queuing  for 90mins! I wish Legoland Malaysia would offer an express pass package. The weather is very hot! Luckily there's stalls selling cold ice drinks. We arrived at 11am and found out that the stroller rental has no more stock.Bring a good quality camera because you don't want to miss playing photographer in the Miniland section. Everything is so mini and cute :) ,4.0
4778,Great Fun,Have been here twice now from Singapore.  The place is fresh and new and is great fun for little kids.  The annual pass is good value if you are from Malaysia or Singapore.  Definitely worth a visit but get there early as it gets incredibly hot by just after lunch.,4.0
4779,Could be better if the vicinity has been developed,"The park itself was small but fun enough for kids. Build and test area allows you to build your own car and race with others. How nice! Rides were to the mild side, great for small kids. No lines at all for all rides, maybe it's because our visit was not on a school holiday. Close to Singapore with only 1-1/2 hours coach ride including customs. Food not bad especially the pizza. Kids were crazy at the Lego shop but price were steep! An interesting touch was the photo purchase, you may make the pic into a Lego brick wall (RM150) including a 8R pic, we loved it.There was a hotel under construction nearby, a small shopping area and nothing... Could be better if all the supporting facilities were finished.The park itself is not suitable for teens who love thrilling rides but good enough for us with a 10-year-old boy.",5.0
4780,Very quiet.  Good clean park.  Great day.,"This park is a bit painful to get to from Singapore, but it was a great day.  The park is brand new, so there is not much shade from trees yet.  Thankfully there are a couple of water based rides as it was VERY hot the day we went.  Our kids are 8&10 and they could go on every ride.We couldn't find any healthy food around the park.",5.0
4781,Great Place To Go If You Are Bored Of Singapore,"Brought my family there on a Friday last week, including my 5 year old boy. We wanted to drive there but were worried about car theft and also were not familiar with the roads there. In the end, we bought the packge online with wts travel. Surprisingly, it only took 45 min to reach there from singapore flyer.I thought it would be more of of theme park for kids, but not so! sure enough, the rides were not as exciting as universal studios, but some were pretty fun as well. of cos, there are some games which some would consider childish, but a good way to enjoy yourselves with your kids and family. Food and souveniers are not cheap, and there's little shade, so prepared lotsa sunblock and cap. Overall, nice place to go to, especially for Singaporeans.around 60 sing dollars for transport and 1 whole day in a theme park is pretty affordable.and you can easily spend the whole day there. Lastly, the lego mini-cities and figurines are pretty cool. lego fans and those who played lego before would surely like it.so if you are free any weekends,u should jus go!",5.0
4782,Fun new excitement,It was fun especially for the children as legoland has provided exciting games and the lego built was superb. I especially love that the muskim prayer rooms and the rest room which is very convenient and friendly for family with babies. Love it..but the costs are a little too expensive.,4.0
4783,"Well, good-bye Genting Highland...","If you are looking for a detail review on Legoland Malaysia, please read my first review dated in September 2012. It has information on direction (from Singapore), prices (food, mahines, license etc), baby facilities, parking suggestion etc. Our family of 2 adults and 3 children (age 6, 4 n 1) had been to Legoland 5 times since it opened door last year. Yes, we bought the annual pass and sure make it worth. Am planning to bring the kids again in 2 weeks time. In this review, I am going to add more of the observations from the past 3 visits. TripAdviser only allow one review on same location every 3 months. Hope this summary will provide more insight to Legoland Malaysia.Our 3rd visit was on the eve of public holiday. Wrong move! It was really crowded. Took my son 1 hr 45 min to enter the driving school for a less than 10 min fun. We ended letting them try one ride and then, go for one round of ball games and then drove home. The toilet smelled even though the cleaners had tried hard to keep up the cleanliness. Advise - avoid peck time if you can!Our 4th visit was on an evening. Legoland only open late (till 8pm) during school/public holidays. We were on the way home from Melaka, so took a stop for kids to let loose on the long ride. It was an idea place for kids to run before another long ride home. It was our first time visit in the night. Like my 1st review mentioned, the parking lots are well lighted. In the park, lightings are sufficient to walk around. But not all the miniatures are well lighted. Thus, couldn't see the details of those without lights. It was a fun experience to see the lighted miniatures in the night. Worth a visit in the night. However, we did notice that they closed down some rides (for example, the train ride) around 7:30pm that day. Of course, it was a school holiday, the park was crowded again. Anyway, we just let the children run wildly in the playground area before a nice dinner at Medini Mall.  Look like there were more eateries opened since the last time we went there. New eateries such as Pancake House International, Chicken Rice Shop etc. We ate lunch at Chicken Rice Shop during our 5th visit. It costs about RM52.00 for a triple feast set - 3 bowl of rice, 3 drinks, 1 stir fry veggies, 1 mix veggies with tou foo and egg, 2 different chicken dishes, 1 deep fry spring roll and 1 soup with veggies and fish ball). This provides enough food for our family since my kids aren't big eater for lunch. Their set menu starts at RM 13.99. Not the best service as they were quite slow even with less crowd. Mistake on our order but food wasn't too bad. Since this was a non school/public holiday, there was way less crowded in Legoland. We were there for about 4 hours (wanted to avoid traffic jam on the way home, so we leave early). Kids got to rides at least 10 different rides with some repeating rides. Also, watched a movie and spent 10 min in the test n build area. However, the lego (non-moving) cars near the Junior Driving area were removed. I hope they will put them back as my baby love to ride on those stationary cars. Baby too young to ride on moving ones. This time, I saw someone using the body dryer. In my previous review, I mentioned about it but not sure how it work. Family went into this machines with their wet cloth on, the machine just blow dry them up. Look like it work quite well as the family seemed to be happy with it. If you have young kids, better to held on to them as the effect might scare them. Again many thanks to the Legoland employees. They were pretty good in service, at least with those we encountered so far. My 2nd one rode on the horse for 4 times straight! Each time, he completed a round, the employee would ask if he wanted another round He even let my baby sat on the horse with the older for a photo taking and a few minutes of fun (without moving. Baby too young to ride). Remember, it is non-peck period, no other children were in the line. Since we purchase the annual pass, we had decided not to go Genting Highland anymore. Beside the long distance drive, the smoking environment is also a concern for us. So, having Legoland so near and so children friendly, we shall bid our farewell to Genting Highland! Pardon me for repeating - Legoland is built for children 2-12 year old, rides aren't exciting for older ones. Enjoy and have a safe & Fun time there!",4.0
4784,What a Legoland Malaysia.,"If you are driving there you have to be very patient with the road signs as only very small signs were put up, probably a few kilometers from LEGOLAND. Else travelling from JB city is going to be tough. Public transportation there is non-existence with the exception of buses from hotels or private chartered.The rides in LEGOLAND must be given a thumbs up although at times the queues are irritating with most visitors queuing under the scorching sun! Be patient with staff members that are not competent in the English language. The miniatures of iconic buildings worth the snaps on your camera!Lego shops there are well organized but too small for the overall number of visitors. The price of items are comparable/similar to the ones outside in the city. So don't bother to buy in there and then have to carry it home! The range of models for sale is extremely disappointed!Facilities for the disabled? None!Overall its an enjoyable place. If you are buying an annual pass, be extremely patient with LEGOLAND as they don't intent to give you the card! They only want to give you a very small piece of temporary slip for you future visits! Shame!",3.0
4785,"If Disneyland is the happiest place on earth, then Legoland is the hottest!","We had a few days in Singapore, and had originally planned to visit Universal Studios with our kids 10, 9 and 6. However we read that Legoland had opened, and with our son being a lego nut it was a simple decision to go to Malaysia.We had access to a car and driver for our stay, so he helped with immigration at the border at Johor Bahru which was seamless.  It took 45 minutes from our hotel in Clark Quay til we were at Legoland.It is hot, very hot!!  I admire the tenacity of the Malaysians in building this attraction in the middle of nowhere (albeit 45 minutes from Singapore). Apparently the government are trying to create an Asian equivalent of Orlando. Legoland is already planning a water park and hotel.  Dress light, wear a brimmed hat, and carry lots of water.  There are NO water taps around to refill, and yes you can buy water but soft drink and ribena seemed to be more prevalent.  A breeze came in about 2pm which made life a lot more comfortable. Meanwhile my husband and I thought we had never experienced anywhere hotter (and I grew up in Queensland, Australia!).  We bought a Legoland battery operated fan/spray bottle which was very popular and extraordinarily useful!It was very quiet when we there so were able to go on most of the rides with minimal queues.  My kids absolutely loved everything. They particularly enjoyed the driving school and we paid the extra for them to get their own Legoland drivers license complete with photo and DOB. Cute souvenir.We went to the main cafeteria for lunch (as it was air-conditioned) and they had trouble keeping up with the crowds some types of food had run out. Some of the food in the non-airconditioned stalls around the place looked really yummy.A highlight was the 4D movie experience. Not only was it air-conditioned (bonus!), it was really fun and different.We spent the last hour looking at the amazing Lego models, very impressive.Overall we all had a great time, and are glad we choose Legoland over Universal Studios.  Universal Studios will still be cool when they are older, whereas Legoland pushed all the right buttons for this age group.",4.0
4786,Fun for young children,"Suitable for young children and ample playgrounds for toddlers alike. A lot of eateries with tasty foods and wide choices with sufficient seats. Big prayer rooms at both ends of theme parks. Quite professionally-managed; lets hope they keep it up. Overall, my kids and I enjoyed it very much and have still a lot of grounds to cover. Minus points - information on showtimes & workshops  are lacking. We were there 3x throughout October-December and cleanliness seemed to decline; lets hope they noticed and buck up. They need to install more fans EVERYWHERE",4.0
4787,worthwhile,"Is it hot? YES; Is it expensive? YES; Is it FUN? SURE IT IS!Just a word of advice: plan your trip well before heading to Legoland. We went on a non-school holiday period, mid-week and I think that was the key for a day full of enjoyment and fun (almost no waiting in lines). Great rides for a 5 year old. Look for information about the minimum height required for children to participate in the attractions. Take your raincoats and umbrellas as you may get very wet in some rides. If t rains, go and have something to eat or head for the indoor attractions. Look up on the Internet about vouchers and kids-go-free promos. Also, if you have a My Kad (for Malaysian nationals), don't be shy to ask for a discount if buying tickets at their counter (not sure if this discount is available for tickets purchased online). And last but not the least: please try to avoid comparing Legoland Malaysia with Universal Studios in Singapore. They are different in nature and in my humble opinion, Legoland is doing a great job considering they have been open for only few months. Will go again in the near future. Recommended for children older than 5.",4.0
4788,The hottest Legoland ever,"It's definitely the hottest, most humid, most crowded Legoland we've been so far. Basically Lego brought the same Legoland in Europe to Malaysia without any adjustment to fit Malaysian weather. While the queues can be long at times, there's not much fans to help with the cooling. Not much water squirting during rides or no Waterworks where kids can play with water. All the air-conditioned areas, such as Build+Test are full of crowds looking for a place to escape the heat, thereby using up the seats for kids to build their Lego cars. There were not many shaded areas for a sit down, and restaurants are crowded and many have outdoor seating. Those with toddlers and babies will find there's more hassle for a little bit of fun.  Having said all that, the stage show featuring Mo, Mel and the team is entertaining.The staff are friendly and the rides are kids-friendly and safe. It's a great day out for kids, and worth every penny.   The park closes just when the weather starts to become interesting, at 6pm or 8pm (depending on school seasons). They also close on Wednesday (yes, why?) so better check their calendar before planning a trip. Legoland should consider opening the park till late, have more indoor attractions and clean the toilet more often. Having people (guests and park-staff alike) baked to perfection for this is just too cruel.",4.0
4789,Great place for kids!,"We had a really good deal for this from using the ¬®Kids Go In Free¬®coupon from Yan Yan biscuits and a Toys R Us promo. For every paying adult, 1 kid go in free. It wasn¬¥t crowded and we were allowed to bring food and drinks in unlike Sunway Lagoon. The rides were kid friendly and unless your kid is a toddler, they can pretty much ride anything. The queue also weren¬¥t too long even though we went on a school holiday week. There¬¥s many restaurants in the park and also a mall opposite the park.",5.0
4790,Lego land,"I really enjoyed taking my 7 year old son to legoland. The place is well set up and well run. A few tips;Don't take under 5s. Legoland is really for slightly older kids. There are height restrictions on a number of the rides, and very little to do for under 5's.The cost of a one day pass for one adult and one child is 250RM.  Depending on your exchange rate, this is pretty good value. I was using NZD so exchange is approx 2.4.If you are staying for more than 1 day, you can consider breaking g up your visits into 3 hour chunks. If you are adverse to heat then this is advisable. There are 2 day and annual passes available. To get value from the annual pass you would need to visit three to four times.Be prepared for high prices for goods and services inside. Your pass is all inclusive, but photos, water etc cost. As an example, lim h for one adult and one child was 50RM. Two ice reams cost 10 RM. there is cheaper food on the mall outside but you can only exit the park ONCE and you require a stamp.Practical hint, bring a small backpack, per purchase your water, bring a poncho for water rides and if raining bring an um reliable because there is limited cover, and bring sun screen, you burn slowly but you burn, also wear a brimmed hat to reduce fatigue from the heat.There are few unique products to purchase and I found prices similar to NZ, but there are a few so keep your eyes peeled. There are staff to take photos of you and your family but use your own camera or else you will end up paying a minimum of 30RM fir the photo. One nice sov. is a photo put onto Lego bricks, take at each roller coaster(3) but be prepared to pay 150RM.If you don't have friends in JB, stay at a 5 star hotel and taxi straight to legoland, this is a cheaper option than staging in Singapore, it will cost approx 300RM p/n instead of 300sing dollars and soon there willbe a hotel next to Legoland, being built now.All in all a great day with family, enjoy!",5.0
4791,Great place for families with young children,"My children under 10 enjoyed Legoland immensely, especially the rides.  Many activities for whole families too.  Miniland with all the landmarks of SEA and Malaysia is world class & outstanding for adults and children alike, lots of photo opportunities.  We spent the whole day there, as it was school holiday time and place was crowded.  The Lego shop sells Lego merchandise not found elsewhere, but surprisingly prices were not discounted compared to outside.  Will be back again, when the trees are bigger to provide more shelter and more rides are open.",4.0

4793,Very fun for child under 10 IMO,"My son, almost 8, LOVED Legoland MY. We bought season passes and I have no regrets. It's a bit time consuming getting there from Singapore using public transport, but very doable and each part of the trip is short so does not feel like a long trip at any point. The website could give much better directions..... we taxi to J13 taxi stand // B30 bus stop at Jurong Point Mall & CW6 bus one stop (to checkpoint) and switch to JPO2 which goes straight to Legoland and same thing in reverse heading home. Leaving Orchard around 9 a.m., spending a comfortable 4 hrs (inc lunch) at LL gets us home by about 6. Crazy busy on short PH..... I have only gone on weekdays and will only do so in the future. Prices for Legos on site are good (better than SG)! Very nice park, friendly staff, no complaints.",5.0
4794,Nice park for adults and children,"Newly opened in 2012, still lack of big tree for greener view and shelter from heat.Mini Legoland is the best area. The 4D studio is also not to missed.They have various roller coaster if you're an adrenaline junkies.",4.0
4795,Not worth the annual pass,"For lego lovers, its very interesting to see the miniature buildings and characters made of lego. But its not clear if its entirely made of lego or just the outer coverage. It will be much more interesting if they give some info on how many pieces of lego and how much time needed to build it.The queue is extremely long, the rides are not fantastic. Need to queue for 30-45mins for 3-5mins ride just not worth the time. The entrance fee is pricey for the amount of rides. Try once 1st before getting annual pass as you might regret it. For me, i'd rather buy annual pass for universal studio Singapore as the amount is almost equal. The food are exy for the country. It cost RM19 for a plate of spaghetti and RM7 for a cup of local black coffee. The souvenir are extremely exy. 3 pcs of fridge magnet is cost RM49.90!! Lego prices are a bit lower, but its still cheaper to get it in Singapore during sale.There was not enough shelter on rainy day and many rides will be closed, so better plan to visit on sunny day, weekday, outside school holiday season.The only thing i like is the 4D movie which really have the 4D effect. The lego pieces are seems flying out from the screen.Even though the queue system is very chaotic, its worth to watch.",3.0
4796,Poor excuse for a theme park,"It really seems like someone forced them into Malaysia. Why? There's a long list but they only allow 100 characters, so here it is - staff can't speak properly, place has no shade from heat or rain, everything expensive, food is crappy, merchandise no different from the ones you get in KL. Worthy of another trip? You'd have to pay me to go. ",2.0
4797,Not as bad as they say it is!! 8/10 for family with kids > 7 y.o.,"Have to say, I was quite put off visiting by the reviews I read here on TripAdvisor. So, I've got to say from the outset, that I really was NOT expecting a great deal from the visit.When I got there, I was pleasantly surprised. I visited on a school day (2/1/2013) and because of some of the reviews about long queues, I went at 0900 to buy tickets. I needn't have. I got tickets in 5 minutes. The park officially opens from 10 am - 8 pm each day. I would avoid weekends and school holidays if I were you. I can imagine it being a nightmare for all but the hardcore fans.If you know exactly when you are going, you can bypass the long queues by buying your tickets online. You do save 20% on adult and children prices, but have to book at least 1 week ahead. There are no family passes (currently). Currently there is a promotion until March 2013, whereby 1 full fee paying adult gets a child in for free (11 y.o. or younger). I got my coupon from buying something at Toys r Us (in Malaysia, of course). Saves you RM 110. The coupon cannot be redeemed online.As it was, it turned out that the park was pretty empty. There was a maximum 15 minute wait for some rides. For most, we could get on almost immediately. My family went on the Dragon ride 9 times each (the last 4 times was continuous ie. we didn't get off the ride!!!).The best rides IMHO is the Project X and the Dragon (not Dragon's Apprentice Ride) Rides. If you get there early, go for these rides first, because according to staff, they are very popular. To give a comparison, the rides at Dreamworld, Seaworld and Movieworld (Australia) are much better (but bear in mind that it is aimed at a different age group).You will get wet on Aquaracers, and very wet on the Dino Island ride. Because of the weather, you'll probably be sweaty and wet already!!! There are full body ""dryers"" which cost extra, but you will dry off eventually anyhow.I would certainly advise you to bring an umbrella to protect yourself from the elements. It was overcast when we went, so it wasn't too bad, but if the sun is out, you will dehydrate, curl up and die (if you don't mind dying, then it will be a pretty quick death!!). There is a lack of shade and it takes quite a few minutes to walk around from section to section. There is no shade in Miniland. I advise you to also wear shoes or flip-flops (thongs, if you're Aussie) with GOOD grip. Tiles are used extensively in Asia (for some unknown reason) and given the wet weather, are EXTREMELY slippery. If you can be bothered, go to the Daiso 5 dollar shop and buy a small lightweight fold up stool so you can sit during the day. There is hardly any public seating there, and on a busy day, you will thank me for telling to do this!! The alternative is burning hot cement or tiled edges!!! If you are super security conscious, bring a lockable bag, with a lightweight lockable cable (see below).If you wish to buy specific popular keyrings or sets, then make sure you go to the shops when you enter, because some items sell out rather quickly. The superheroes keychains and some Star Wars stuff as well as the Ninjago Lloyd KX keychains are sometimes not in stock.The toilets weren't too bad (compared to normal Malaysian standards for public toilets). It is normal for them to have water on the floor and to smell pretty bad at times. I understand there are 3 different movies for the 4D movie experience at the Lego Studios in the Imagination world. My suggestion is to watch them during the hottest hours of the day (because it is cool and airconditioned inside the cinema). Also, it gives you a break. The movies rotate with each screening, so if it is quiet, you can get out and go back in straight away. If not, you have to calculate what time to come back. ie. in an hour's time to catch the next movie you haven't seen.You can go out and come in (as long as you have a stamp on your arm and the original ticket). Medina Mall adjoins Legoland and you can buy food for lunch for much much less than inside Legoland. The quality is tons better also. A 600 ml bottle of coke inside legoland was RM 5.00. Outside, it costs RM 2.50. KFC is just outside the main entrance if you want ""western"" food, but I would suggest the chicken rice place further up on the left, or Old Town Cafe (on the right at the opposite end of the mall).Officially, my understanding is that you are not allowed to bring food into Legoland, but the staff rarely do a thorough check. I don't think they'd object if you brought in extra water, but I reckon they'd probably force you to get rid of the burgers!!!On most rides, you are not allowed to carry bags, so when you get on them, you have to either surrender them to a publicly accessible, but visible shelf system, or just leave them with a friend. I suppose theft does happen, so I wouldn't be leaving 10,000 bucks or your engagement ring in your bag!! You will have to leave your expensive digital SLR on the shelf. They have a lot of roving photographers. The whole place is sponsored by Canon, who therefore supplied all the cameras and pictures. FYI, they supply Canon 7Ds with 18-205 f3.5 lenses. The photographers will take your photo and you can choose to have it either raw, or set on a choice of 4 backgrounds at the ""Brick Shop"" which is to the left of the main entrance (as you come through). So what? Well, for RM 150 (about US45), you can have a brick wall made with your photo on it and they have a special on with a free 8X10 picture of you of your choice! It's actually pretty cool. They print onto the surface of lego and it can serve as a reminder of your visit. You can only have these portraits done at an official Legoland, so it is quite unique. The place shuts at 8 pm at night, so pick up your brick wall by then. It does take at least half an hour to do it, so its best to try and order it before lunch. Anyhow, you should get a photo before then, while you're not hot and sweaty and in a bad mood from queuing!Speaking of pictures, some rides snap you in full flight half way down a scary section. Small photos are RM 30 (about US $8.50) and you can buy larger ones for RM 70 (which come with a bonus small one - image is the same for both). The cool thing is, that if you have more than yourself in the picture, you can just buy one, but go to the website, www.pictureair.com, type in your unique code, and download the actual image for free (provided you have bought an official photo) for printing elsewhere. Photos from the rides, must be collected before 6 pm or 6:30 pm (ie. not 8 pm for the brick wall).One other unique thing at Legoland is that you can actually build your own minifig and buy it if you want to. Go to the official Legoland website at www.legoland.com.my to check for height restrictions and age restrictions (adults are not allowed on some rides). If your kid is small, then it may not be a worthwhile experience for them, because they will not be able to go on a lot of rides.If you drive yourself there, park in the Medina Mall car park if you can. It is right next to Medina Mall and has security. Also, if you have to take stuff back throughout the day, it is an easy shaded walk through the mall (maybe 100-150 m?).If you like my first review at tripadvisor EVER, then hit like, vote for me as Prime Minister, send me 100 bucks, or better still, hug your mum!! Hope you manage to get to Legoland on a super quiet day like I did!!! Be blessed, and have an awesome 2013!! :)",4.0
4798,Great place for family outing..,"Great place for family with young children. The rides are not that extreme but good enough for some adventure. There are many restaurants in Legoland and ample spaces for you to eat. They also provide restaurant outside of Legoland that you can go  if you decide not to eat in Legoland itself. The Babycare centre was fabulous. They have baby cots, microwave, hot water, play area.. a place that is very convenient for traveller with babies. However, There are not many rides available for kids below 110cm. As my 4yr old daughter is not 110cm yet, she cant ride many of the rides. I'll definitely come again with my family.",4.0
4799,No Water Cooler in a Hot Park?,"It is strange that Legoland Malaysia is built in a hot hot tropical country and yet, not even a single water cooler could be found in the Park to ease your thirst when you are in needs for plenty of water for your body.The Kid Driving Licence range are also very poorly managed, you may have to queue up to 2 hrs but you only see the kids driving the cars every 30 min for 5 mins of drive. Why can't they have parallel briefing sessions to maximise the usage? Many parent stuck at this station for too long for many hours.The rides are simply too kiddies. The building structure is so sloppy as compared to Disneyland which is still far superior fun place on earth.",2.0

4803,"Legoland or Hello Kitty Land? Legoland, by a mile","In December 2012, my family visited both Legoland and Hello Kitty Land. The two theme parks are actually nearby each other (Hello Kitty Land is within Puteri Harbour Family Theme Park, which also houses The Little Big Club).Having visited both places, if someone were to ask me the question of between Legoland and Hello Kitty Land, which would be a better place to visit?Without any hesitation, my answer would be Legoland. There are simply more things to see and more rides to play at Legoland.This shouldn‚Äôt come as a surprise as Legoland is a much larger theme park than Hello Kitty Land.Besides, in case you become bored inside the theme park, there are at least some restaurants (like Burger King and Old Town Caf√©) and some non-theme park related shops (the last time I visited, there was a sports shop and a local produce shop) outside of Legoland.In contrast, there are no shopping malls close to Puteri Harbour Family Theme Park, and not even a 7-11 or a fast-food chain.This is not to say that there is no room for improvement in Legoland. I think they should add a couple more attractions (and I think that this is indeed in store, together with the hotel that is being built next to the park).",3.0

The park have numerous lego figures everywhere, small and big!!! Don't forget to bring umbrellas for occasional rains and for sun shading purposes. Put on sunblock on exposed body parts. Coming from singapore is easy since we hired a private van to get us there. Will have to pass through immigration but we did not alight from our hired private van. Kids are at comfort while on the van. Bring tissue for personal hygiene. Buy online to get early bird discount for tourists. For singaporeans they have promotional coupons from shell and other establishments..Come early and dont bring big bags since almost all rides does not peermit you to bring them on the rides. Otherwise have to spend money for lockers! Or better yet take turns so that will have someone to look after your things.",5.0
4808,Better than expected - looking forward to future phases,"We were quite wary of visiting Legoland due to the warnings from previous visitors. Many complained about the park being only half ready, too exposed & hot, food being too expensive, etc. But we went ahead anyway, and honestly did not have any regrets.We visited on a Friday morning during the final schoolbreak week. We had purchased our tickets beforehand & the admission queue was extremely quick & painless. The crowd inside the park was heavy but not unmanageably so. Perhaps our expectations were low, but the park was larger than we expected (told by Singaporean friends that it seemed slightly larger than Universal S in Sing), though most of the rides (~70%) are kid-friendly hence not adrenalin charged enough for x-sport seeking adults. Still, there's enough to keep you amused for about 6-8 hours.Queues were only ~15-30 mins long before noon, but after noon, it stretched to 45-60 mins for the more popular rides. Our queues didn't spill out from the designated shaded areas, so didn't experience any of the torturous bbqing that some previous reviewers complained about. In terms of complaints about undergrown trees & hot weather, just head there keeping in mind that you are after all still in tropical Malaysia, so the heat & sun is inevitable. Just go prepared & armed with caps & sunblock to prevent lobsterfication. Also, we were thankful for the sunny weather as rides are normally halted without possibility of refund in event of rain. Food & drinks were quite expensive as expected, so bring your own if you have time to prepare. Toilet facilities were sufficient & clean, no complaints. For families with kids, strollers are available for rent after the entrance - handy for carting kids & heavy bags around. Overall, we enjoyed our visit and will probably return when their wet park opens in the future!",4.0

I thought it's cheaper but it's not. It's actually more expensive that those in SG toy stores.I was surprised also because it's been only some months when it was opened and some of the things inside already spoilt: buttons, speakers, paints, lights, audio effects, etc. What are you guys doing to this place?

Book on a WEEKDAY not on a weekend / school holiday or you will end up with long lines and sore feet.  How can anyone endure lining up for 1-1/2 hours for one ride?  So please, go on a weekday.  Best to go there from Singapore but if you must travel from KL, endure the 4-hour bus trip from TBS (Bandar Tasik Selatan to JB Larkin.  If you must travel from KL, just go on a night trip and sleep on the bus.  Best rides for me are The Dragon at Lego Kingdom, Observation Tower at Imagination Area, Dino Island at Land of Adventure, Legoland Express Train to see the entire place, and Project X at Lego Technic.  When traveling with kids, go to Lego City and try out the driving school and rescue academy. Legoland is mostly for kids.  The 4D show is just okay‚ÄîI slept towards the end.  The Loudest Show stunt show is boring.   Miniland and the Big Shop will probably appeal to adults.  Adults looking for a particular lego set will go home disappointed because most are out-of-stock, especially the Avengers sets.  The Legoland hotel gets done in 2014 but there are a lot of hotels in Johor Bahru.  Tune Hotel, for example, is the one nearest Legoland and offers transfers to/from the park.

4813,There's always room for improvements,"I've been to many world-class theme parks & I think there are still a lot need to be done. As a local, I would like to see the theme park progress & continue to do so in many years to come. What I meant was, in terms of facilities, rides as well as other attractions. Since we cannot control the weather, they need to erect a huge shade with good ventilation for the convenience for visitors come rain or shine. Waiting for trees to grow up will take at least 10 years & by then people would be talking about other new theme parks in this region already. Bear in mind, Disneyland Shanghai will be opened by 2015.Current rides such as train & roller-coasters have very long waiting time. Therefore, always sensible if they put extra machine to cater for people instead of limiting the number of visitors of the day. They have come a long way only to be restricted entry at the entrance because they came at a wrong time. The existing rides also will be outdated in 3-4 years & they need to come out with something new. They have to form a strategic business relationship with hotels around JB to provide free shuttle service for hotel guests especially foreigners.",3.0

Lucky I prepared my son with slippers, raincoat and a water protection for the stroller beforehand. My husband and I bought raincoats there instead.  The rides were ok, many of them had height restrictions and had long line ups,I was disappointed with he cleanliness of the bathrooms when compared to Singapore and the shop did not have many exclusive items to buy as souvenirs. The mini land was worth seeing and my son also enjoyed the covered semi indoor park a well during the rain.",3.0
4815,Preparation pays off,"After reading negative reviews of Legoland both on their Facebook page and on this site, my husband and I decided to prepare extra for this trip. This is my advice:1. Book tickets online, if possible. Otherwise be prepared to wait in the first of many long lines. The cost for tickets is on their Web site.2. Get there early and plan to be there all day. Tickets start selling at 9 am and the park opens at 10 am. It gets very full at around 11 am/noon. We drove and parked in the parking lot that is near the mall. Driving from Singapore was relatively painless and there is plenty of signage to get you there once you enter Malaysia. The longest and most difficult part of the drive was sitting in traffic when going through immigration.  3. Go with the understanding that you will need tons of patience: for the crowds, for the long lines that exist for every ride, for the heat, for the pushy children and even pushier parents, for the toilets that stink...4. Take your own food/snacks and eat outside. The indoor eating establishments are so crowded and the food is only OK and, as everything in Legoland, expensive. 5. Pace yourself and your children. They don't need to go on ride after ride after ride (because that just means getting into line after line after line). There are places for children to run around and play and it is a good idea to find a bench, if possible, and take some time to rest.6. Take and make sure everyone drinks plenty of water.7. Wear high SPF sunscreen, hat and sunglasses. The sun can be brutal.8. Take a large umbrella. We took our golf umbrella and it really saved us from the sun and the sporadic rain showers that happen every day.9. Have extra clothes for everyone to change into after the day is done. Extra tissues or toilet paper is also a good idea to have on hand.The Legoland staff were always very courteous and helped us when we asked. I saw the trash cans constantly being changed throughout the day. There was always a staff member cleaning the toilets, although they still stank. There was always soap on hand but not enough toilet paper.Overall, our children LOVED their visit to Legoland and have already been asking us when they will get to go again. I would recommend this attraction to families with young children (10 and under).",4.0
4816,Very Disappointed!,"My family and I have been to many world-class amusement parks globally; sad to say this is definitely the worst one yet.  It was even worse for us, as my children have all been ""Lego maniacs"" since a very young age, and we probably have spent thousands on the kits over the years.  The target audience is in the very young - pre-teen range, and my kids are older, but since they are such Lego fans, they still strongly wanted to go.  We entered, therefore, with high hopes.  The park is quite close to Singapore (a blessing).  However, it's in an area being built, with construction all 'round.  You enter via the mall (very strange), and when you come walking in from the parking lot (which still is largely gravel), you don't even see the Legoland sign.  After walking through the mall, you queue for quite a while.  We went during a Friday holiday, so expected crowds.  However, we didn't expect to wait in the heat for an hour for the first ride.  Even the covered waits often are not air-conditioned or well ventilated, or have fans.  It's hot and sticky.  We got in two rides before heading off to lunch.

Even though the kids were clearly a bit let down, we all attempted to maintain a good attitude.  The lunch killed that!  We ate at Jungle Caf√©, which is a poor excuse for a fast-food burger joint.  The queue was probably 15 people or so, and we didn't expect too long a wait for such food.  After waiting in the sun for 15 minutes, we noticed about 3 customers had been served in that time.  Our total time for lunch turned out to be an hour!  And, we probably threw away half of the trash food.  The chicken burger was inedible, and the beef burgers were soy burgers, with that 'interesting' texture and no taste.  Fries were very poor, also.  I can say the bottled water was fine.  I don't know what the staff of about 8 were doing, but they were doing it very slowly. During the wait we got to see the water ride break down about 3 times.  Due to the wait, and the sketchy maintenance, the kids decided not to ride that one, although all of us had been looking forward to it.  We did the observation tower, which took about 40 minutes.  I was interested in the 4D theatre, but the queue was enormous, and there were no wait time estimates on that one.By this time, we all were about ready to leave, but my youngest REALLY wanted to ride the Technics roller coaster.  I went to the store with Grandma, while they queued for that.  It took them an hour+ during which time this ride also broke down at least once, and had to be halted (should have been 30 min or so).  Other things:-toilets very poor.  Soap dish broken off and lying on the floor.-no drinking water fountains, and no source for water except toilet taps.-even the kiosks ran out of bottled water at one point.-trash in the park.  Stepped in gum once, which only stuck slightly fortunately.-grass growing up around some areas, and the village.-sand bags (yes, sand bags) lying around near the Observation Tower.All staff seem to be going through the motions.  There is little buzz or happy feeling in the park.  They don't seem to 'get it'.I will say the village models are well done and this is probably the best part of the park.  However, for the trouble and cost, it's simply not worth it.  Note we had a party of 7, and the total cost was near S$500.  I understand Legos have tighter tolerances than some mil-spec hardware.  Over all the years, and all the kits, we never have had a missing or broken piece.  It's surprising and very, very disappointing that the people who can do this put together such a poor example of a theme park.  Perhaps they should stick to models and kits.  However, if they really are going to try to compete globally in this area, they need to make some wholesale improvements.",1.0

The que to enter takes forever with counter staff taking their own sweet time to issue the tickets despite many counters being open. Once in the park after queuing for ages you will be presented with a park that is not well planned at all. Trees for shades were too small providing no cover and in the hot and humid Malaysian weather this amounts to a very uncomfortable experience. After an hour inside I was soak with sweat an almost died of heat stroke. Park attendants are disinterested in the job and bring no cheers to visitors. Not even a fake smile offered. Some were too busy chatting to each other and most were just like a statue standing and offering no assistance to any visitors. Perhaps there were hired as part of ornamental statues.

4822,Worst theme park experience by a million miles!!!,"I have been to numerous world renowned theme parks like universal studios, Disneyland, genting theme park. But legoland Malaysia definitely rank high up there in terms lousy service, readiness and cleaningness!!!!Service- when we reach the park at 1030am, we were greeted with an enormous long queue! After we got our tickets, another long queue to get into the park!!! All in all 40 mins wait to get in the park. All the staff has no sense of urgency, they are just taking their own sweet time without realizing that the queue has extend into the scorching hot sun.Readiness- the park is just simply not ready to be open to public!! In the backdrop is the construction site and constantly we can hear noise coming out from the site! The trees in the park are just not big enough to give the visitors the shade that they so badly needed, with that in mind there are also not enough fans being installed at the various rides waiting area, furthermore, those rides that have fans they are being turn on at the slowest speed!!!! Knowing that legoland is in Malaysia which is a tropical country, you cannot find a single water fountain or water cooler around the whole park!!!!!( they want us to die from heatstroke). Cleaniness- despite the fact that the park is only 3 months old, I can already see that some part of the park are already litter with rubbish like used park maps and mineral water bottle. Also the restaurant that we went to was chaotic and all the cleaning staff are just standing there waiting for the plates to be asked to clear rather pro-actively clearing them.Last but not least, the food in the park are lousy, my advise is exit out of the park get a stamp for re-entry and head the mall of medini for your meals, it's just a 2 in walk from the entrance and you can find so much more food there and more importantly much much cheaper.I just hope that management is reading this and much much improvement has to be made to make this park more enjoyable. Sad to say that, at this moment i will definitely not recommend this park to any of my friends or families",1.0
4823,Great concept but standard level needs improvements,"I went there with my 4-year old son as a day-trip on a weekday in December 2012 before the high season of school holiday, Christmas and New Year period.Having a Legoland Park within reach from Singapore is a good idea and a nice addition to Singapore's great attractions such as Sentosa, Zoo, Bird Park and etc. However, being an international attraction park, it seriously falls well below the international standard expected when compared to other types of attraction park such as Disneyland. I have not been to other Legoland Parks so cannot compare.GETTING THERE (FROM SINGAPORE:)Skip this if you are not Singapore-based. We took the most convenient (i.e. direct) bus from Singapore Flyer to Legoland. The bus is operated by WTS Travel (http://legoland.wtstravel.com.sg/index.html). Their service is average and they never answer their booking hotline number so it is best to book by internet. Make sure that you are at their Singapore Flyer office at 8am on the day of departure to exchange your booking confirmation to the bus tickets as there could be a very long queue. The 8:30am trip took between 1.5 and 2 hours. Note that this company also provides their own Legoland package so it is virtually impossible to book just the bus tickets in high season if you already have your Legoland ticket.There are also other less convenient (indirect) public buses where you need first to go to JB and then get the bus for Legoland from there.There is opportunity for more companies providing direct bus services from Singapore.The most time consuming part of the journey is actually the custom & immigration checkpoints in Singapore and JB as many road trips to Malaysia must go through these checkpoints. Singapore has very strict customs rules so the return leg of the trip would take longer if there are many travellers.We visited the park as a day-trip by catching the first bus (8:30) and leave in last afternoon.THE LOCATION:The Park is in the middle of nowhere just outside of JB. There were constructions going on around the Park when we went there.The Park opens at 10am only. Given that they close at 6pm (or 8pm in high season), I am not sure why they cannot open earlier to make the most of the cooler morning and also to spread out the crowd a bit.THE PARK:Contrary to what their web site says, the Park is **not** for all ages so the biggest problem I think with this Park is that although its target visitors are really kids up to 12 years old, they cannot seem to be able to manage their influx of visitors of older ages.Unlike Disneyland and other attraction parks that seem to cater for visitors of all ages, the attractions and facilities at this Park are very limited. Given the hot, humid and rainy climate, there are not many places with cool shelters. This situation is made worst when there is a 90-minute queue for the popular attractions.The food choices at the Park are limited, average and pricey as expected. Visitors are not ""allowed"" to bring in outside food.THE ATTRACTIONS:Given its target visitor population is below 12 years old, it offers a good range of attractions to keep the kids entertained for a day-out, especially if your kids are into Lego.The 4D movie shows were quite well made and entertaining, and offer a nice escape from the heat and humidity.The worst part is virtually all attractions had between a 30 to 90 minute waiting time after 2pm when we went there so it is best to get there as soon as the park opens and go to all your favourite attractions in the morning before the crowd arrives. This means that the park is likely to be overcrowded at weekends and public holidays. Note that they have been limiting the number of visitors during extremely busy days, especially if you plan to buy the ticket when you get there.I think they should think about limiting the number of adults per child in order to reduce the waiting time at attractions. I saw some families with only 1 or 2 children but there were 4 or 5 adults. This meant that these adults increased the waiting time for kids when they should really go and do something else. CONCLUSION:The park has great potentials but it needs to think more about the kids and less about attracting any visitors for profit.",3.0
4824,Worst Legoland experience!,"I have been to Germany Legoland, UK Legoland and this year we decided to give first Asia's Legoland a go, and the experience is horrific! First there were WTS mess which is same as msnakim's report, long line to redeem the tickets, we got there at 8:30am for 9:00am departure, and there is no way that they can clear the line by 9:00am with 2 counters. Finally got on the coach by 9:30am, an hour wait for just getting on the coach, then it was the immigration that took another 1 and quarter hour wait (this one on Singapore side) finally got to the Legoland at around 12 noon, a whooping 3 and a half hours to get to the park because of pure mis-management! Then there come real experience in Legoland Malaysia1. Absolutely unfriendly theme park staff - they have no intend to even communicate to you, we presented the tickets at the gate after the gruesome ""prison break"" like journey, there were three staffs standing at the check point (this is a proper term to describe the entrance) that kept chatting among themselves and did not even take their eyes off among each other! And I have been made very conscious of how the park staff interact with patrons, generally speaking, the staff behaved more like law enforcement officers rather than theme park's staff. The long queue is a given, however both Windsor and Gunzburg have staff that make you feel welcome. A smile, a simple kind gesture to the kids will help a long way, but for the whole day there was almost no act of friendliness from park staff except a slightly smile from a canteen cashier.2. Very dirty toilet - luckily this time both my kids are graduated from their toilet training, and the younger one can generally attend herself to toilet, however given the utmost disgusting state of the toilet, she actually intended to hold until the end of day, certainly that would be a life threatening attempt. Later on she was in tears when she really couldn't hold anymore and had to visit the 'living hell'! Imagine, we as parents spent the high expense for good intent and found out that actually inflicted such suffering to your kids. Parents unless you think you can bring your own toilet, don't even attempt Legoland Malaysia! I did not have that issue with both Windsor and Gunzburg, this one remind me a trip to some remote village in Nepal!3. Yet an undeveloped park- trees are too immature to provide any shade, half constructed building to form background to the park, only 6 months since its grand opening some facilities already show wear and tear, inefficient park staff on almost anything that requires their active participation  4. Wrong choice of location - either you are taking the route from Singapore (which took 6 hours return, we were told the day prior was even worse given that was the Christmas public holiday) or coming from KL (3 hours by road), I understand both Windsor and Gunzburg are not in major city or town, however this one is really taxing, don't believe the WTS suggested trip time of 1 and a half hour. On return, we took the 5:45 coach as suggested by the morning coach driver (he is friendly and provided a lot of good tips) that will beat the returning crowd and it did, however it is the Singaporean custom that took 1 hour to clear a 30 person queue. I don't know whether it is my bad luck or it is the Singaporean government making a statement to Legoland that their choice of park location suck! All in all, save your trip of going to Legoland Malaysia! After all, it is suppose to bring joyous and happy memory that we can look back to, however this Legoland is conspired to inflict a traumatic experience that kids will reflect on for the years to come!",1.0
4825,"Worth only 1 visit but leaves a lot to be desired. Good for kids under 10, but not for thrill seekers","We went to Legoland with our kids and my nephews. If one word was to describe the whole experience, I would say ""Average"". The park is built nicely and offers a peek into the capability of Lego toys. But if you are a thrill seeker, this is not the park for you. We went on a Friday but during the school holidays so it was extremely crowded. The Technic Rollercoaster had to be temporarily closed due to maintenance issues twice during my 1 hour 10 minutes in the queue. The staff there did not make announcements clearly. Infact the second time I was supposed to board but there was a technical issue. The guys there were trying their own version of how to communicate and when they realised it was not working tried to read out a prepared script. One of the staff members was curt as the gates kept opening and people thought that they could go in. He literally scolded a child. There is no concept of single riders queueing separately, hence a lot of time and seats are wasted. The flume ride was closed due to maintenance. Wonder what is the build quality that so early the rides have to be shut down or need frequent maintenance. The Miniland was simply amazing, most of the other rides stricty so so. Infact, in one of the rides, one child was going through between the two cabins after the ride got over and all the staff could do was shake their head rather than stop the child in advance and protect a potential accident. Frankly, we went there as it was a newest thing around Singapore, but would rather not go there again. Crowd management also leaves a lot to be desired and the whole atmosphere and set up does not give you the international classy feel. Toilets are sad.",3.0

4833,Public transport to legoland,"I would rate it 6/10 for overall. I think legoland is more suitable for small kids (7-12 yrs) because most of the games are for them. As for adults and teenager, is slightly boring because only a few rides are more exciting and thrilling. If you are thinking of taking public transport to legoland, you can take the public bus at JB Sentral, is about 45 minutes ride and cost RM 4 only. If you are keen on KSL, do check out my blog too.

4834,Enjoyable day but...,"Have heard horror stories of long ticket queues and parking nightmares from friends, so we decided to buy the one-day tour from WTS Travel (two-way coach transfer from Singapore Flyer and entrance tickets).We were told to assemble at Singapore Flyer at 8am for a 8.30am departure. The queue was long and by 8.30am, we were still in line to get our tickets. Interestingly, another booth was then set-up for the 9am departure. So while we had booked the 8.30am bus and had been queuing for 30min, the people who came later actually boarded the bus first! A lady behind me questioned the staff, and was firmly told that ""it's company procedures."" We got our tickets at 8.45am, and was told to board Coach L1. But there was no L1 in sight. Another staff said all coaches are the same, just board any available one. We tried to verify with the driver of L5 and was ""ticked off"" for asking repeated questions. Messy start....Customs took ages to clear (not anyone's fault) and we reached Legoland at 10.45am.Leaving Legoland was equally perplexing. You have to pass the tickets to WTS staff in a sheltered bay. Then listen intently for them to call your name. No queues, no loudspeakers and if, after waiting some time, you fear that you have been missed out and decide to ask a staff.... congratulations, you have just earned another scathing reply from a staff who looked flustered and tired.Enough about WTS....We were quite blessed weather-wise. It was a cloudy day with no rain! Just perfect, and we did not have to use the mini handheld fans we brought along.There were long queues at all the attractions. 60-120min (weekday).  So while the rides were fun, we thought we could find similar rides (minus the Lego theme) in Singapore without having to queue. My 6 year old enjoyed the roller coaster (Dragon's Apprentice), but found other rides lack-lustre when compared to Universal Studios Sentosa. My 3 year old did not meet the height requirement for most rides, but he was content with the playgrounds. In fact, he enjoyed the Legoland outing the most!We had chicken rice at Market (Lego City). It's extremely hard to find seats! The rest rooms didn't smell too good. The diaper changing table was littered with toilet paper (luckily I brought pull-ups)!Staff in Legoland are quite friendly.  I was particularly impressed with the staff at Forestmen's hideout. She helped those who were too little, reminded the kids to ""be careful"" and greeted mummies and daddies with a warm smile.Conclusion: Enjoyable day ... But it really is too much of a hassle getting there and back for average rides. ",3.0
4835,"Pleasant, enjoyable...","Went to Legoland Malaysia via WTS Travel's shuttle service from the Singapore Flyer on Christmas Day, 2012. Left at about 8:30 and arrived a little over 10am. I was pleasantly surprised that there weren't a lot of people then, giving my family and I a chance to enjoy the park and the rides without a crowd of people or long lines.The park itself is small, I'd say it would probably take less than an hour to walk the whole of it, if you didn't ride any of the attractions... The attractions are 95% for 4-12 year olds... and I'd recommend a visit to anybody traveling with kids of this age. Miniland, its centerpiece, offers Lego miniatures of different countries and is a great photo opportunity for both adults and kids alike. All in all, I enjoyed my day at the park, but I'd probably wait till the waterpark and hotel are open before I travel to Legoland Malaysia without kids again.",3.0
4836,So many ways it can be better,"Went on 26th Dec 2013 with my kids. The drive in from Singapore via the 2nd Link was easy and well marked out. The carpark was adequate although it looked a bit unfinished. It was comforting to see a Polis bus parked next to the car park and that was a good start. As reported in other reviews, long Qs for tickets and that generally was the theme of the day. Long Qs for every ride. The mall next to the park was a great idea and we had some food before braving the Qs in the park. The rides were fun for kids but there were also many which had height restrictions - a problem if your child is below 1m. Halfway through Q-ing for project X, we were told that it had to be closed as the cameras were not working. Bummer. The miniature display of world attractions was top class! They have trucks, cars and aeroplanes that move; ships that fire cannons; merlion that spits at you at the push of a button and even lego figures getting bitten by crabs. The miniature world becomes a magical display at night when the lights come on. Brilliant.  There are also many details in the park if you open your eyes and ears - would be fun if you still had the mood after being in the heat the whole day. The restaurants are ok and the pricing similar to those in theme parks. The park has NO water cooler. The shades are horribly far apart. The toilet is clean BUT wet and smelly. Be sure to bring your own ponchos for wet weather and hats for hot weather. The good old umbrella comes in very useful - i wonder why they don't have complimentary Legoland umbrella for guests to shelter themselves between attractions. The 4D shows, the indoor rides, the shops and the restaurants are great places to escape the heat. Oh - bring sunblock. Bring lots of water as well.Except for a staff (aka model citizen) i saw shouting at the kids lining up for the driving school (reminds me of a school discipline mistress), the rest of the staff at the park were polite and friendly - although they may not be helpful, at least they are somewhat cheerful (which cannot be taken for granted). So many ways that this can be a great and enjoyable park if the management pays attention to the feedback by guests (and read reviews such as those in this site) instead of talking among themselves (which was what i observed of the model citizens and their model supervisors). Some suggestions:- install misty fans around the park- provide water cooler all around the park- build more spaces for people to sit, relax and enjoy the park (while waiting for the kids)- provide complimentary legoland umbrella for guest to use in the park (given Malaysia's unpredictable weather where it can storm and shine on the same afternoon)- build more covered walkways and shelter (e.g. those at the playground)- have more piped in music- have more lego figures walk around the park (i only saw one for the whole day - and yes there was a Q to take photo with the lego figure)- extend opening to ten pm",3.0
4837,Fund for families with younger kids.,"We were there on a Friday because we wanted to avoid the weekend crowd. Even then there was at least 30 minutes qeue for each good ride. Wished they had a fast pass like Universal Studios or Disney. Anyway, the restaurant choices were good. Not much healthy items. But kids want fried items and sugar anyway right? People on diet, please pack your own food.The boys enjoyed the rides but I enjoyed the minature legoland the most. We did a fair amount of walking and sunblock and water would be useful. Overall, it is what you would expect from a themepark.",4.0
4838,A theme park kids enjoy,"This is one of the newer theme parks in Malaysia opened recently, and I understand this is the first Legoland in South East Asia.  We visited the theme park on a weekday, so I suspect that it was not as crowded compared to visiting it during the weekend. Tickets are a little pricy. If you are visiting with young children, you can get coupons for free entry for one child for every paying adult (currently available from Meiji's Yan Yan & Kellogg's cereal). Alternatively, you can buy the Legoland annual pass (unlimited visits for one year), and you should be able to break even if you make 2 or more visits. Parking was free when we visited but parking gantries were being installed so expect paid parking soon. The rides in Legoland are more suited for younger children, although the older ones will enjoy the rollercoaster rides. My kids loved Driving School and Boating School as well as Project X, The Dragon and Dragon's Apprentice rides. As we were visiting during a weekday, we did not wait very long for each ride.As it is opened recently, the park looks new and well-maintained,  although some of the Lego structures that were immersed in water were coated with algae, and this is expected given the punishing sun.  Let's hope the level of maintenance is kept up.  Being an open park in the tropics, do bring an umbrella or wear hats if you intend to avoid the sun as there are limited shelters. There are several eateries scattered around the park. We liked the pizza & Italian food more than the local food. There are children's portions in the restaurants as well. Outside the park, there are other eateries including Burger King and KFC, among others. We arrived at Legoland slightly after opening hours and left close to closing time, with 3 extremely happy kids.  This is a theme park that kids love.",4.0
4839,a good attraction if bringing young kids but not so much for adults looking for a thrill,"visited legoland on a weekday morning, and was pleasantly surprised that it was not as crowded i had expected it to be.in true asian fashion - there is a mall besides the attraction - good for folks who need a breather from the attraction or want to eat some food. (the food in legoland frankly isn't anything worth writing about) and a huge carpark besides. looking at the dropoff and walking distance from the main carpark (A?) to the legoland entrance itself, perhaps it might be better for folks driving to park in the carpark by the mall since it looks like you walk less. perhaps i came in with too much expectation - as i wanted to see how a lego theme park would look like and be different from others  - would the paths be lined with lego bricks? would all signages be in true lego fashion? will we see a giant lego / duplo playground where we were about the size of lego people? in all instances, my lego dreams seems to far surpass legoland reality. there are some homages to lego, but all quite superficial with some lego constructs here and there (and everywhere) in an otherwise typical amusement park. i personally felt that it didn't have a whole package to pull it together, and could had been so much better. (maybe they should have asked a lego fan to design the theme park instead of a theme park designer?)but this is seen from an adult fan's perspective - the young kids it appears, have no such misgivings and many happy faces are to be seen. with the exception of miniland, most of the attractions are catered to kids and some encourage dropping the adult at the door and the kid will come back after finishing driving / riding the horse, etc. I thought that was pretty empowering for the kid and probably good for the adult too since it gives them the opportunity to take a breather. There were a few family / group activities which looked fun - notably the fire academy where the team has to crank out some arm power to move the fire engine or police truck and then work together to put out the ""fire"". absolutely hilarious to see how family dynamics work. still, if you were expecting exciting rides catered to older kids, or being an adult fan of lego and want to go on rides using lego bricks etc, this probably won't be a good place for you. case in point, there is a water ride in lego jurassic park sort of fashion which goes in one simple loop - up a ""hill"" and down again for the splash. probably exciting for kids 7 and under, but nothing much if you're older. the same goes for the 4D theatre - watching the racer show, it was interesting enough but unfortunately it did not have as much ""4D"" as i would have liked it to be.the playgrounds are worth mentioning as there is a range of them and most are rather different from the conventional type. Very fun and you'll see many parents / adults being the ""moat monsters"" at the bottom of these play structures resting in the shade. Well, lack of shade does give rise to creative solutions i suppose! i also found miniland quite fascinating when you look closer and look at the details or see what the lego people are doing... quite amusing at times! i think the folks must have had a lot of fun putting it together.one thing that needs mentioning are the toilets - they are clean, but they have a strong ammonia smell and are rather unpleasant. that needs some work.",3.0
4840,New Theme Park but...,"Went there on a Saturday. The crowd was huge and the queue for rides are long, average queue was about an hour. The rides are not as exciting as USS and most of the rides are for kids. There's a drving school where kids can drive carts made from lego and earn a 'driving licence'. The interesting attraction is the miniatures of Places of Asia made totally from lego. Lego sourvenirs are available inside the theme park too.",4.0
4841,Something Different,"Legoland Malaysia is a new theme park in Johor. I visited the place on a weekday during school holidays. I took a bus from Singapore Flyer to Legoland which took approximately 2 hours without any traffic. I left at 8am and got to Legoland at 10am just in time for the park to open. As an Adult Fan Of Lego (AFOL) they isn't a lot of rides for adults. Approximately 80% of the rides are for kids. The miniature world model build out of Lego is interesting. It showcase all the major landmarks in Asia, from the Twin Towers to Great War. The miniature world is great for photography people. Lots of photos to take. The Big Shop and Brick Shop inside Legoland has a lot of Lego sets and individual bricks to purchase. Most of the sets are the hard to find ones or the big sets. Picking out the individual bricks was fun so you can create your own lego model. Lastly they is only one ATM inside Legoland, the shopping centre next to Legoland is quite new and no ATM or money exchanger. Lucky Legoland does accept Singapore Dollars. I highly recommended if you are Lego fan.",5.0

4843,Great fun with my 7 yr old daughter,"Went on 17 December 2012.  We bought our tickets online.  Thus, do not have to queue twice.  Quite a long queue to go in but was pretty fast (took us about 15 mins). We arrive early.  Around 10.10 am.    We enjoyed the park, side show and rides.  Mini land was great - very creative.  Of course we had to queue for the rides.  Sometimes can be tiring but was worth it.  We brought food with us - bread, pastries and thus we could have a snack when we are hungry and not have to queue at the eateries.  Bring along your sun hat and sun block.  It could rain, so you might want to bring your ponchos, or you could purchase at the park.  We came by taxi, cost us about RM 25 from town.  We took a bus back (to JB central)  as there were not may taxi around.  Cost RM 5 per adult.  Did not have to wait long for the bus, according to the bus driver, every 10 mins..

4845,Good family fun,"3 of us adults went for a day trip to Legoland from Singapore. None of us wanted to drive so we took a coach (details found on the legoland website - it's the one with the giant smiley face as its logo).The trip up was mildly exciting as none of us had chanced the Sin-M'sia 2nd causeway immigration before. We ended up missing the connecting bus from the SIN terminal to M'sia 2nd causeway (note: hop on any of the same logo-ed bus from the far right of the bus terminal [signposted to Johor Bahru]) and took a more circuitous route to Legoland. We bought our Legoland tickets online in advance - we saved 20% and also queuing time at the entrance. The park itself is well maintained. Like other reviewers have noted, it is very open to the elements. It rained very heavily that day and we got completely soaked even though we had umbrellas. Everyone there was trying to find shelter and with the minimal amount of sheltered areas, it was pretty packed.Regardless of the weather, I highly recommend bringing umbrellas, sunshades and raincoats (also useful for the water rides)!Food was ok - your standard theme park fare (western, fast food-y). On the whole, a bit pricey but they accept credit cards for those who don't have enough local currency. Now the attractions - this park is definitely catered to families with young children. I would think that kids between ages of 5 - 12 will find this most exciting. A few roller coaster rides (3, if I'm not wrong) with long queue times and interesting facades to keep the older ones (us) entertained. But overall it was not as intense as the rides one would find at Universal Studios, which is completely to be expected.The highlight has definitely got to be the Lego replicas of famous landmarks around the region. The level of detail is stunning and quite a lot of subtle humour found within. We spent over an hour looking at the sights. One last thing - there is a new mall just next to Legoland. One can walk over in 5 mins. They've got quite a few good stores and is worth a wander. There's also an Each-A-Cup(!). We only had 20 mins so only had a sprint into one sports shop and came out with quite a few items. Overall, I would recommend Legoland for an enjoyable day out!",4.0
4846,Expensive..............,"Visited the park in December during the school holidays. the park experience is average (mainly just because its new), but the tickets are exorbitantly priced. I do expect the theme parks to be priced at premium but taking into account the rides and other things, I think its too pricey.",3.0
4847,Disappointment,"We visited the theme park on a Monday, in a group of 4 adults and 4 children. On arrival after lunch, we queue for about 10 minutes to collect the tickets that were purchased online. There was a very long queue for people wanting to buy the annual passes (wonder why). It was quite a mess in the queue lines and there were just a couple of staff present to organise the queue and help in enquiries.Entering the park, every ride had a queue of 60-90 minutes as there were just too few units in operations. For 5 hours in the theme park, kudos to the kids who managed to get onto 2 rides all afternoon. You can hardly find shelters in the entire park other than the retail shops and restroom. There were also very few benches around for a moment of rest. It rained a bit when we were there and all the covered areas were crowded with people as there were just too few shelters. Fortunately or not, we brought 2 golf umbrellas with us and had to stay in the open because we were unable to find space in any of the sheltered area.On the amenities, restroom was dirty, wet and smelly. Merchandises range in the retail shops were somehow limited and pricey. We could easily find identical merchandises in Toy-R-Us at much competitive prices. If you had photographs taken by its photographers, it costed RM35-50 each placed in a paper folder. For photos printed on lego bricks, it costed approximately RM250. Ouch to anyone's wallet!!!Well, it was utterly a disappointment having so much hype of Legoland before its opening. After our visit, we would say that it was not worth a penny or effort.",2.0
4848,A wonderful theme park for adults and kids alike!,"I've heard about the reviews from friends and postings that Legoland is a place only for kids and they were all wrong!I visited Legoland with my family of 4 with 2 kids ages 5 & 7 last 18 December 2012 and I must say it was such great fun! We totally enjoyed the rides! They were simply amazing! We played all the rides. The roller coasters were pretty nerve wrecking but our kids found them thrilling! There were so much to adventure in this park.We spent the entire day there till close. It was really a wonderful experience! Aside from the long queues and the fact that we can't wear our ponchos up the rides (it was drizzling during some part of the day), we had a great time!",5.0
4849,Family getaway,"For me, Legoland is more suitable for family with small kids in comparison to universal studio as there are more things to explore for the kids at Legoland besides it is safer for them. I rode a couple of roller coasters at legoland and found my adrenaline level was still under control. Their 4D animation was not too bad, but still inferior to universal studio's rocking chairs.The things I enjoy at legoland were the miniature of south east asian countries made with lego bricks. However, the toilets were really frustrating. Really really dirty and I didn't see any cleaners around too. I hope they ll improve the toilet management with scheduled cleanings.",4.0
4850,A great fun day for the whole family,"It can get really crowded so be prepared to queue. Right from the time of arrival, long queues are formed everywhere so be patient. As a family outing, be sure to plan ahead all your food and beverages needs. The outlets within the park can run out of supplies thanks to their popularity. The time estimates posted at each rides are well done and rather accurate. Quite a large portion of time can be lost in the queue so plan and prioritise well what you want to do. There are not so many locations within the park providing shelter so get ready for sun and rain. For those worried about getting wet after the ride, don't worry as you can quickly and easily blow yourself dry on the spot!Just come early, stay late and have a fun day with the family.",5.0

Food selection is decent, and there are other options just right outside. Sunny weather almost all year round, bring your handheld fan and sunblock. Have fun!",4.0
4852,Avoid Going during School Holidays,"Legoland is very spread out and in dire need of more shady trees and shelters from the hot sun and rain. We went during the december school holidays so there were huge crowds consisting of eager locals and Singaporeans. There were very very long lines at the ticket counter and we were lucky to have annual passes so we can go straight to the entrance. Adviceable to buy your tickets online to beat the crowds.We went there over a two day period, not because we didnt cover most of the rides, but it was because of the huge crowds and the ridiculously long waiting times in the heat. On the Sunday  that we first went, we managed only four rides/attractions and the following Monday only three. Seriously, the management ought to impose a limit on the number of visitors to ensure most people will have a good time and opportunity to enjoy the rides and attractions. We are seasoned theme park visitors and know that there are always long queues at popular rides but the waiting environment is so uncomfortable. More cooling devices such as mist fans, air conditioners and water coolers should be installed considering that the weather is so hot. Hate to compare, but the nearest international theme park ie Universal Studios Singapore is so much more comfortable and pleasing. No complaints about the price of beverage and food, it is the normal standard for attractions. Cant expect it to be the same price as at supermarkets and mall food courts. They dont seem to conduct bag checks, so feel free to bring in your own food and drinks as long as it is not too obvious. Pricy souvenirs, which is also normal at theme parks.On a parting note, my tip to visitors would be :1. Avoid at all cost going during Malaysian/Singaporean school holidays even on the  weekdays2. Apply sunblock/screen liberally3. Drink lots of fluids4. Bring umbrellas, rain coats and portable fans5. Wear comfortable clothes and walking shoe6. Have your meals at the adjoining Mall of Medina if you dont like the price of food and drinks there.",3.0
4853,Expensive,It is a good attraction for children but expensive when going with a whole family. Not really worth it. ,3.0
4854,Fun!Fun!Fun!,"We arrived the park at 10 am on 18/12/2012 and it was already very crowded! Please buy your tickets online, much cheaper and you can avoid the queue. Needless to say, you have to queue at least 25 minutes average for each ride ( school holidays season). It was expectant so I was not really irritated. At the point of queing they have areas where lego blocks were available for small children to play so they will not be bored.Nice!There are 3 food outlets there. We bought burger combo at the Jungle Cafe (burger, fries and soft drink)@ RM22/set. Magnum ice cream @ RM7. If you don't wish to spend on food, you can bring your own. They still allow it. At the souvenir shops, sizes for T-shirts are limited. Priced at RM59.90 for adult and RM49.90 for children. Fridge magnet is so over priced @ RM29.90!We brought along our raincoats so the rain didn't stop us form the activities.Park closes at 8pm but the rides close at 7.30pm. Sign up for the Lego mindstorm workshops first before you go on the other activities. We missed it as it was full during that day.My children are 10 yrs and 4 yrs old. They enjoyed it so much especially my 10 yrs old son. We spent 10 hrs at the park and it seems like not enough!",5.0
4855,World class theme park with local attitudes,The theme park is comparable with others in the world. Those who complaint about the sun are usually Asian who do not know anything bout theme parks or prefer aircond shopping experience. The only thing to improve is better training for majority local staff. The management need to invest in people as they are also as important as the attraction. Maybe bring in some seniors from other joints in the world so local can learn from the pros on how to enjoy working in a theme park. Local always lack the customer service and professional attitude. The huge traffic made matter worst for them. Lost and sad faces. ,4.0
4856,Much room for improvement,"There is really no complaints whatsoever for the rides and activities within the theme park which my young boys really enjoyed like boating and driving schools, and rescue academy etc. and if they were older I am sure they would have enjoyed the rest of the rides for bigger children too..However, many negatives depicted by the reviews before mine are really true (which I don't really need to rehash all over again here!) and there really is much room for the management of the theme park to improve on, from crowd control to theme park enhancements (based on all the feedback given!!!) to give visitors a much more pleasant experience so that many would want to return again.",3.0
4857,Fun full day,"Yup it was hot & humid but u can only blame malaysian  weather for that. Come prepared with lots of water, sun block and umberellas. dont forget comfy attire and shoes. We couldnt buy tickets online since it was fully booked 1 week prior. ( panick) but we were able to get on the spot tickets which opens at 9am. The long queue was mainly due to the ones wanting to get in rather than the ticket lines. But the process didnt rake long. Queues were reasonable ranging from 5-20 mins. Good management. Friendly local staff. Very good and proffesional. A lot of rides had height ranges so the too little or too tall may not be able to go on all the rides. But there were a good selection of rides. I bought a 3 year old and a baby. There were plenty to keep my 3 yo company. The baby changing room- excellent!! I applaud the management for this. If possible to have one every park. My complaint to management would be dirty toilets and surau. Not good maintainence. Could be better. Great trip though.",4.0
4858,Average experience. Neutral about it.,"Expected long waiting time since it's school holidays. We were very fascinated with the lego pieces and how they could make the figurines out. If you do not have kids, one-third of the attractions are not for you. They are not stated on the map though, so go to Guest services and ask them to mark it out for you. If you have been to USS, don't expect thrill rides as the attractions are very mild compared to USS. However they are still enjoyable. We went on the 19/12/12 and their poncho's are sold out parkwide so go prepared with your own. Overall i still had an enjoyable time, but i wouldn't go again in the near future.Suggestion: the park is emptier after 7pm so i suggest taking ""Project X"", ""Observatory"", and ""Dragon's apprentice"" during this time to avoid the long waiting time.",3.0
4859,We had a Great Day ... But  Need Misty Fans and Water Coolers,"We were family with children aged 6 - 16 years old.We went to Legoland on Thursday 20 Dec 2012, a public holiday in Johor.  We arrived at 9.30 am, queued for tickets for 15 minutes, and entered the park at 10 am.  There were already huge crowd at the moment but most of them headed to the right or centre of Legoland, We went directly to the Mindstorm ride, to the left of the entrance, and queued for 5 minutes only.   Next, the Dragon Ride and there was no queue at all!!!  My kids jumped straight to the rides. No queue at the observation tower as well, the staff waited for us  before the ride.  Then we entered an air-con building where there were lots of lego blocks for the kids to play with.    We were the only family in the whole room at that time,  and my husband and I used the moment to have a nice rest.Next ride was the Dino Island.   The queue was still ok, around 10 minutes.  Then we enjoyed the miniature land.  We stopped for lunch at around 12 pm.  After lunch, we queued for the train ... and this was the longest queue ever, around 45 minutes.  This is a ride where the whole family can fit in, relax and enjoy the view.  Each train ride was 7 minutes long.  We stopped to pray around 1.30 pm, and went straight to Driving School (age 6 - 13 only).  The queue was long, but parents waited outside, at the driving range.  There were about 20 kids for each group  ride,  and my kids were on the 5th group, so they were around 100 kids before them at the queue.We were out at 4.30 pm.  But not before my kids took their second ride on the Mindstorm!!!My most favourite moment was the 4D adventure!!!  The movie was around 10 minutes long, and there were 300 seats in the theatre..  So even if the queue is a mile long, it would be a quick one.  I love the ice flakes!We covered almost all of Legoland except rides for little kids, so a one day pass is enough.  Recommendation: I hope Legoland install lots of misty fans   It is really a bless in  a hot humid and crowded place like Legoland Johor.  Water cooler  would be a huge improvement too.  Tips:drink a lot of water, bring them in.  A water bottle is RM2.50, soft drinks between RM5-6, ice cream around RM4.00.",4.0
4860,Hot and wet experience,"We visited Legoland during the Malaysian school holidays, so a crowd is expected. We got there before opening time and queued up to get in. When we got in, we were informed that the map of the park was already finished...and we were amongst the early visitors!  The rides, games were okay and as expected of a theme park. The kids particularly liked the Driving School where they could drive around on a track and earn themselves a Legoland driving license.The miniature buildings made of Lego were also amazing especially the vehicles that actually move around the buildings.The amenities were so-so. The toilets should really be cleaned more often as they were filthy.The place could also do with more shaded areas as it could get extremely hot in the sun or wet in a torrential rain. So do come prepared with sunblock, hats, raincoats & umbrellas as you may just need to use all these within a day! As for souvenirs, only buy if you really feel the need to buy something to remember the trip by...things are very expensive.",3.0
4861,Legoland,"We visited with my son, an 7-year-old.We spent the day at Legoland on Wednesday 19/12/12,  The drive from Melaka was about 2.30 hours.We arrived at the park around 11.15am and there were still lots of parking lots reasonable close to the park entrance. Throughout the day, we did not wait more than 10-30 mins for any of the rides which was fantastic!The rides were all age appropriate and fun for the entire family. Some popular ones for us were the Coastersaurus, Project X, the Flying School, the Nissan Driving School, boating, horse riding. The kids also liked being able to build their own lego building and race cars, test them out.The only setup back is restroom not well maintain, the door lock either damage or lost.Advise purchase entrance tickets via online or travel agents this will help you to beat the long queuing. Overall Legoland park in all a pleasant day for the our family.",4.0
4862,Awful,DisorganizedUnfinishedExpensiveDon't waste time or money. Stay in Singapore. They do things properly there. For example: the sign by the ride says 'waiting time 5 minutes'. Real wait time 1 hour.  Nobody is in charge of these things. ,1.0
4863,Poor Crowd Management,"Went to Legoland with my in-laws and children on 19th Dec, Wednesday. Recommend to bring sun block and lots of water as the heat can be unbearable. Umbrella is good for hot or wet weather. Mall is just outside Legoland and we came out to have more lunch options and to escape from the heat. Staff are friendly.The park is crowded as expected considering it is new and the visit was during school holidays. Ticketing queues were very long to begin with but fortunately we had bought our tickets in advance or else we have to spend longer time in the queue. Agree with other visitors that queue management is a big area for improvement. More staff could be deployed to help visitors to know where to queue as well as to prevent queue jumping, which is the common problem in the theme park which put people off. The staff are either oblivious to the queue jumping problem or not trained in this. More staff could be deployed at all stations, considering the big number of visitors everywhere. We saw people trying to beat the queues and taking as many rides as possible by getting in many queues and joining them after they have finished other rides, it is not fair to the people already in the queue, considering the long wait they already endured. People were also taking short cuts at the beginning of the queue by going under the rail to get in front of those following the zig zag flow. This problem alone is a deterrence to us making a return trip to Logoland. We have seen elsewhere where queues are better managed with more staff deployed to prevent queue cutting and to ensure all members in a group must be present before they can join the queue.The toilets in the theme park are difficult to locate as some have signs at one side only. Toilet signs could be displayed on all sides as we had to walk big round to find the toilet. The toilet symbols are not clear from far as well.",2.0
4864,Not worth going,"Not up to international standard. Need more shades and places for young or elderly to rest. Signage is poor. More like a park, not a theme park. Rides  are lack of safety features. Toilets not clean, paper not refilled at all time.",2.0
4865,Designed for European weather and income. Disappointed AFOL,"I went to Legoland with my parents and my younger brother on the 10th of December 2012. It was a Monday yet it was packed with people as it was the school holidays and a day before the Selangor state holiday on the 11th of December. So it came to no surprise that many people from the Klang Valley took advantage of the long weekend to visit the park.We arrived there at around 9.30pm and I can see that the area is not fully completed. The first impression of the large open air car park (3 o'clock at the roundabout) was a let down to say the least. In other theme parks I went to the car park is fully pre-mixed with proper lines, but the Legoland car park only the driveway is paved while the car park area is crusher run. Not a good start for an international theme park.I was expecting a long queue to buy the tickets since we wanted to use a discount coupon for 4 adult tickets, but the queue was beyond what I had imaged. The line stretched from the ticket counter all the way to Medini Mall right opposite the entrance. It took an hour to actually buy the tickets. It does not help that there is little to no shade or staff assigned to keep the queue in order where a simple rope chain with a proper shelter from the sun is enough. Also encountered a tourist agent which somehow trying to sell the tickets at full price to those in the queue. I never expected a scalper before, especially in Legoland! Inside the park is no different from the outside. Long lines, little shelter from the sun and even if there is shelter there is not much cooling fans nor mist sprayers to keep the heat down. I did not enjoy much as it was noon with clear sky and the sun above our heads. Even with an umbrella it is still very very hot. My first impression is that while the open design of the park is good for places like Billund or Windsor, it is absolutely terrible for a hot humid country like Malaysia. I have been to Everland in South Korea, Disneyland in Tokyo, Universal Studios in Osaka and while those parks are using an open concept the weather there is cooling and enjoyable. It became worst when it rained around 3pm. Due to the lack of shelter the Big Shop was filled to the brim and many areas were soaked due to water blown by the wind. As for rides, most of the rides are for kids and kids will definitely enjoy them. I think most of the other reviews from parents with kids can attest to that. However from an AFOL standpoint (Adult fan of Lego) I am disappointed with the prices as well as the selection of Lego to buy. It was touted that the Big Shop has the largest selection in South East Asia which is a statement I highly disagree. When I was there the Big Shop didn't had much Ninjago, Star wars, City, Friends and most importantly Technic. Not a single 2012 Technic set. Also the selection of key chains and souvenirs were below my expectation. Then there is the price of the items in the Big Shop. I was expecting the prices of the sets to be reasonable and not overpriced like the rest of country. But I was disappointed that the prices of stuff is no change from retail prices. At this rate there is practically no reason to go to Legoland to shop for sets. You would think after paying the high entry price there is some sort of discount on some stuff.      There is some good though. I loved the miniland models and how detailed they are. It makes me proud to see our national landmarks immortalized in Lego. I can look at it for hours had not it been so hot that I need to seek shelter and replenish my thirst. Also the pick a brick is a very big improvement from what I saw last time, so much so I bought more than a kg of bricks. Speaking about thirst, THERE IS NO WATER COOLER/DRINKING FOUNTAIN in the park, so better bring large water bottles as the drinks inside are expensive.  So in summary:-1) Very hot, open concept not suited for Malaysian weather2) Overpriced ticket price, overpriced F&B3) Pathetic Big Shop prices and selection4) Lots of rides kids will love5) Good but pricey pick a brick6) Met some friendly staff and managed to exchanged a few minifigures with them!7) Incomplete car park8) When it rained it pours. Will get wet due to lack of shelter. I heard they are increasing the annual pass prices which I think is a big mistake. The current state of the park does not warrant the price increase. I know I won't be visiting the park anytime soon.",2.0
4866,Fun trip from Singapore,"I went to Legoland on a coach trip from Singapore with 5 other adults.  The price was very good and cheaper than arranging transport and tickets in Legoland.  The park is so clean and new, it looks great.  There seemed a lot of adults compared to kids although the park is much more suitable for kids.  There are no great rides or roller coasters (Universal Studios is much better for adults) but despite this it was a fun day out.  The Lego buildings are excellent especially as it starts getting dark and there is plenty to do during one whole day.  There is also a new shopping outlet opposite the park which you can visit.  Food in the park was okay, it was very hard to find an inside table in the main restaurant but the food was good enough.  They also accept Singapore dollars in the park which is really handy.  One negative thing was that we saw a number of people trying to jump the queues and also saw two young boys trying to steal from someone's rucksack.  So be very careful in queues and when you leave your bag to the side during a ride, it is not as safe as Singapore! You cannot walk around with your bag open and mobile phone in full view! The log flume was closed on the day we visited which was a shame but generally it was a great day out and those with younger kids would probably enjoy it even more!",4.0
4867,Needs more shelters,"Did a self-drive trip to Legoland on our own using GPS. Went via Tuas checkpoint as it looks less complicated on Legoland website. However, our GPS was unable to detect some of the off-road. Fortunately, there were some big signs for you to follow, plus a few round-about.Would certainly appreciate if there are some mist fans installed at the ticketing booths. The queue can be quite unbearable under the heat.The staff are overall quite helpful and friendly. Kids who are 5-10years may enjoy more as alot of fun rides available. However, do bring along your hand-held fans and umbrella. Not much shelters were provided to shield you from the hot sun or rain Alot of trees planted are those that does not provide much shade.",3.0
4868,Fun for young children,"We brought our 5yo to Legoland Malaysia for a day trip. It took less than 20mins to reach after Tuas 2nd link and there were banners along the road as we drove which helps guide us without any GPS in our car. It was a warm and humid day despite the occasional rainy days in our tropics, so it would be good if the ceiling fans are not so high up as we could only feel occasional breeze while queuing up at the Boating School. The driving school is pretty much enjoyed by our child although it was quite a short ride. The rides are on average quite short hence we took two rounds for some rides eg royal joust. The mini land is great for picture taking. We went to mall of medini which is located right outside legoland to have our lunch as there are a wide variety of selection from fast food chain Burger King, KFC to Chicken Rice; Thai; japanese; western; malay food restaurants and more. We passed by this mall after we park the car at the carpark on route to legoland.There are not much variety though in the shops. The negative point is the toilet. It was kind of flooded when we went to the toilet near the locker rental area. We were disappointed that the Hello kitty town were not located right beside legoland although we saw the banners along the road on our way to legoland.",4.0

4871,This theme park is mainly for kids aged 13 and below.,"Visited Legoland on Monday (17th December) and was stunned to see the huge crowd at the ticket counter and the entrance. We didn't expect it to be that huge. Good thing we bought our tickets online. They didn't check our bags. Turns out that you could bring your own food and water.We were lucky enough to find friends at the front of the queue to enter the park and joined them there. The rides are mostly for the kids. The best thing was the miniland. It was awesome. It was really detailed. The staff could speak english, they were friendly and gave service with a smile. It rained in the afternoon. So bring an umbrella or poncho. The food was priced at an international price, so it's quite costly for Malaysians. The lego shop was big and also quite costly.",4.0
4872,Go only if you have kids,"Legoland Malaysia is only good for the lego structures, which were interesting and very beautiful. The rides were not that exciting, very much for children. The best one was the one with dragons. Food wise, there are many options of eateries, and prices are rather reasonable. Most staff can speak English and are friendly. Go only if you are interested in the Lego structures. Otherwise, thrill and entertainment wise, USS Singapore is a better bet. My friend and I caught the earlier coach back as there was nothing to do. I'd say, you'd spend about 4 hours there at maximum.",2.0
4873,Great day trip for the kids,"Visited Legoland on a Monday in December and was extremely surprise to see a huge crowd queuing for tickets for a weekday. Guess it was due to the school holidays. Luckily we bought our tickets online or we'll probably had to queue for a hour or two. Since they was a large crowd, we had to queue for 30 to 45 mins for each attraction and ride. Enjoyed the Wave racers and Dino island and do prepared to get wet on these rides. Do bring along a poncho if you don't wanna get wet. Didn't try the roller coaster as my son didn't want to go on it, but will try it when I visit the place again. Miniland and the 4D theater are great attractions too. As mentioned by other reviewers, two thirds of the rides are catered to kids below 12. The big shop does have a huge selection of Lego merchandise and is quite costly, but Lego stuffs aren't cheap to begin with in this part of Asia. Finally, it did rain late in the afternoon when we're there and we found the grouses valid with all the other reviewers stating that there are not enough shelters. Yes, there aren't enough and if they did built more, it would be an even better experience!",4.0
4874,Legoland-much needs to be done to be a world calss resort,"After visiting Universal studios Singapore, a place to visit before you die ,Legoland was okay, a place you can afford to miss.  One notable observation was a lack of landscaping which makes the heat or for the matter rain unbearable.I went during the school holidays and the crowd was manageable.  However Legoland does not follow the golden rule of basic courtesy where those wanting to enjoy rides must wait and follow  a queue.  This is a basic decency that we expect from people, who ever they may be, VIPS or otherwiseOn 12/12/12 when I took my children to Legoland, a group of children so called ""VIPS"" were accorded  special proviledges of a right of preference of not waiting in a queue, over paying guest like us.  It was very annoying that such an establishment condones such infringement of basic courtesies.Now they say, reading from the papers, that they are planning to limit guests into the theme park from 12-2 pm, to ease the traffic.  Such measures will not work if the general population come to realise that Legoland has no respect for paying guest like us.I will not come back to this place if such practices are allowed to continue. It is better go across the causeway to singapore and enjoy Universal Studios.Shame on you Legoland.",3.0
4875,Enjoyable day trip from Singapore,"Not withstanding the 90 minute delay passing through Singapore immigration, there was sufficent time to see the park. Depending on the rides chosen you may have long waits. The good thing is that each ride has an indication of the wait time. Before going to the park plan your rides and alternatives if there are delays.I enjoyed mini-land particulary. Suprisingly Christmas was being celebrated with gusto - Christmas Carols being played throughout the park via loudspeakers. I went on Friday 14th Dec and there was a rock & roll/hip hop band in the forecourt, inside near the entrance, thumping out the songs. People of all cultures were singing along - it was a happy enviroment.The only downside is the need for more shade/shelter around the park - especially inside the entrance. Elderly people & families with kids were searching for somewhere to sit before heading outside after the day.That said it was a nice day and I enjoyed myself",4.0
4876,Not prepared for the crowds,"Our plan was to go to the legoland during our Singapore vacation, using a rental car. We have been on the parking lot at 10:30 am. Today, December 17th is a working day, but there are school holidays in malaysia. When we arrived the queue was already 150m long, moving around 1m per minute. I went to check out the reason and found that they were selling tickets on four counters only. I calculated that it would take another 1 hour just to get a ticket.Then I saw a sign that said that they were expecting big crowds today and would likely not permit everyone to enter the park in order to keep it a pleasant experience for the ones already in. That was enough to pull the plug on the legoland. We drove back to Singapore and spent a great day in the zoo. Conclusion: stay away from legoland during school holidays and weekends",2.0
4877,Its a rip-off and badly organized atttraction,"Went to legoland on 10th Dec. Ticketing counter queue was a mile long and its without proper shelter.  The staffs are poorly trained. There should be more shelter at queuing area and proper marking (e.g. the 4D cinema). Shortest queue for any ride was 30min. For the ticket price, the rides were of poor quality. It's a sheer waste of time and money going there. For the price you pay, places like Genting Theme Park in KL and Universal Studio in Singapore offer better value and fun. This place reminds me of Mimaland.....  its a disappointment.",2.0
4878,"Dirty, unhelpful and a rip-off","Yeah yeah I know that sounds quite harsh but we did have a bad experience there. Sure the activities are fun for the kids but dont expect any kind of a 'can-do' attitude from the staff and dont expect anything to be clean or organised because it isnt.Also dont think that those 'kids go free' vouchers that you got from Toys R us or anywhere else are gonna work, they are very clever at making them not work. Even if you look at the small print you wont spot the catches. We turned up with everything in order, we didnt pre-book our adult tickets, we paid full price for the adult tickets, it was all in order but alas no. We were supposed to buy the tickets on the actual gate at Lego land instead of where we got our bus tickets in Singapore, who had told us that we had to get the tickets when we got our bus tickets and yes, of course the kids go free with vouchers.This is the kind of evil corporate exploitation that can make parents hate these places. My kids loved it but there is no way I am taking them there again, and I wont be recommending it to anyone else either.Play fair with your clients Legoland!",2.0
4879,Fun for the Family!,"LegoLand Malaysia is not only educational, it's also tons of fun! The replicas of Taj Mahal, Ankor Wat, Singapore Flyer, KLIA and many more renowned buildings from all over Asia were all made of Lego bricks. They were awesome! The lego planes were moving, the lego pirate ships were shooting cannon balls at each other; they were a sight to behold.The rides are also very good; one small roller coaster for little kids, and the Dragon for the big ones. The observation tower gives a 360-degree opportunity to take pictures from above the theme park. There are trains, cars, boats, horses for little kids to enjoy plus a 4D movie house.There are many food stalls and restaurants inside that sells chicken, burger, pizza, pasta, etc. at affordable prices.It is already awesome as it is but there are still improvements going on (they are building a hotel right before the entrance to the theme park).For MYR100 (25% if you book online 7 days in advance), it's a treat!And if you are a tourist like us, you can always book a hotel in Johor Bahru (cheaper compared to Singapore) and go to Singapore Zoo and the Night Safari the next day. They are almost the same distance from the Sing-Malaysia border. A shuttle service will cost you MYR300 per day. A little warning though: Go there on a weekday. The lines are long during weekends. It will take about 60-90 minutes of waiting in line just to enjoy the popular rides.  Being Malaysia, it is either hot or raining. So bring umbrella, cap and other weather-appropriate wardrobe.",4.0

Overall it was enjoyable. The only concern was the maintenance considering the park was still brand new. Toilets were dirty and wet, and flush not working. No toilet tissues. Wallpapers in the Junior Driving School queuing area were peeling like they were old.",3.0
4881,ONE WORD- DISAPPOINTED,"The main problem is the heat and the sun, you guys should build a cover on top of Lego Land, I was also not impressed by the standards of this theme park, one of the cashiers just said:""30ringgit!"", I mean come on, at least say some magic words or something.... If I were to go to Legoland again, I won't. I would rather to go to Universal Studios Singapore, despite the immigration and all that.",2.0
4882,Fun place for kids but sure needs improvement to be a world class theme park,"Spent 3 days at the park with wife & daughter. Access is good via NSE but signage leading you to the park needs to be better; perhaps start by having more LEGO icons incorporated into the various LLM road signs rather than using banners tied to lamp posts (for the last 10 km of the journey to the park) which don't give you much directions when driving at 110 km/h. Parking is ample, so no complains there.Before reaching the theme park, you get to explore the various eateries & shopping outlets of Medini Mall.How long should you spend in the park - with kids wanting to try each and every ride (and some rides being visited several times!), plan on spending at least 2 days during school holidays and other peak periods - the crowd from Malaysia & Singapore will ensure that wait times for the more popular rides are in access of 45 mins at the very least.What to bring along - Ponchos / rain coats, umbrellas, hats & sunblock; as the weather will be at extremes - blazing hot for most of the day and then rain bucketing down towards the last 3 hours that the park remains open (it helps that the park closes 2 hours later during school holidays).What I didn't like about the park - the toilets are horrendous; the stench hits you even before you enter the toilet area. In the male toilets, the auto detection at the urinals failed to work, so after you're done, there is no water to flush away. After only 3 months of operations, you would expect things like these to be working and for ample staff hired to be ensuring the place is clean and doesn't stink of pee. Certainly not world class standards .... need to take a leave out of HKDL and how they cope with visitors with poor hygiene sense.Food's expensive so plan on packing your own snacks. Staff - in general, they were very friendly but have to highlight some shortcomings - Boat School ride - for safety reasons they would stop the ride when the rains start but I don't understand why they need to push out the boats into the open areas then wait for the rain to stop before they would vacuum the boats to recommence the rides - this easily wastes about 15 to 20 mins and the queue gets longer and more impatient. It would have been better to park 5 to 6 boats under the launch area (which is covered or install some plastic sheet type curtains to prevent wind lashed rain from blowing in) and be ready to start once the rain stops whilst preparing more boats to get the queue moving faster. Park design - given Malaysia's tropical weather, there needs to be more indoor attractions for people to do something rather than twiddling their thumbs when it rains and all outdoor rides are halted - there's only so many times one can go watch a 4D show in Studio 4D or get on the Technics Twister.What I like about the park - Miniland - photographer's paradise - amazing detailed dioramas of world famous landmarks - KLIA, Taj Mahal & KL landscape were awesome. Kudos to the team that built them. Dragon roller coaster - Yee har - try it yourself and you will know what I mean. The live stage show on safety was really funny and young kids will enjoy this. Dino Island - wear your poncho if you don't want to be absolutely soaked by the end of the ride....although you can pay RM5 for a stint at the large dryers that the park has scattered near wet rides for you to get slightly dry.Will I visit again - yes, probably - since we have annual passes. 2013 sees the water theme park opening, not sure how that will work during the monsoon season?!?!",3.0
4883,Quite big and need hours to finish walking,dislike the scrotching sun and it burns my skin. Remember to take sunblock with you. The mechandise inside pricing is same as the brickshop. Remember to buy water and stock up before you go into legoland. You can dine first near outside entrance of legoland.,4.0
4884,Not worth the trip,"Went to legoland on the 7th of December by bus and I was not impressed by the lack of knowledge from the staffs when asked where the nearest money changer was. Not only that, it took ages just to reach the main entrance and most of the restaurants are placed outside of the park so I had to exit and re enter the park. Lego attractions are ok but for me an hour is enough to roam around the park. The problem is I had to wait for 2 1/2 hours for my bus to arrive and I was in a rush to leave. That shows how bored I am.The only positive that I can say is that the stuff that are being sold at the souvenir shop are nice but a little expensive. There is nothing much more that I can say but I am disappointed as I had high hopes before I came. I don't mean to be critical but something has to be done but I for one will not be making another trip. All of this is based on my own experience and other people's experiences may vary.",2.0

4886,A photographer delight.,"I went there with my wife, daughter and 2 of her friends. Drove there. Ample parking places. Enjoyed the boat ride and train ride with my wife.  Did not buy any lego toys. Just took a lot of photos. There are official photographer in the theme park if you did not bring your own camera. Tips- Bring umbrella or hat/cap (buy them from lego land souvenir sshop if you did not bring one ) , expect sun or rain as the most of the place is open- air display.",5.0
4887,Remember the sunscreen and umbrella,"The new LEGOLAND theme park is currently the main attraction in this region of Malaysia.  It opened in September 2012 so is pristine and spotless.  It's fabulous for young and old.  Be sure to allow plenty of time to explore the MINILAND feature.  It's fantastic.  But take an umbrella &/or hat as there is very little shelter and it rains often.  Take sunscreen and water too.  Food selection is extensive and reasonably priced.   Wear comfortable shoes.  It's flat ground but well spread out.Check if your hotel has a shuttle bus service to the park.  If so, book early to ensure seats.It is a fair distance out of Johor Bahru town, but public buses can take you there for just $4M.",5.0
4888,Very boring and waste time and money!,"I went there with my 2 children on weekend. I would say that this place is not for malaysianslah because it was fully occupied by some kiasu singaporians. Things like, cutting queues and book a place for their children by the maids are some common scenes in the game place. We waited almost one and a half hour just to get into the spinning tower but unfortunately did not get the chance due to some technical problem. The waiting place for each play station not fully covered, so when it rains the people got no place for shelter. Wasted our time actually! The restaurant esp. pizza mania food was lousy and very expensive. We had diarrea the next day. The photos for each game which was snapped during the ride was very expensive too. The souvenirs shop sells things but nobody buys anything because very expensive. Since it was raining on that day, many games was stopped, so we went to see the show at city stage performed by some foreigners. It was so boring and no fun at all. Overall we did not like this place and we hope Legoland will improve in future!",2.0
4889,Overall pleasent experience. Love it. But wait for water theme park soon!,"Buy ticket  online. It‚Äôs the best to start your journey to this place as no one love to stand in queue. But there are coupons like ‚Äúkids free for 1 full paying adult‚Äù means you still have to queue. I went to Legoland with my family: 10 adults & 4 kids. Counter staff will quote RM140 per pax. Ask for Malaysian price (if you are Malaysian). You can shed RM30 per pax. This place are not for eldery as it is as hot as desert. However the management is planting more trees for shade. Give them some time to grow. Wear comfortable shoe, Shades, SUNBLOCK, umbrella &/ or rain coat. Some plastic bag may be useful to keep your wallet dry if its raining. Its better to bring umbrella rather than the counterpart as it con cover you from raging sun.  drinking water at the time I went it is allowed. Stroller is provided for toddler & it costs RM 20 to rent. Wheelchair is FOC but RM50 deposit is required. Be prepared to enter the theme park as the queue to enter is quite long- depend on your luck. As soon you passed the gate there is an air conditioned restrooms on your left hand side. Walk straight and you will find an intersection: left to more adventurous ride, right for kiddo rides & straight for miniature world. If u brings children, take right turn & they will be happy. For my personal opinion the theme park meets my expectation. However it‚Äôs the best to go there later nx year as they are building a water theme park which expected to be completed in 2013 & Lego hotel (2014). Guess yearly pass is not a waste then.Do not so kan chiong to ride all the rides. Remember: Most of visitor will be exhausted by late afternoon. Best time to ride roller coasters are very early & very late. We skipped long queue by playing roller coaster at 6pm +. The park closes at 8.My suggestion for a day visit: Start early. Let the kids enjoy the ride first on the right hand turn. You will loss a lot of time queing for foe the rides. Have an early lunch like before 12 or later lunch to beat the crowd. For lunch exit the park & there are various restaurant i.e.: KFC, 1901, Old town, Burger king which is cheaper than inside meal. (you have to walk there ok). Replenish your bottles/ get new drinking water. After lunch hit the left turn or straight to 4-d movie theatre for relax in an air condition. It is at the farthest point in the park (Oh my English). Then start moving down. By 5 approx you may reach the miniature park for pic (but your face will be oily kaw kaw).  Just a suggestion then.Have fun!",4.0
4890,Bring your inner child out at Legoland,"Went there with family on 9th Dec, since it was school holiday and weekend, huge crowd was expected. It was raining in the morning and afternoon. Well, it is monsoon season in Malaysia at year end.      Our kids were having fun even the adults too. Most rides were for young kids. Do not expect much for adult. Do bring umbrella, rain coat sun block and plenty of water before entering Legoland.       We could not enjoy all the rides due to the rain. We definitely will visit Legoland again next year.",4.0
4891,Were they actually really ready to be opened to public?,"Visited on 8 December 2012 with family. I expected the place was going to be full because coming on Saturday. But never thought it was going to be overcrowded! All rides are at least 1,5 hours to queue. They should have quota per day so we can still feel worth paying 140RM. From all the rides they have, we can only get the train surrounding the parks (queueing for more than 1,5 hours) and remote control (using padi coin). My nephews gave up queuing for ‚Äòdriving school ride‚Äô after 1 hour queue and asked their father to proceed to the toy‚Äôs shop instead.I gave rating 2 (supposed to be zero) because I am impressed with the miniland. The replica of KL city, Singapore and other famous monuments in Asia made from Lego Bricks are awesome. IMHO,  they should make miniland bigger in the future so that they can catered most iconic monuments from ASEAN Countries and we feel worth paying if we can‚Äôt get into rides. The walk from the drop off bus/parking space to the main entrance is quite far in a very hot weather (can‚Äôt complain about the weather, besides the trees are still small), but at least build a better and more convenient pathwalk to the main entrance. Though, I still like the idea that we can rent stroller/prem for kids.The lego toy‚Äôs shop pricing is as much as expensive as in toy‚Äôs store in KL or SG. Well, they should make it cheaper or discount because we are all made it to legoland.Overall, it was one of the worst theme parks I have ever been in terms of convenience and access. Legoland Malaysia should learn from Universal Studio Singapore, Transstudio in Bandung, Indonesia or Dreamworld in Gold Coast, AU.",2.0
4892,A place for children,"Went there on a weekday, there was a huge crowd. It was really warm in there, game queues could be up to an hour. It is a great place to be with small children below 12 and family. The restaurant and food in the theme park itself is expensive and was not delicious. There are other games in the theme park which cost money too. Prepare for sunscreen & umbrellas, even portable small fans are recommended. The hotel will be built by 2014. I recommend to only go when its ready. There isn't games for teenagers that are looking for roller coaster rides.",3.0
4893,"Still very new, more for smaller kids","LEGOLAND in Malaysia has opened only in September 2012 and we visited a couple of months later. The first thing that strikes is the lack of shade. Being new, the trees are small and if it is a hot day, as was when we went, better keep on drinking water. It took 45 minutes in the line, too slow I feel. One of the reason may be that one can pay in Singapore $ and get any change in MR. Hence it also takes some time. Considering this, they need more counters. Once inside the park is just as well made as would be in any other country. But it is quite small. Some of the rides/attractions are strictly for smaller children. Even the 4D show was nothing much. Since we had visited Universal in Singapore, that was the benchmark and LEGOLAND was way back. But younger children will still enjoy. One of the problems with LEGOLAND is lack of stories like Universal would have. So they have to make up some stories with LEGO characters. The park is well made, no doubt about the quality and finishing. The 2 roller coaster rides, ""The Dragon"" and ""Project X"" were very good though. The whole family enjoyed and took it a couple of times. These rides reduced the disappointment to an extent. And the ""Miniland"" at the center, with LEGO models of different cities was completely worth the visit. The models were extremely well made, more of the parent country Malaysia. We spent a lot of time here. There is one model of the Angkor Wat temple of Cambodia which is extremely well made. Hence this made the visit worth it. We had got some promotions from food products in Singapore and kids tickets were free so it was worth the trip. Otherwise it would be almost as expensive as Universal, Singapore and definitely not worth the money.",4.0
4894,Either Too Hot or Too WET to have real FUN!,"My family and I visited the park last 9Dec2012.  It's a Sunday so the park is packed with people.  I have visited Legoland Billund a few years ago and my experience there was really amazing...  but I can't say the same for Legoland Malaysia.The BIG difference here is the WEATHER.  While the MINI Land is really outstanding, the scorging heat of the sun or the rain will KEEP anyone from really enjoying the amazing lego structures... which is too bad!  We just had to take a peek and take a quick shot and then run to look for shades - which by the way - almost non-existent throughout the park!The park rides and attractions are mostly for young kids and with that heat, it is really NOT healthy and safe to keep them under the sun for too long... some adult/seniors with health risks may even suffer heat stroke.  Seriously.  When we went there the sun is blocked by dark clouds, so it rained in the morning and again in the afternoon... it's wet but at least none of us suffered a heat stroke.  Even so, it was still very HOT... imagine what the park will be like during the SUMMER months?Please... Legoland Malaysia... you cannot pattern your park the same as what you have in cold countries... you need to put up more SHADES... more TREES... more of those big FANS blowing out water mist... and more drinking water stations (like those in Universal Studios)...And please... your toilet... I assume there's a purpose why a tissue holder was placed inside the cubicle... please load your tissue holder with toilet tissues! Travellers... please bring comfy shirts... umbrellas... ponchos... water... sunblock... large hats/cap... hand fan.... face towels (you'll be drenched, rain or not)... toilet tissues...The kids of course, enjoyed the park as the attractions are mostly for them... but when you ask adults if they are willing to come back there?  The answer would be a resounding NO.  Not until something is done by the management.",2.0
4895,Worth visiting,"Miniland was excellent, with a replica of the full KLIA terminal building (except the satellite building). The other rides are so so only, but they do have a big selection of Lego toys for sale, kids will love it, and also for those young at heart!!",4.0
4896,NOT YET INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS,"Drove from JB city. No signages to show to Legoland. Upon reaching only greeted by parking zone signs. No clear directions to park entrance. We parked at zone 3, that is at Medini mall. No sign at all to say that we can enter thru the mall. The toilets at this mall was in bad shape evennthough this is a new mall. Legoland staff's announcements were not clear. The 4D theatre experience was disappointing, as again annoucenements were not clear. There was no staff to ensure that patrons were seated at the far end first. We had a group who just sat in the middle and refused to move in. We had to squeeze thru. It was raining heavy in the afternoon, The mall and the park entrance was not connected by roof. Should have been connected for patrons convenience",2.0
4897,Good for families with young children with room for improvement,"We went on Sunday during the school holidays. There was a huge crowd, thus the queue to the rides were horrendously long, some up to 60 minutes. It was drizzling when we first arrived thus dampening the kids mood a little bit. For those planning to visit legoland, it will be good to come prepared with umbrellas, rain coats and caps or wide brim hats. The wheather can be unpredictable. It can get really hot, thus the umbrella and the hat can protect from the scorching sun. The rain coat is useful during the rainy season. They do sell rain poncho in legoland, but is is quite expensive as all the products sold there. Bring your own drinking water as you can get really thirsty with all the walking. Oh and do wear comfy shoes. The rides are mostly catered for children though they do have a few wild rides. Try the outdoor rides first in the morning when the sun is not so hot. My children love the driving school, however the boating school was closed due to the rain. The indoor activities can be done in the afternoon when the sun is hot. The miniland is such a wonderful area with the well known buildings in Malaysia and Sout East Asia thus not to be missed. The surau and toilets are cleaned and well maintained.Negative points - 1. food very expensive.2. No discounts for the lego sets. Price was equally as expensive as the sets sold outside.3. Minimal shades around the area",3.0
4898,Worth the trip for children and for them only.,"Went there on a Saturday and could see the park was overwhelmed by the crowd with bus loads of visitors coming in. For families with young children, this is an excellent place to be. The rides are designed for them and they absolutely loved it as can be seen from their laughter and smiles. Not often do you get rides that can accommodate their fun factor and Legoland clearly knows how it can be done. Most rides can be done for one child and one adult and there were many things for a young child to do. Young toddlers who are queuing or too young to ride can play with lego bricks with a play area at some of the queues. Some of the rides were interesting in concept like pulling yourself up in the air and letting your seat fall (in controlled speed, of course). Such rides would certainly make it memorable for children. For adults and grown up kids, this was a rather disappointing experience. The place was swarmed with people with queues ranging from 45 - 120 mins waiting time. Most rides were really for kids and perhaps some adults wanted to make full use of the tickets and decided to ride on them causing a longer waiting time. Some rides are designed for children that crew members had to highlight the weight limit to the waiting queue. The lack of ventilation (especially at The Dragon a rollar coaster) was aggrevated by the hot weather. The Dragon also broke down while people were queuing and despite the best efforts to get the people to leave, people were still queuing up as there was no updated information on whether the ride would restart or not. The miniature setups were nice though and good for photoshoots. Crew members were also around to take photos for you and with a professional camera that you can later view at the photoshop. A bizarre event took place while taking picture with the mascot. When it was our turn, the mascot simply just ran away and the two crew members left without saying anything, leaving us and the long queue of bewildered parents and children waiting under the sun. Crowd control clearly could be better. The fact that most adults were concentrating on winning soft toys at the game stalls (prices were on the high side) highlighted the lack of adrenaline rides within the park.All in all, this would be a good day for family with young children and perhaps a boisterous company of friends who just want to have fun and catch a tan. Outside food is not allowed but checks are not that stringent. Food sold is really expensive like RM 22 for a burger RM 10 for cup of soya bean. However there is a small food mall beside Legoland with fast food outlets and cafes which people can enjoy before entering. As the park is built with a water park and hotel in the coming years, it should be better for families. Adults who seek fear factor style rides should steer clear of this place and make it an enjoyable attraction for the little ones.",3.0
4899,Room for improvement,"About 10-15 mins from Tuas second link. Easy to find with signage along the way.I visited on a Friday and it's still very crowded. I would recommend to have your meals outside the theme park before going in. More choices to choose from compared to inside. Most of the attractions/rides are meant for young kids. If you are lucky, wait is about 15 mins else it will be at least 30-45mins for each wait which I think is pretty normal for most theme parks. It's scorching hot when I was there. Not many rest point to cool off from the heat. Do not miss the Miniland. You'll be surprise how they make those structures out from Lego bricks. Overall, a theme park meant for young children. What I would hope to see in the future is to have more eateries inside the park, more stalls that sell cold drinks and more rest point.",3.0
4900,Kids will like it,"My children had been pestering me to bring them to Legoland since opening, so we took leave on a weekday to bring them there last week (Wed)Transport to Legoland------------------------------ We took public bus CW3 from Jurong East to CIQ (S$4)- At CIQ, we took JPO2 to Legoland (Adults RM2, Child RM1).  There are timings for public bus, so if you missed the bus, the wait can be very long.  We took the 0830 bus. The next bus is at 1030, which Legoland is already opened.- Arrived Legoland at 0850, and place is void of anyone. =)- Ticketing opens at about 0910, and obviously there are hardly anyone in the queue.Rides we like------------------ Driving school, kids get to drive!- Lost Kingdom Adventures, we get to shoot mummies!- Beetle bounce for kids, but parents get to see kids screaming (haha)- Dino Island for getting slightly wet coming down from slope- The Dragon, a decent roller coaster.- Project X, after the Dragon, kids are wary of another roller coaster, so I went alone.Miniland - We left it till near the end for photography and admiring the buildings in the region.OK rides---------------- Legoland express, you just sit in a train and tour the park- Rescue academy, this is hardwork to pump the levers to move the 'truck' and fight 'fire'. - Boating school, drive the boat around a circuit. Queue was stated as 15 min, but ended up waiting more than 30 min. =(In the end, we took all the major rides, missing only a few. (benefit of going during a weekday).  Left the park around 7pm to catch the public bus back to CIQ.  Kids are very tired. =)What about food? We ate at Market Restaurant in Lego City.  Eating half chicken with plastic fork and knife is not easy.  Nothing fantastic.Anything to buy at the shops? You can get minifig keychains at RM19.95.  I bought a small Christmas train set that I didn't see back home.

4903,Great experience of Malaysian hospitality,"First visit to Legoland having heard rave reviews about it.  The drive from causeway was a brisk and smooth one (on a Friday) with multiple lanes highway almost from end to end.  Apart from the world class theme park and friendly staff, what impressed us most was the courtesy and grace extended by the local visitors (a unique experience compared to other parts of the world) There were orderly queues, friendly chats and no rowdiness.  These are marks of civic mindedness which Malaysians have excelled in.  Thank you for the wonderful experience, we will return soon...Some suggestions for improvement:1. Keep up the maintenance & cleanliness of the place (washrooms in 'castle' have a bit of stench);2. Staff to adopt Disney practice of every staff as cast members (local staff are still very reserved except for the ticketing staff);3. More food variety within the park (every cafe seems to have almost the same menu) though prices are reasonable;4. Reduce the prices of Lego sets and photo souvenirs, they are too expensive and demand is low I observe.Overall a well executed effort from concept, planning, building quality, operations,  technical expertise to customer service.  Malaysia boleh on this count!",5.0
4904,Legoland is not Universal Studios Singapore,"Spent a day here with my 2 kids. It was really fun. Most rides are designed for kids. Driving school, boat ride, train ride etc were all good for them. Staff was also pleasant. Unfortunately food was very expensive ~ RM22 per burger or hotdog meal. It started to rain at ~2pm and we had to take shelter in the Kings Castle. Otherwise, this was a great fun place. So is this place better than Universal Studios Singapore? It's not fair to compare both as USS has the Hollywood movie wow appeal which gives them an edge. Of course, USS is more glamorous. By itself Legoland is definitely worth a visit.",4.0
4905,Great Day Out!,"We spent a day out at Legoland Malaysia today (3 December 2012) and it was a day well-spent. We enjoyed all the rides, especially Project X and The Dragon. The 4D show was awesome. There are 3 shows running and each show was shown at a specific time slot. We watched 2 of the 3 shows - Clutch Power and Racers. We thoroughly enjoyed both shows. The Mini-land was good for photos. It amazing how everything is built out of lego bricks.

The 4-D Theatre was a huge letdown with seats that did not provide any motions. The Watch Tower went suddenly out of operation and guests in the queue were informed that it had to be maintained. Most rides were in good working condition (those that were operational). Food was nothing to shout about, just something to fill the stomach.Bring an umbrella on a hot day as there was little shelter in the theme park's open areas.",3.0

4911,Great day trip for a fun-filled day.,"Went with a group of friends and we each had a great day at the Lego Themepark. I would recommend if you are planning to do something different with your group of friends: a day trip out of Singapore at a themepark. The park had something for everyone. Though it is not surprising that most of the rides were for kids, my friends and I still found things to do and enjoyed the day. I most like the lego world display. Do bring along sunblock and an umbrella as sometimes the queues get so long you're standing in the sun! I recommend having lunch early as queues got ridiculously long at around 1pm and it got difficult to get a seat. It's also worth noting, no bag check at entry if you're planning to bring your own food in. Queues for rides on that weekend was long but waiting time was average considering that it is after all a themepark!Don't let the long queues be a put off though, if you work around it...you will be able to avoid it.",4.0
4912,"A little too sparse, a little too hot, otherwise still fun","Located at Nusajaya in Jb, the only mode of transport there is either by own cars, tour buses, rented vans or cabs. Overall, it's more to a kids heaven with alot of the rides and attractions specifically designed for kids. As an adult, my 4 fav attractions are the Technic twister, Dino island, lost kingdom adventure and the Dragon. However even the roller coasters are mild and gentle it won't trigger any heart attack definitely. The miniland is worth a visit as it is different from the rest of the Legoland parks miniland. The 4D and the stage show can be miss though. I find the whole theme park a little too sparse though with all the trees still at primitive stages thus the lack of shades. Bring plenty of water, sunscreen, shades and hats or umbrellas.I got the annual pass which imho is really worthy especially for local residents. Try going on a weekday instead of weekends as the place is bustling with people on weekends that most top rides required almost an hour queue. There is also a mall (medini mall) which is about 1 minute away for those who choose not to eat in the theme park itself so food are really conveniently available.I had blogged about the place so you guys can visit my blog for more details if interested.",4.0
4913,Fun at Legoland Malaysia,"I went with my grandson (5yrs), grand-daughter (6yrs), their mother & niece on 21 Nov, 2012. I bought tickets online & we arrived at 9.30am so there were less than 10 at site. It's really HOT. Maybe Legoland have to build a canopy over the park & have large fans to cool the place. Bec it was a weekday, we didn't have to queue that long, about 15-20mins. Of course, my grandchildren enjoyed very much. My grand-daughter & I went to Orlando last dec but it didn't make any difference to her. I was disappointed at Dino Land as they didn't allow us to ride bec my grand-children was not tall enough although their website indicated that children 4 years have to be accompanied by adults....we brought raincoats so that we wouldn't get so wet. :( We left about 3pm then it started to pour",3.0
4914,"Great theme park for families, pack well and you will have fun!","We visited the park today as a group of two families and a total of 14 people with a pair of twin toddlers. Everyone had fun. I agree with an earlier review that if you can, visit on a weekday. Given the length of the pre-built railings installed for each attraction, I can imagine how long the queues would have been on weekends. As it is the monsoon period, be smart and pack raincoats/umbrellas. Bring hats too for the sunny day, like the crazy weather we experienced today. There are sufficient seating facilities/ benches, toilets and eateries around the park; just wish the trees planted are a little more mature as they hardly provide any shade for now. If you have toddlers, bringing strollers is a wise choice as it is easy to push the strollers around and there are places to park them too. Otherwise you can rent them at the park entrance as well - but why spend that extra money? Save that to shop at the Lego shops where you can buy an assortment of spare bricks (per 100gm) and bases to add to your collection at home!As we had the 35% off vouchers, the tickets came of great value for the 8 hours we spent within the park. There are probably about 3 rides that are more exciting for adults and the rest are generally safe, friendly and fun for all generations. Miniland has great replicas of buildings around Asia and while the park looks vast, I like the way it's structured so there are greenery around and doesn't appear overwhelming with structures all around you. Lastly, enjoy the creativity within! It's almost possible to build and display anything with Lego bricks. Go early, take breaks and slow walks to enjoy the landscaping.",4.0
4915,Beware of credit card fraud !!!!!!!,"We purchased our tickets online thinking it was safe.HOW WRONG WE WERE! Today , almost a week after, my husband realized his credit card was used fraudulently 5 times ....all consecutively   !!!!! The individual amounts were not very large but they added up to over SGD2,000! We think it is from this purchase as he has not used this card for any online purchase for quite some time. Please be WARNED..do not buy tickets online!. When we visit Legoland tomorrow, I sincerely hope our tickets are valid.....cos I am prepared for the worst!!!What a bad impression this has given us of Legoland!!!!!!!!!",2.0
4916,It's the tropics. Why do you not have covered walkways??,"The rides was great for the family. Legoland is clearly built to international capex standards but I wish more thought had gone into simple amenities like covered walkways. The trees are mere saplings so there is little cover from the scorching sun. When it rains, everyone gets drenched. For a brand new place, I was surprised to find the roof of the cafe leaking. ",4.0
4917,"Heat &Rain Problems, with an Info to get there","I came to Legoland at monsoon time. When it was the afternoon, it was very bright sunheat with about 35 Celcius degrees in temperature. Me and my young boy actually played in bad situation for our health because of the direct heat that we could not avoid even when we looked for a chair to rest our legs. And when it was early evening, the day was rainning so hard with thunderstorms. Once again, we could not easily find a place with good cover to hide us from the heavy rain, unless we went inside to one of the restaurants.The park itself was a bit overpriced I think, due to the rides provided and the fact that many rides cant be used in raining day. Maybe the rides were not all ready yet (?). It was RM140/adult. But the 4D movie shows & Miniland were nice experiences. My young boy also loved the Kidzones & the driving school.For those who looked for a way to go to Legoland (from Singapore) and want to avoid the confusion with public transportation, I suggest them to buy WTS Travel's Legoland transfer. It costs S$20/pax, going & returning back route, included a RM5 meal voucher that you can use to get discount for any meal in Legoland. Just go to Singapore flyer, and there you'll find booth that sell those tickets (they also run the Hello Kitty town route). You can buy your tickets in advance for ensuring your trip time. Of course you still need stop at both immigrations, Singapore & Malaysia. There'll be such a long queue when it was a holiday or weekend, but normally we can reach Legoland in an hour.",3.0
4918,Best for kids,"I went there with my entire family and it was a real great day! Children had loads of fun but seriously!! only go if you have kids.. if you plan to go without kids, please find someone's child to bring along...However, be prepared to wet weathers and resting places would be seriously limited when it starts to rain. I would recommend leaving the park and go to the restaurants opposite the park and return after the rain stops.",5.0
4919,Nice for families with young kids. Go prepared for heat & rain. Happy Legoland is in Malaysia!,"You can see that this was a high-investment theme park as the stuff were impressive. I am happy they opened it in Malaysia! Worth it bringing my about-to-turn-3-yr old daughter. Bec she wasn't 3yrs old yet, she went in for free ;)Since we all know Malaysia is hot and rainy at times, we went prepared with sunscreen, umbrellas and hats plus my daughter's stroller. All the advance planning were put to good use. We arrived at 10am which is opening time -- lots of people already and super hot and sunny! True, they need more shelters and trees -- which I hope they will eventually do. Food was okay at the food court -- total of RM 90 for 3 adult meals plus 1 child meal set. Not too pricey for an amusement park. Plus they even allow you to bring in your own food/drinks which is very generous of them.Daughter enjoyed many rides though she is not yet 3! I would highly recommend for families who have young kids.Go early to avoid the possible afternoon rains. I guess during November time when I went there it was rainy season -- it usually rains in the afternoon in Kuala Lumpur so we expected the same for Johor. The rain started at 3pm and didn't stop until 7pm (which was too late bec when we saw the rain didn't let up by 5pm , we left already). The place is not perfect -- lots of things to improve on. Some of the staff's attitude and ""happiness"" delivery can be improved. You would expect a lot of happy staff ideally from amusement parks (like Universal/Disneyland). Food court can be improved in terms of the way the queue and payment is done.The attractions -- i have no issues. They all seem to be well built and well done...the only issue was the long queue at certain times. I super appreciate though that they had some lego area for young kids to play while the adults were lining up for the rides -- a way to keep little ones busy... so thoughtful of them.Definitely worth the fee and the trip. We went for a day (well almost a day, if only it didnt rain!). Ideally for first timers with young kids (and those who took long flights to get there), do opt for 2 days to really explore the whole area. We didn't get to finish it nor ride the super fun adult stuff since we prioritized all the kiddie friendly rides for my daughter.For more photos or if you want more info on my raves about Legloand (plus Hello Kitty town combo)  you can check out my blog, search for ""chinesepinkaddict""http://chinesepinkaddict.blogspot.com/2012/11/legoland-hello-kitty-town-in-malaysia.html",4.0
4920,Long queues in tropical heat and poor inefficient service.,"We have made the same mistake twice - visiting Legoland Malaysia.Our first mistake was going on the Eid holiday. The park was simply packed. The queues were very long - up to 90 minutes for some rides. The waits were bad, but it was made worse by the lack of time efficiency. Many of the rides spent more time idle during change overs than operating. They were often empty seats as well. The waiting was hot.The servicw was poor with water sold out at many of the stalls and restaurants. The food was fast food, but even low quality by junk standards. Again queuing was standard. We left disappointed and frustrated. The exception was our 4 year old son. We did complain, and we were assured that the crowds were exceptional for the Eid holiday.Our son did like the place, so we tried again last weekend, only to arrive and see that it was eben busier. Frustrating.The real shame is that there is a good variety of rides which both of our kids liked. Our 11year old daughter did not like the place because of the queues. If the park had a maximum number of people in the park, and worked on time management -  this could be a good day out.My advice is to avoid weekends and national holidays (in Singapore or Malaysia). It should be worth visiting during a weekday.Beware if it rains the park shuts down and there is no refund.",2.0
4921,Visit if and only if you have kids,"The place is amazing.... for kids. The rides are family themed and are mostly for kids. The rides are quite okay but again, for kids. The shelters are too small that when it rained during our visit there, the place was cramped with people trying to stay dry. The pizza restaurant, Pizza Mania,is just too small for the theme park. When we were there on a Saturday, alot of people were waiting for a vacant table just to eat. There's not enough table for the number of visitors in the park.The Miniland, however, is just awesome. They built these iconic structures from around the world and gave much justice to it. It almost feels like you're looking at the real thing. In my photos, you'd think the lego are real. The souvenir shops are a bit pricey but its okay. You can buy a number of lego items for the kids and adults. When visiting, take note that when you exit the park you can no longer reenter.",3.0

4923,"Good, typical fun","Went on a Sunday with a couple of friends - Be sure to arrive early as we had very short wait times for the popular rides in the morning.Two rides had technical difficulties, but in general the trip was very good with tons to see and do. If you plan your trip well and arrive when it opens you should be able to do everything by around 4 or 5 pm - We did some rides twice (again in the morning when there's only a short queue).Be sure to bring water and snacks - Things inside Legoland itself is as expected quite expensive, but there is a strip mall outside (you can enter and exit as many times as you like). Be sure to bring either an umbrella or quick-dry clothing as the weather this time of the year is very unpredictable.",4.0

4925,Theme park only for kids,"Pls be reminded that this theme park is just for kids, adults without kids will be very disappointed coz all rides are not exciting at all. Some only cater for kids only. Kids will have lots of fun if the heat factor is removed. This place is extremely hot, no shades or what so ever around the park. There is only a few indoors with air-cond which of coz will be crowded with ppl. Food and beverages are extremely expensive as well. I think they will make more money for food and drinks than the entrance ticket. Overall, this place is enjoyable for kids only and parents must be prepare to spend a fortune on ticket and food. Bring drinks if u can. Don;t listen to tour guide who mention we cannot bring more than 1L or drinks in. Those guides are probably paid to tell us such things as well.",2.0
4926,Fun but very hot and little shelters,"Lego land is actually very fun, if not for the poor layout where there are very minimal shade and shelters. This is disastrous if the weather is very hot or if it rains. There are metal benches in the middle of the grounds directly open to the elements. It's good to go once but pls bring a cap, umbrella and sunscreen. ",3.0
4927,Great themepark for those with young children,"My family got the annual pass for Legoland and we've been about 4times since it opened in September!The gooda) Parking is plentiful in open spaces which is preferred to dark underground parking paces. Don't forget a car lock though as another form of deterrence.b) Most of the rides have a 100cm height limit. 2 rides have a 110cm height limit. My kids adored the dragon roller coasters  (100cm), drive school, and most of the rides at the castle area. c) Lunch - the food at marketplace is not very tasty. Head to the pizza place near the 4D shows or head out to medini mall which is located at the entrance of legoland - much more food choices to!The bad:a) Toilets - are wet and smelly and dirty! such a shame for a legoland park to have such flithy toilets. they should just remove the hoses which seem to be the root cause of these wet and disgusting toilets! To the management if you're reading this - please consider removing the hoses and just provide toilet paper! It will probably help to keep your toilets in a much more desirable state.",4.0
4928,Trip to Legoland,"Overall it was good, especially for kids cause Legoland is a kiddo playland. However due to the tropical weather, it was raining heavily in the afternoon and most of us stucks in whatever building they have. But the Legoland Express is not doing a good job and let visitors waiting for more than 1 hour to operate, even after the rain stops. Most visitors were very frustrated.",4.0
4929,A wonderful place for kids and photos but not for thrill seekers,"I went there during my graduation trip with my friends and teachers. The first thing I felt was hot, hot, HOT. There is only a little small tree for shade. If you cannot stand tropical sun heat, I recommend you to wait for the trees to grow before going there. Next, this is absolutely not a place for those seeking thrill like me, just looking at the attractions I know this is definitely no a place of mine. So I wonders around the park and found the place I like the most, the mini land, where there are many miniature buildings made of LEGO. It is a brilliant place, some of things can move. This is a place I highly recommend for photographers. I really love it. Same as the other parks, foods and drinks in Legoland is very expensive. Bring tons of water if you are staying for a long time in there. Since the tickets are very pricey, I recommend to play to the fullest before going out. The staffs are very friendly, and moreover, the Legoland Hotel is opening in 2014. It is constructing when I went there. Looking forward to it!This is a park more suitable for kids, so if you are having a family trips your kids, I think this place is a good choice for you. Once more I remind you to bring sunblocks, umbrella and lots of water if you are going there. Look after your body, that is  the most important thing when you are on a trip!!! Hope you have a fine day at there...",3.0
4930,"Legoland, Malaysia","The postives first.  This is a great place for kids - lots of activities and rides.  The models of famous buildings in Asia are fascinating.  The 4D movie is cool. The staff were very helpful.  The Lego Academy was impressive. Now the negative.  The place is hot, since there aren't any shady trees to keep the temperature down.  The food in the restaurant we went, the Market, was cold and unappetizing, and expensive. The air conditioning duct on the ceiling was leaking and water was dripping on some of the dining tables!.  Buy the tickets online or you end up queuing for about an hour or more under sun at the ticket counter.  We bought the season pass and waited almost 45 minutes for our passes.  Also plan you trip and arrive early in the morning as it gets very hot in the afternoon, and walking under the scorching afternoon sun won't be fun.  Avoid public holidays as the queues can be long, not only for the tickets but also for the rides.  We went on a public holiday and we waited between 30-45 minutes for each of the rides and the 4D movie, and we tolerated the waiting time since it was a birthday treat for our child.  There were rides for which waiting the time was 90 mins or more which we didn't go.  The place can be improved particularly the restaurants and faster service at the ticket counters.  More fans and better ventilation at the waiting areas would be welcomed too.",3.0
4931,A pretty nice park but can be better.,"Travelled from Singapore to Legoland by public transport.Took a bus to Johor and then LG1 to Legoland. The journey isn't that tough if the traffic is light as in our case.Since we went on a Friday, the crowd in Legoland is still manageable. We do nto need to wait for more than 15mins for a ride.The park will be entertaining for the kids. The theme park enforce the height requirement strictly for each ride which is good for safety. So please do not bear a grudge against the staff as they have your kids safety as priority.Staff is very friendly and helpful. I am happy about it.Though the park has been open slightly more than 2 months. but you can already see the wear and tear in some of the displays. SOme of the display has their block removed by maybe vandals. Some are dirty with a layer of black dust.To be fair, it is a open air park so dust is expected to land on the display rather quickly. However, I do hope the park management will make an effort to keep the display as clean as possible.Malaysia as the ability to built beautiful infrastructure but maintaining them is always a challenge.When we were there, the technic roller coaster broke down and we saw visitors climbing down the stairs.As the park has little shade, it is really hot when the sun is out. Things to advice to bring to Legoland.1. Sun block.2. Umbrella3. Poncho. A poncho in Legoland sell for RM15. Doesn't make sense to me.4. Lots of plain water. We brought 4 liters of extra water in our bag and it is just enough to last us till around 1600hrs.5. Hat.6. Snacks. Food is really expensive there.There are restaurants like KFC and Burger King outside the park. Overall, a nice little park but going back to Singapore is a challenge as the traffic can be bad.",3.0
4932,Meant for VIP?,"We were there last friday on the 16th nov with my 2 small ones and waited for 1 hour for the water ride even though the signs stated waiting time is about 30 min. Apparently, one of the ride/machine were not in operation. To make matter worst, those paying guest about 50 of us at that time were ask to wait because there were some ""VIP"" who wants to ride and over took the whole queue!!! The lego land management were so rude as if we, the paying customers were invisible. Not an explanation nor an apology to us. She just shout to the operator of the ride that VIP coming. She only apologised when we all 50 of us complained. Should have been more professional. Overall, waste of time and money. Recommend pay a bit more and go universal instead. .",1.0
4933,"My kid loved it. As an adult, I hated it","Due to bad planning, we hit Legoland on the first day of the Malaysian school holidays. It appeared like the whole of Johor was there too. The sight of the thronging crowd at the ticketing counter and entrance was enough to make me want to turn tail and run. Nonetheless, we stood in line to buy tickets, and as the line inched forward ever so slowly, the muzak loop that was playing loudly on the speakers nearly drove me out of my mind. (Tip: Buy your tickets online!). The relative lack of shade at the ticketing counters coupled with the searing tropical sun only added to the pain. We finally got our tickets after more than 1.5 hours of queuing and then we proceeded to... join the queue to get into the park. Great fun, this. On stepping into the park, you have to squint to look ahead into the glaring landscape of concrete and tiles - no shade anywhere, you see.We hit Mini Asia first, which was quite fascinating, especially with its moving parts, but I really couldn't bear to stand there and examine the lego sculptures in detail in that kind of heat and glare.It is a pity Miniland was not sheltered; I can only imagine the state of the lego bricks after six months of being baked in this relentless tropical sun. On top of that, all the lego sculptures were placed at ground level, so if you really wanted to look at them closely, you had to squat down. In that heat? No way. So we cursorily speed-walked through the area. The rides in the park were okay, but mainly for kids. I myself rode on only one (very boring) lego train ride. Besides, the queues for some rides were heart-stoppingly long so we didn't manage to cover the entire park. Even though the park had extended its closing hours to 8pm that day, some of the rides were shut by 7.15pm even though I did not see any signs stating so. On top of long queues, the state of some of the queue areas makes you lose half of your will to carry on waiting. The queue area for the Junior Driving School, for example, was a bare concrete room that vaguely resembled a war bunker. The line for Rescue Academy snaked behind the attraction itself, so you couldn't even look at other people having fun while waiting. All you could see were bare concrete walls. It was depressing. And while there was shelter at the queue area, the heat and humidity made for a very hot and sticky wait indeed. The kiddy playgrounds were decent however, and my three-year-old son enjoyed himself running up and down the structures. And he also liked Lego Academy very much, and best of all, Lego Academy was air-conditioned. Ahh, the relief. We ate lunch at Pizza Mania, which served pizza and pasta that could possibly be the most unappetising food tasted by mankind and even then, there was a really long queue for pizza. I was prepared for bad food, having read some of the previous reviews, but whoa, nothing prepares you for this. Besides bad food, to my horror, I discovered that that eatery staff had forgotten to add water to the ice lemon tea syrup from the self-service drinks machine (so it looked like black coffee), but meanwhile, the Coke was so diluted it looked like green tea. Neither drink was drinkable and both cups had to be thrown away. To add insult to injury, this horrible meal (for a family of five) cost more than RM100.Toilets in the park were deplorable. The floors were always wet and cubicles did not have toilet paper. And then, at the end of the day, the toilets near the entrance carried such a horrible stench it was enough to stun a big animal. And oh, I couldn't find English signs anywhere. Even the signs in the toilets were not in English, which was a bit off-putting.   In spite of all these things, my kid was thrilled to bits by the park and went absolutely crazy running round and round, and going on the rides that he was old enough to ride (which were not that many actually.)He's been asking to go back but I do dread the thought of that, really.",3.0

Entry ticket quite expensive (as I'm comparing it to Universal Studio Singapore where they have more rides and more entertainments). The food & beverages also considered expensive.

Also bought the tickets from them on the day for SGD60 each they offered us this price as we were just going to get the tickets there.The coach trip including immigration clearance took about an hour and 20 minutes.When we arrived we realised that prebuying the tickets was a good idea as there was quite a big queue for tickets.The Park itself was very good although most of the rides were up to an hour wait. No express pass option like Universal Studios Singapore. There is a play area for small kids that our son loved.The food and drink outlets are very busy but reasonably priced.Our little guy managed to run into a lego shark statue and cut his head open. We took him to the first aid station and they cleaned him and his wound up right away in a very clean almost hospital like first aid station.we got the first WTS coach back as the rain had started and it took 2 hours to get back to the coach drop off due to traffic.

The ticket includes all attractions but the queue is too long as a lot of people was visiting Legoland (it opened just a month ago).Overall this is a good place if you have kids.",3.0
4939,A great place for kids and adults alike,"Kids or adults will surely love Legoland, IF you're a fan of Lego. I think for AFOL (adult fan of Lego), it is not so much about the ride, it is more about the detailed Lego models on display especially its centerpiece, the Miniland. Legoland also offers the opportunity to buy Lego elements at The Brick Shop. You can choose your own Lego loose parts and pay by weight. Some tips if you go with your small kids: (1) Please follow their wishes to play whichever game or ride they prefer most. And we adults, just ""play our part""! :) (2) Rotate your visit from an outdoor activity to an indoor one to cool yourself from the heat. We first went to play at the Rescue Academy, Lego City Airport and Beetle Bounce before stopping at the Adventurer's Depot for some toys and souvenirs. I love the fact that every Lego key-chain bought at the Adventurer's Depot is packed in a sealed Lego plastic bag. (3) It is best to go during the weekdays, and not during the school holidays! (4) Capture not only photos, but do take some videos especially on the interactive attractions like the Musical Fountain, your kids will love to watch it again. (5) If you plan to have your family photo taken by the official photographer, do it as soon as you arrive so that it is ready by the time you collect. Afterall, you will look more energetic with less sweat :P Again, for die hard fan of Lego like myself, I finally opted to have our family photo printed on the Lego bricks. (6) The food price may be on the high side, but it is actually worth your money and it's delicious too! (We had the chicken rice set at the Market Restaurant and western food at the Knight's Feast, both were really good). (7) Lastly, just bring the child in you, and you will definitely enjoy your visit! For our two visits, we used the Kids Go Free voucher from KFC and Dutch Lady milk carton. That is the best deal we can get for a family of four.",5.0
4940,"Been to one, been to all...","Arrived at about 10 a.m and entered the park with no queues or problems. Immediately proceeded to take my son to the driving school ""open road"". The queue was short but the ride was dissappointing. It lasted hardly 5 mins and the kids could hardly do 1 lap around the circuit. Next went to view the 4D movie which i must say was rather enjoyable. By this time it was already noon and it was ubrearably hot and the place was filling up. Proceeded to another ride which went through dark tunnels shooting at targets. I cant seem to recall the name of the attraction but it was exactly like the one i had gone to in Disneyland HK. Wanted to ride the roller coaster but the queue was too long with an estimated waiting time of 120 minutes. In fact most of the popolar rides had a waiting time of more than 60 minutes. Out of frustration, left the place at 2 pm. Overall, the attendants were not tOo friendly and seemed like they didnt enjoy their job at all. There was no PR at all and Legoland should possibly emphasize more on this, especially on the popular rides with long queue's. The heat was unbearable with very little shade to rest and hardly any trees. The food and drinks were expensive. My personal opinion is that once you been to one theme park, you've been to all.only the props are different, the rides and attraction are similar. The difference is you can visit other resorts in cooler seasons and that alone would make it pleasant. I'm not looking forward to going to Legoland Malaysia again.",2.0

4946,so much hype but no substance ... rather disappointed,"In a nutshell, if you're an adult who doesn't enjoy roller-coaster rides (like me) then you are left with no other options cos the rest are just kiddie rides...Unlike in other theme parks that i have been to eg Genting, Disneyland HK, Univ Studios Singapore , they offer a variety of rides that may cater to various ages and also various interest from the adrenaline junkies to the less adventurous adultsEntrance fee is probably among the most expensive if not the most expensive in Malaysia (which was why i had rather high expectations to begin with)Food prices within the park is really through the roof... Imagine burgers and hot dogs at RM15 each; 14"" pizza at RM45 each (very thin and nothing much as the topping) ...Hygiene and cleanliness is well maintained even in the bathrooms ( one good point there)The whole park being in sweltering tropical climate, surprisingly seems like somebody overlooked that fact and visitors were left in the open spaces with minimal shadings provided either from trees or adequate roofings.Park benches scattered ubiquitously in the open sun were being left unused most of the times due to the weather.Queue areas were humid, hot and there were no fans or very few and slowly running fans very very high up at the ceilings... Gosh! The mist-spraying fans would have been great and should be everywhere...Rain is another problem and visitors will be scampering for the limited shelters available",3.0
4947,Nice ride for young kids,"The park was huge and the rides were fun for younger kids.  My kids loves the King Jostle, Car driving, Kid's power tower (must try) and the many lego playing area for the kids during the q for the rides.   Loves the miniland.....it was just amazing what these guys could do with the lego blocks.  My kids were totally awe with the miniland.Food price cost around RM20/pax including drink.  Food quality were good.The only set-back was the huge crowd during the holiday season and hot weather.  ",4.0
4948,HOT HOT LEGOLAND,"Was there  on 16 Nov 2012. Queue almost 2 hours to redeem the FOC child tickets at the ticketing counter. Would advise all those without FOC tickets to buy ONLINE TICKETS. I bought 2 tickets online, however, need to queue to redeem the FOC CHILD ticket. There are so many children on stroller crying at entrance... while waiting for their tickets. It was only 11am... The weather was so so HOT!.  This could be avoidable if LEGOLAND MANAGEMENT install more shades and add COOLER FANS. I have to queue to buy tickets under the HOT HOT SUN. Luckily i brought an umbrella. LEGOLAND is suitable for age 10 and below only. Unlike UNIVERSAL STUDIO, Parents have to wait for their kids to finish their rides in HOT HOT SUN. My 7 and 12 yr old kids and myself was TOTALLY SUNBURNED and dyhydrated after one day outting at LEGOLAND. Although we went on Friday, to avoid the crowd, the queue was still slow as the rides capacity was very small.It was a very bad experience for me. Left LEGOLAND with headache due to the heat.The management should seriously look into adding more shades and aircond waiting areas.It is a themepark meant for children below 10.. and there are so many children on strollers crying everywhere.... We had pizza lunch.. which was lousy.. and 2 hours later bought the burger which was O.K. but had to eat it under HOT HOT sun... I cannot imagine what it would be like if it rains!!!....",2.0

4950,Not a very efficient ticketing counters,"This was my 2nd time to Legoland. But this time around the number of visitors jumped drastically since it was the school holidays in Msia and Spore. As I was queuing to purchase an annual pass for my eldest son (the rest of the family have one each from our earlier visit), I cannot help but notice there were only 2 counters open for a queue of about 50 people.I seriously think the management need to beef up the efficiency aspect to provide a better customer experience beginning at the ticket booths.It was unusually hot. The heat might have not been too bad If there was more shaded area or vegetation. This is an outdoor park so you are left to the mercy of the elements!The queues to all the rides were unusually long. There was NO option of an Express lane like in Universal Studios .Most of the rides were meant for children rather that for adults. There are no street performers which most of us are use to in other theme parks eg. Disney and US.I guess the plus point is the minimal cost of the annual pass ie. RM 275.My kids went again for another 2 subsequent days at no extra cost.",3.0

4952,Need to have more vegetation to provide shade/shelter from the tropical heat!,"Overall, good attempt to revive the Johor economy but the Legoland staff need a lot more training in terms of interacting with guests to provide ""the"" theme park experience like Disney/Universal Studio (the one in Spore excluded as the staff there needs more training too!).Another major comment is that the park (!!) needs more mature vegetation to provide the shade desperately needed in this tropical climate. With the young shoots planted, it will probably take another decade before the trees can provide any decent shade. Currently, it is more of a concrete jungle.",3.0
4953,I love Lego!!,"Legoland is a family theme park dedicated to all aged group and most of all Lego‚Äôs fan, featuring 7 themed areas with more than 40 interactive rides, show and attractions.  Would like to share my one day itinerary (10am -8pm) in Legoland with a blessed weather: Lego City ‚Äì First stop, priority for my son at the Driving school, kids will be brief on safety driving before they‚Äôre allow to hand on the Lego‚Äôs  car. Once they finish the driving, they will be rewarded with a Driving License with your photos on the license (charges applied). Then, the whole family went for the Rescue Academy, team work play roll required. Lego Technic ‚Äì for the thrilling ride, go for Project X (more to adult‚Äôs interest) and calm down with AquaZone wave racers. Miniland ‚Äì found this place good for snapping photos, with 30 million of Lego bricks to recreate Asia‚Äôs best known landmarks. (Better visit this place before noon)Time for lunch ‚Äì try out the cafes and restaurants. It sure expensive but one can choose the combo or kid‚Äôs meal. Jungle Caf√© served nice kid meal ‚Äì hotdog, fries and Ribena.  Land of Adventure ‚Äì the weather is getting hot, so time to go for more indoor games. Lost Kingdom, fire laser blaster rides at the pharaoh temple. Dino island, look out for the Lego dinosaurs on a wet and wild ride. A portable blow drier room is nearby this ride (charges applied). Imagination ‚Äì Built & Test is the place for the Lego‚Äôs fan. A fascinating 20minutes movie at Studios 4D, with one hour long queuing and without proper shade. Kids Power Tower, prove your strength to gain a better view of the park. You may also take the Observation Tower to have an overall bird view of Legoland. (Should have more green landscaping, the view look more like a mining land) Lego Kingdom ‚Äì indoor queuing, by the time step into the Dragon Coaster is already evening. Nice twists and turns ride. Settle down with a gallop on the Royal Joust, my son love this slow galloping Lego horse. The Beginning ‚Äì The money pouring begin, my son really love the air-conditioning shopping. Varieties and colorful bricks, from mini figure to toys, T-shirt to bags and so on. The most happening is Ninjago. Had a wonderful day in Legoland but there is room for improvement -1. Should plant more adults trees, put up more cover shade or shelter. Suggest building trees with Lego bricks because the young trees inside Legoland take a long time to grow.2. Put more mist fans and fountain around the park to lower the afternoon heat.3. For the ride, don‚Äôt empty the next seat. Many times, staff arrange single visitor for a two seated ride. Eg. Staff can ask another single visitor to occupy the next empty seat, maybe it will speed up the Q line and the ride will not look so empty. 4. Along the zig zag Q line, maybe can install televisions for cartoon or Mtv channels to kill the queuing time. When the kids fuss the parents will lose temper and there goes the holiday. 5. Wondering if this theme park can strictly put under non smoking theme park. Majority is children; we want a healthy clean air. Proper cigarette bin was provided but still they are people blindly throw the cigarette butt around the bin. 6. Consider special admission price for the olds and disables, they will still able to enjoy the shows and attractions in the park even though they are not physically fit for the rides.7. Customer service counter were not well inform on daily schedule event. When ask if there is a band to perform on that day (16th Sept 2012), she told me NO, the band only perform on the opening day. This is not true. When ask if there is firework on that day, she told me NO. This is not true as well. Tips ‚Äì1. Bring sun block, umbrella, cap, mini fan and lots of water. 2. Spend more time on outdoor activities in the morning and indoor activities in the afternoon.3. Legoland is for children and adults too. Few thrilling rides, children are too afraid to ride but the adults enjoy it. 4. The lego shopping should be on the last list, you wouldn't want to carrying the big bag of lego toys around the park.5. Don‚Äôt waste your time Q for the admission ticket, buy on line. 6. Visit Legoland website www.LEGOLAND.my for more information on special rate or event, hopefully the website is up to date. Remark - this is only my personal view and opinion.",3.0
4954,Been there 6 times and we're still going - for young kids,"It's not as pretty as Universal Studios, Disneyland, Movie World and the likes. The ticket prices are also cheaper than those, so don't expect elaborately-built sets and you won't be much disappointed with how it looks. Think Six Flags, Knotts Berry Farm or the Blackpool Theme Park for much younger children.Legoland is for young children. All the rides are not scary. Trilling enough to be fun without scaring the wits out of you. On a weekday, you can go on them again and again. Each section has attractions for the very young (below the height limits) and the young ones. So everyone is entertained.Prices and food at the restaurants are ok but if you want cheaper eats, head out of the park to Medini Mall. There are quite a selection there. Bring cash though, as the credit card system doesn't seem to be up and running at Medini the past 6 times we've been. Legoland accepts Singapore dollars and credit cards. Their exchange rate is reasonable.If you have only a day, you might want to start at The Imagination area and work to the front as most will start at the driving school. If your child is into Lego Mindstorms, then you have to head there first thing to book a slot. Leave the Big Brick Shop till closing time. It stays opened even when the rides are closed. The Miniland was pleasantly surprising. We are really impressed by the details. One can spend quite a long time studying them. You just might lose track of time.Downside: The lack of shade, trees and misty fans. The heat can be draining. The toilets are almost perpetually wet which makes them dirty fast. They staff are trying but wet toilets is the norm in Malaysia, so they won't know they are supposed to keep them dry.Getting There from Singapore:There's a detailed list of bus services available on their official website. With WTS, that departs from Singapore Flyer, you can book a package that includes tickets or just the transfer alone.If you are driving, we find going via Tuas checkpoint much easier. Once you leave the immigration, head towards Nusajaya exit 312 and you'll see signs directing you to the park. It's only about 15 mins from Tuas checkpoint.",4.0
4955,Overrated? Or too high of our expectation?,"The good experience: ¬†staff is very helpful especially to little kids.The bad ones: We went there during rainy season. Many facilities closed when it rains.Legoland should think of a way to compensate their visitors when the facilities closed down. ¬†At least, guiding visitors to facilities that are still functioning, ¬† or provides greater discount in their shops or tickets for next- time visit.¬†My kid was queuing for the 'Driving School' for 35 minutes and the facility shut down before his turn when rains. Like others, we were stranded in the center for another 30 minutes just to wait for the rain to stop.Many visitors ends up in the near by shop buying souvenir, or just window-shopping to spent their time ( which we can do that in any shopping centers for FREE!)You can say blame it on the rain. ¬†However, Legoland should have thought of that before opening their business here.¬†Overrated, and just not worth the money. ¬†Sorry. Blame it on the rain.¬†",3.0

4957,Fun but more improvement needed,"It is a fantastic concept and already seeing more expansion on the water theme park as well as hotel. Overall, echoing what others have said, be prepared - bring enough water, raincoats as theirs cost like RM15 when outside it costs RM5, umbies and also sunblock lotion.The rides hopefully would be maintained well as they are very thoughtful to the family crowd. On a public holiday - the crowd was nuts and waiting seemed forever. Some of the adults wanted to sit on kiddie rides while angst kids and their parents waited for long queues. Not all the waiting queues had lego at the side for the kids to play with and when it poured, there was not enough waiting space for the people to find shelter if they didn't have one.The restaurants were not apt to serve huge groups like in other theme parks like UStudios and also overseas theme parks. Even Genting Highlands learnt the trick - have tons and tons of food stalls and places to eat. One per area/zone plus the outside was not enough to cater for a big crowd.Overall, even with the pack PHoliday, we managed to cover 60% as the place is rather small and the kids did enjoy most of the ride, we loved the indoor playzones where the kids can just run about and not get wet and it was just meant for them and not the adults. The teamwork events were fabulous as well.One bad point - hopefully legoland train their staff not to be rude and shout - it is a theme park, people come to be happy, why be rude to the customers? Why do other theme parks teach their staff to always wave and smile, there are reasons for that as people pay for going in to it. Also one of the staff was passing the legoland payslip to another staff, and this was at a roller coaster ride, people's lives can be jeopardize as the staff paid no attention to what was going on and more concentrated on looking at his payslip.The staff is not that regular at checking the height or even other restrictions.. good i suppose for some but it is dangerous.",3.0
4958,"Only for kid, dont bother too much if you are not with kid","If you a an adult who happen to love lego, just enjoy the miniature land. Non of the ride are for you. All rides are for children. Dont bother queing for anything since you will get dissapoint as an adult. Price of lego merchandise is more expensive than lego store in singapore. The service is so slow. Maybe this is something to do with malaysian. Because service of every other thing in the mall outside legoland is just as slow. The place is extremely hot too. And dirty. If you are used to singapore cleanliness of eveything. Prepared to be surprised. From singapore i go to legoland by taxi which is convenient. But when try to get back we only have bus as option. We have to wait in a bus stop by the street out of legoland. No direction or easy guide on this one unless you are being active and ask around. And the traffic on the bridge to singapore is hell. Also the entrance immigration in singapore with such long queue. Remind me of batam singapore immgration queue lineIf you are not a parent that want to put effort to make your child happy, dont come here. And if you still insist, i am not suggesting going back and forth to legoland from singapore on the same day. Too tiring. And if you are an adult who love lego who insist on visiting. You can come enjoy the miniland and go home. There nothing much for you here",2.0
4959,Legoland Malaysia,"We went w/o big expectations of the place but it turned out pretty well. To avoid crowd, go on a weekday. We went on a monday and the crowd was ok, queued about 15 mins for the tickets (better to pre-buy your tickets online), rides were about 15 to 20 mins queue max for most rides. This park is suitable for younger kids. Teenagers might find it boring as the rides were more the amusement park type, my 11-yr old boy did get bored at some point, unless you are a huge lego fan. But do remember to bring umbrellas and hats and a portable fan if you have cos it can get really really hot, and i mean really hot. There are hardly any trees for shade. if it gets too hot, hide in the restaurant, the shop or the build-a-car lego area, where it is air-conditioned. The shop was fantastic though, a lego-lover's galore. Good to bring your own food as there is only 1 restaurant inside Legoland and at lunch time, it does get quite crowded, and you have to wait pretty long for the food. Service is pretty slow.All in all, I would say my 4 children, aged 2-11, had a good time there. I'm not quite sure if the experience would be as positive if it were crowded and hot !",4.0
4960,Great place for children 4-10,"Our 12 year old was too old to be thrilled by the rides, but good for younger ones. Do buy your tickets online as number of people per hour getting through ticket purchase is very small. As others have mentioned, need more cover from sun and rain. More staff manning rides would help as loading and unloading rides was slower than at comparable parks.",3.0
4961,Huge park and lot of attractions for kids but the food price is expensive,"I was there last weekend, it was jam pack due to school holiday,. It took me 30 minutes just to buy the ticket and the car park was very far from the entrance. Kids will love this park as it has a lot of rides and attractions that are catered for kids. For adults, we do enjoy certain attractions but not all.  Every rides are having long queues, certain popular rides took 1 hour to wait, it needs to be improved as the queue management is not well done here. The Miniland is a must visit place, it is amazed how Legoland staffs can construct such a beautiful and ""real"" building using the Lego. The food price is very expensive and small portion, I suggest you walk out from the park and go to the adjacent shopping complex to have  your meals which the price is cheaper.Please be prepare to go there very early as the park is very huge, one day is not enough to explore all the attractions. Two days are preferred here.",4.0

4965,Over-crowded and poorly run,"We travelled here with our 3 children, aged 10, 9 and 6 and we were all disappointed with the experience. The park was so crowded, (even though we went on a Monday which was not a public holiday in either Malaysia or Singapore) we had to wait minimum 40 minutes per ride, and when we went to try and get something to eat from the Marketplace restaurant in the park it was so busy the queue spilled out of the building. In addition to the overcrowding, there were barely any Legoland staff visible (apart from those operating the rides). Information that the dragon ride was suspended (due to rain) was not given so we waited pointlessly in a queue until we finally asked those further up if anything was moving and only then discovered the ride was not running. It would have been nice to have been told. The water ride was closed allegedly for repair which was very disappointing and possibly something that should be made clear before buying tickets for the park. Finally, the lego shop, though big, is no cheaper - and in fact in some cases more expensive - than shops selling Lego in Singapore.

They would be opened again when it would stop raining. You're in Maleysia!!! Good business for Lego, bad for customers. First and last time we have been here.",2.0
4967,Excellent Park for Kids,"Definitely a must if you have kids between 3-12 years old.  The rides are very kids friendly with the exception of project X.  The park is huge and you need to come very early to cover the whole park in one day.  Trees are rarity here, so heat is sweltering here.  Please bring a lot of water & wet your towel!  Talking about water, the biggest drawback is extremely expensive F&B.  I came expecting to pay premium for park's F&B but paying triple for food is something very hard to swallow (pun intended).  Next grouse is q management system, definitely need to improve to reduce wait time which can be up to 1 hour for certain rides. Highlight of our day is Miniland!

Those traveling with small babies, there is a comfortable baby care centre for children to sleep, rest n mothers to breastfeed. Overall, not too bad..kids will love it.

4970,Good value day out!,"If you are not a high octane adrenaline junkie (and keen on Lego) this is a good place to visit.  After a day there were plenty of rides we wanted to come back and do again so we upgraded to an annual pass as it seemed to pay for itself in just a couple of visits. If you book online 7 or more days in advance you get a good 25% discount plus a food voucher.  Transport there is easy and good value (S$20 per pax) - coach from the Singapore Flyer.  Book in advance so you get a place on the coach and get there 30 mins early as the seat allocation is ""first come, first served"".  I asked how long the coach journey was and was told, ""an hour"" but there are passport/security checks in and out of Singapore/Malaysia so it is close on 2 hours really.  There are plenty of rides/activities that do not involve scaring you witless.  My children loved riding round in the Lego cars (driving school).

The lego theme park brought out the kidult in me.  Rides are not fantastic, and it is not bigger than the above 2 parks.  But still overall, it is still an enjoyable theme park.  Miniland is pretty interesting.Crowd wise, start early at 10 am in the park, and so you can avoid the crowds in the mid afternoon.  I hardly wait more than 10 minutes for any attraction.  Food wise, eat at the food outlets outside the theme parks, which is better.You need not be a kid to enjoy this park! :)",4.0
4976,Asia's Best Themepark - Fabulous,"We were so excited to visit this passing Friday and it was great. I have wrote two blog posts on the whole adventure cause I couldn't cover it in one so go have a look. But a few tips:We started at Miniland, however there really is no need. I would leave this bit till closing time because while all the attractions close down there is some leeway in leaving the park. SSince the park is new none of the trees are fully-grown and therefore there is no shade. It‚Äôs a hot concrete jungle with the best relief found at the many food carts scattered around the place. The other relief can be found in a few of the different lands: Lego building opportunities. Make a start on the rides in the area and then escape to the relief of the air-conditioned comfort of the Lego Centres. Here the kids can make Lego cars and race them, build Lego towns and shake them or try their hand at designer Lego. And best of all the parents sit down and cool off.  Bring a hat & wear lots of sunscreen. Queuing for rides is not that bad at Legoland, other then the fact that there are 40 rides throughout the park so the queues are negligible, certain rides also have Lego tables in them. So when you are waiting for a ride the kids are playing with Lego at the table, easily distracted until it‚Äôs finally your turn. Honestly, they have thought of everything. Save the 4D movie for the afternoon down pour. Granted we attended in monsoon season, but that doesn‚Äôt have to stop you. Most days it will rain some ¬Ω hour to an hour or a little bit more in the afternoon. With most coaster‚Äôs shut down and most Lego centres packed to the brim we headed for the 4D movie. When it finished the rain had stopped and we were ready to get back on the thrill rides.  An umbrella will also be an added bonus for both heat and rain. Eat early or late, the Market Restaurant at 12 o‚Äôclock was manic! But so worth a visit, the food was good and the price was also very affordable.Double strollers are about $10 to hire and are absolutely worth it, carries the kids, the bags, etc. The longest wait was 15 minutes and it was busy with last day school kids. So we were impressed. There are playgrounds at every land and it's great for the kids or one parent to take them too while the other does rides and vice a versa. Can't wait till its all finished... the hotel and the waterpark. GREAT DAY! Take your kids! Ours were 3 & 2. Worth every penny.",5.0
4977,Disappointed,"I have waited excitedly for Legoland  to be opened in JB ever since I heard the news a few years ago. Unfortunately it was a damp squib. We liked the Miniland which has Asian cities represented by Lego brick models - the eye for details, the effort and the sense of humour was really good. But the place did not have the finesse or the atmosphere of Universal Studios of Singapore. There were four exciting rides of which one was not working, the other three were closed for an hour and a half due to rain and when open, the waiting period was between 90 to 120 minutes. The quality and choice of food available was poor. The rain shelters were not adequate. The music played was pleasant but there could have been announcements made regarding the closing and opening of the rides when it rained. We tried to make the best of it and had as much fun as we could but frankly, I considered it a huge waste of the money spent.",3.0

Much hotter than Singapore but this is not helped by very little shade being provided. Its cooking!Rides are Ok but their whole operation needs to be speeded up or made more efficient if queue times are not to get ridiculous. Food offerings were average at best.It really made you reliase how good Universal Studios and HK Disneyland do it when you see the whole operation being done here on a very average basis.Probably won't be going back in a hurry.,3.0
4979,Theme park for younger kids,"I have not been to any other Legoland, so I cant compare.  But I have been to other theme parks and Legoland is not bad, but not fantastic either. I would think that this theme park suit younger kids better, not teenagers! The rides are shorter and there are more rides catering to the younger kids. My 2 kids (ages 8 and 10) enjoyed themselves though. We bought the annual pass cos it made economic sense.  RM140 for one-day pass, RM275 for an annual pass for an adult. Go figure!There are 2 wet rides, 2 rollercoaster kind of rides and the other rides are rather tame!We didnt consume any food in the theme park, cos the food area just outside Legoland offers better options at better prices.  There are KFC, Burger King, Old Town in this food area.  We didnt buy any souvernirs cos the prices are prohibitively expensive!Overall, my children enjoyed the visit.

After hearing reviews of how unsheltered the place was, we came prepared with umbrellas but the rain was still to heavy. There's nothing much you can do or hide out if it pours. The queues are way too long from 45 mins up to 90 mins so we didn't get on any. We finished exploring the entire place within an hour. Kids would probably love it since it's all fun and games. There are only 2 rides which probably suited to the adults more. But it's an eye opener. Will look forward to the opening of the hotel and the water park.",3.0

4982,"Just a ""okay"" place","I just came back from Legoland, JB yesterday night. I would say this place is not a great one. But you can just visit if you want to kill a day and RM 140 :).I went with my wife and my uncle's family. Me and my wife went from Singapore and they came from Penang. For us since the drive was less it was okay. But they came driving all the way from penang to JB. If you are planning to travel such a long distance for Legoland alone. You may have to rethink again. I would say its definitely not worth.This would place would suit kids from 8-14, not everyone.Pros:* The Miniland was really good.* The place was clean and the staff were friendly.* The whole set up and the lego creatures throughout the park were goodCons:* No great rides* Too much waiting time for rides, though the rides were just average.* Too hot, and very less shelters available* 4D show was pathetic, i was waiting for the 4D effect to start, but it ended before it started.* The whole place looks like, the construction has just complete, or work on progress* The lego toys/items were expensive* Really crowded",2.0

4984,"Great place! However, racist slurs and rowdy kids spoil the experience","Went there for a quick getaway with my family. Arrived there at 10am in the morning. It is a very beautifully set place, and is divided into themes. Right at the main entrance, you can see strollers that are available for rent. As this is going to be a long review, hence I will break it into sections:1) The Beginning - There is a main map that shows the location of each and every themed section. Grab a map first! You can choose to proceed left or right, and approximate time taken to complete one whole round is 2 hours. If you get lost, cut right across Mini Land. There's also a washroom on your left, just after the main entrance.2) Lego Technic - As the name implies, it's for all the thrill rides that you like. More suitable for older kids.3) Lego Kingdom - The theme is made to bring back the olden days of magic, kings, dragons etc. There are thrill rides aplenty, and lots of things to see here. There's also a Dragon's Apprentice ride, not as thrilling as the previous themed section (but still fun)4) Imagination - This part gets interesting. There's an observation tower which brings you on a 360* view of the entire world in Legoland. At the highest peak of course! This is also the place where you find the Baby Care room (refer to the photos) and the 4D ride (I didn't take that as it was pretty crowded and the queue was long). Playtown is also located here, where younger children can have fun and play (this was also the place where I experienced rowdy kids, who simply threw lego bricks from one end of the ""seesaw"" to the other - spoilt my experience here).5) Land of Adventure - there's a water ride here, similar to the offering in Universal Studios Singapore. This section is themed pretty much like ancient Egypt. If you have visited Universal Studios Singapore before (where The Revenge of the Mummy Ride is), give this a miss.6) Mini Land - I LIKE IT! Miniature models of famous cities in the world, all done in Lego! There's Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia sights, Singapore (Singapore Flyer, Fullerton Hotel, River Taxi, Capita Land and more!), The Forbidden City in China and also The Great Wall of China! Well made and beautiful indeed!7) Lego City - This is the place where you can find stage performances in City Stage: The Loudest Shout. This also spoilt my experience because in one of the acts, there was a character called ""Mo"". ""Mo"" stood for Monkey. In a themed park targetted at children, I very much doubt that is the right way. Furthermore Mr Safety Detective and the character dressed in red were in constant bickering at times during the show (acting of course), and at times, it felt like racist slurs. For parents who don't like loud noises, you will learn to hate the whistle of Mr Safety Detective. The presentor was not too good too, he seemed to be overwhelmed by the fact that it was Malaysia's first themed park and kept on emphasising the fact of Malaysians being proud of their own themed park. I very much doubt you would find this sort of speech in California, Florida, Billund, Germany, or Windsor.It is a great place! However, racists slurs and rowdy kids spoil the experience.",3.0
4985,Malaysia Boleh?? You bet!,"I was at Legoland Malaysia on 5 Nov 2012 with my spouse and 3 kids (5, 7 & 9 yrs old). As we had purchased annual pass earlier, this was the 2nd time we visited the park, and I must say I was left pretty impressed.Getting thereI entered via Tuas second link. A gentle reminder to top up your cashcard and 'touch & go' card. Couldn't remember the exact charges but its more expensive as compared to Woodlands checkpoint.Once you pass the 2nd link, look out for exit 312. Its towards the direction of Nusajaya and the directional plate for legoland is brown in colour. At some point in time, the directional signage for legoland will disappear. Fret not. Look out for 'Kota Iskandar' instead and travel in that direction.ParkingLegoland's parking is divided into 3 zones. If you are there early, try to park your vehicle at the carpark of Medini Mall, instead of the 3 zones. This carpark is linked to Medini Mall and has the shortest walking distance.Inside LegolandUpon entering, you can either start your journey either by turning left or right. Left hand side is for older kids as it has more adrenalin pumping rides. Right hand side is more suited for kids around the age 3 - 7 yrs old.There are pockets of playground all over legoland. Use those as a resting spot to recharge and hydrate. It was also at one of these playgrounds that gave me the idea on title of this review. My youngest daughter was enjoying herself at the playground in the forestmen's hideout when she accidentally fell and grazed both her shins. Before I could attend to her, 3 of Legoland's staff had rendered first aid to my daughter. I was thoroughly impressed with the swift and prompt response of the staff. Kudos to them for being attentive.In general, we felt that the staff of Legoland are warm and attentive. Smiles can always be seen on their faces and they will spare no effort to greet/encourage/cheer the kids before the start of the rides.FoodAs expected, the price of food inside is marked up about 30% more. My family ordered a family combo at Pizza Mania and it costs RM58.80. Comprises of a 14"" pizza, 4 soups and 4 soda. If you are in the mood of walking, you can always head out of legoland to Medini Mall for fast food such as BK or KFC to settle your lunch and return thereafter to continue.To summarize, my family and I had an enjoyable time in Legoland. If you wish to beat the noon sun, try to reach the park as early as possible, and bring lots of sunscreen or caps for the young. Though the queue is relatively long, the warm and professional staff of Legoland will ensure that everyone will get a turn at the rides.Will I be back at Legoland again?? You bet!!",4.0
4986,Very poor public transport system and very unreliable bus timing!,"Very expensive and crowded. Even though the rides are inclusive, they are not worth the time wasted in waiting for your turn! All the food and drinks are priced to make a quick buck out of you....",2.0
4987,Legoland. Great rides for kids!,Great rides for kids. I would suggest good target age of 12 and below. Any older may find some of the rides too childish. Set up was good.  It can be hot! But all in all a fun day out. Be ready to queue for rides though on weekends!,4.0
4988,Enjoyable time at Legoland Malaysia,"We had a good time, young and old. A few tips:1. We went on a school day, the queue was short or no queue at all.2. Legoland car park was not open. They redirected us to park at zone 3. However we decided to park at the Medini open air mall which is next to zone 3. The walk to Lego land is 5-10 mins covered walk through the mall. 3. Bring umbrellas and raincoat, can be quite hot.4. First thing to do when in park, book a slot at Lego Mindstorm for lego class. We were late, and all slots were taken up.5. Start the park by going right instead of left, it's less crowded.6. There are a lot vouchers to use e.g. 30% discount voucher (from Popular bookstore or go to Toys R Us website, only if you are a Starcard member) . There is another voucher which you can use, One paying adult (RM$140) and one child free. You can get this voucher from UHT packet milk which they sell in supermarket. It comes in packet of 6. The only thing that I was not happy about was the quality of food sold in the restaurant in Legoland. At the pizza place,there were alot of flies around the salad. May consider going to the Medini mall for food. Lots of choices like Old town cafe, thai food, yoghurt stalls and bubble teas.Hope it helps. :-)",4.0
4989,Lots of fun under the sun,"We went to Legoland through Singapore. It was an easy 1 1/2 hour bus ride. The rides were great for kids. The park was big enough (bigger than Universal Studios Singapore) to keep us occupied for the whole day (or may be 2). The tickets are also quite reasonable (compared to other theme parks) and the food was cheap. There's a mall with regular fast food outside the park so that was convenient. I would bring my kids back again. My only complaint is that since it is new, there aren't a lot of grown trees. This makes for a very very very hot day.",5.0
4990,"Great place, expensive food & long queues",Visited on 3 Nov. Weather was good - cloudy but didn't rain till about 5+. Long queues of 45 mins at least for most rides (so the 4 adults in our group split up to queue / accompany our kids). Bring ponchos or rain coats for the kids as they will get wet on the Dino Island ride and it came in useful when it rained!We had lunch at the market restaurant which was super packed. Again the adults had to split up to look for tables and queue for food (about 45 mins wait). A piece of battered fish with limp fries for ~MYR20 and ~MYR19 for pasta with very hard meatballs!  Tour guide told us they are strict about bringing in your own food but our bags were not checked. Next time we will check out the mall just outside for better food!Book your class early at the Academy as we left it towards the end and it was full for the day.My 4.5 years old could not go on all the rides but was happy with the ones she went on. Kids older than 13-14 would not find it that great.,4.0
4991,Nice place to Visit But Could Improve Further,"The place is interesting and fun especially for kids. It is a good place for family outing.Although the park doesn't seem to be big compare to other theme park that I have visited in overseas, but there are quite a numbers of attraction which enough to keep the whole family attention. My daughter was so excited and she had a great fun over there. Luckily we went there during weekday, so there is not much crowd and we get to try most of the rides.But do take note that due to the weather in Malaysia, it is very hot in the afternoon. There is no much shaded area in the theme park. It is really hard to hide from the blazing sun. There should have more shaded area to cater the weather in Malaysia.Besides that, some restaurants eating area is located open area, though it is covered but you will be still sweating due to the hot weather. And if heavy rain, surely it will spill over.During my visit, the theme park haven't completed yet as there are still on going contruction for Legoland Hotel and Legoland Waterpark.Not much to say, but it would be great if the theme park is located in a cooler place.",3.0
4992,Great For Family,"It was a joy watching my 4 year old having fun.Great place for family with kids, period.The only thing worth complaining: why Legoland support smokers?  It is family park, kids are everywhere, why do you make the initiative by designating places for smokers? They do not even care, they smoke at toilets and everywhere. The park should be ciggarette and smoking free.",5.0
4993,Enjoyable but scorching.....,"Legoland with husband and two children. Was impressed with Miniland due to the intricacies that went into the making of each country and even more impressed when some of the items actually moved. Theme park is definitely suitable for young children, not so for adults and teenagers on account that most of the rides are targeted for children. Nevertheless, I had a pretty good time as I could go on some of the rides with my children. Took the wave racer, the boating school, lego mini express train..... Was not too impressed with the staff though they are smiley but i find service pretty slow even if there are no one in the queue. and numerous flies are flying around the food which surprises me on account that the park is new and on the whole pretty clean. Tons of folks queueing on the popular rides thus you must be prepared to stand and wait.  Bathroom while clean does have the stench of urine but at least you do not need to queue for too long. Was at the park from 10.30am till around 4.30pm. By then, we were all grumpy, hot and sunburnt from being BAKED in the sun. We had brought umbrellas, sunscreen and caps but the sun prove too much for us and nothing seems to help. Tempers were also flaring due to the heat and perspiration. One of the major pet peeves about the place is the lack of sufficient shelter, even the duplo town which was sheltered was exceedingly warm as the shelter appears to trap the heat in while the hot air rises. Respite was obtained by buying lots of cold drinks from the little cafes peppered throughout the park. While I do understand that its a theme park and I should be prepared for some sun, the humidity and the heat makes one feel lethargic and tired. I left the place with plenty of fond memories,  a very bad headache plus two children who had bags of lego merchandise and a husband who had turned into a cooked lobster.",4.0
4994,Once is enough,"I will most likely not go back to Legoland Malaysia again, not because the theme park isn't good. It is catered mainly to families with young children or Lego fans.The park seems very big when you look at the park map but it is actually pretty small. There are over 50 attractions printed but most of them don't really appeal to young adults.I would suggest heading straight to Land of Adventure where the water ride is. Although it isn't a deep plunge, expect to get wet! However, not to worry as there are huge dryers (where you can stand in) nearby. There is this laser shooting ride along the way which i felt was alright but may be a little childish for others. There's also this fire-putting competition which allows some good family/group bonding where teamwork is key to winning.The observation tower is another popular attraction. Don't worry about where you are sitting as the tower rotates 360 degrees to ensure you have a view of the entire park. But the park is not fully complete (there's still on-going construction for Legoland Hotel and Legoland Water Park) so, the view may be a little disappointing.Skip the 4D show if you don't have kids because the queue can get very long and the waiting time isn't worth it for that kind of show. I was expecting something similar to the Shrek 4D show in USS but this was a far cry. What we got were gusts of cold wind and foam.The roller coaster ride is at Lego Kingdom where the entrance is flanked off by 2 Lego guards. The queue can get ridiculously long, where the bulk of the people are hidden inside the castle, so don't be deceived. There are some cool Lego displays to keep you entertained along the way. I would say, it's worth it and suitable even for kids. A more thrilling ride would be the Technic Lego Track which features a steeper drop.I personally like Miniland as I was impressed by the Lego models of famous international places. There are friendly staff around who can help you take group photos too.Food choices are quite alright. If the park restaurants are too pricey, there are cheaper options just outside the park entrance like KFC, Old Town White Coffee, Subway, Nasi Briyani and cafes. Note that you are only allowed to exit the park once in a day.Small lockers are priced at 20 RM and big lockers at 40 RM for a full day. So, travel light if you can. For wet and thrill rides, there are places for you to deposit your bags.The park can get blazing hot in the afternoon. Fortunately for us, it was cloudy the entire day and only rained heavily when we left the park.",3.0
4995,"Legoland: pretty good, actually.","Ah, I do love writing reviews, so be patient; this is going to be a long one. We were there with my kids (2 and 5 yrs old)1) Getting there: it was a relatively easy drive from Tuas Checkpoint, the road signs are up and there was little traffic this Sunday morning. Considering this was only our second time driving to Msia, it was no trouble at all. Parking was ample although it was quite a walk to the park itself. Most of the walk is covered.2) Tickets: I got my tickets from WTS Travel Agency, cheaper than what you would have paid at the door. The queue to purchase tickets was not long, though. Entry was quick and easy. You can also buy your tickets in advance online from their website for a discount.3) Have young kids in tow? Consider renting a stroller (single RM20/double RM30) from the Mini Market, right next to the entrance. They were easy to steer, have pockets at the back but I do wish the canopy was a little bigger to shade the kiddos' legs.  Legoland does not have designated stroller parking like at Disneyland but at most rides there is ample space to park them.4) Slip, slop and slap: yes the place was hot. Fortunately, the weather was kind to us today and the heat was bearable. There was a nice breeze coming through as well. Still, slip on a shirt, slop on the sunblock and slap on your hats and sunshades! They only have caps and children's bucket hats for sale there.5) Food and drinks: our bags were not checked at entry, and apparently you could bring your own supplies in, but I would not try rolling in a cooler box packed with food. We brought our own drinking water but there was nowhere to refill other than the taps in the toilet. JB gets their tap water from Singapore, so it should be alright, right? Ha ha...500ml Dasani water sells for RM2.50.We ate at Jungle Burgers (RM64 for 2 burger meals and 1 kids' meal) and Pizza Mania (RM45 for 1 pizza, 1 small cup of fruit, 1 apple crumble and 2 drinks). Each zone had a different menu...Pizza Mania had a good variety and the apple crumble was absolutely yum. Burgers were alright, and the place has a great view of the flume ride.The kids' meal at Jungle Burgers came in a large yellow paperbag, the thick kind, which I feel is absolutely wasteful. Recycling bins are also nowhere to be seen.6) Toilets - large and clean, although wet as all cubicles come with the water hose spray. There is also a large changing table in the ladies and the family restrooms. The family restrooms are large enough to accomodate your stroller etc but oddly enough, no kiddy sink. I had to bring my daughter to the ladies' to wash her hands.There are plenty of toilets although they are usually not easy to spot. You can find them next to all the restaurants and cafes.7) Baby care room: Located at IMAGINATION, look for the large giraffes. Absolutely posh and comfortable! The room has attendants and they only allow parents with children to enter plus you have to sign in and out. There is plenty of seating, rocking chairs for nursing mums, baby rockers, high chairs, a play corner to occupy the other kids, lots of power points and a mini kitchenette for you to prepare baby's feed (microwave, food warmers, kettle). It was also nice and cool, but please don't bring your kids in just to seek refuge from the heat lest you disturb the younger ones who need to feed and rest.8) Safety: My son wandered off a bit while we were having a tea break. We could still see him, of course but within minutes the security officer was with him, thinking that he was lost. 9) General park cleanliness: I read earlier reviews about the park being dirty...I thought it was quite clean other than a few incidents e.g. paper cup in the pond, uneaten food in the playground. Plenty of bins around and tables are cleared quickly.(I just realised I have not mentioned anything about the rides...)10) Rides: If you have a child around the ages of 8-12, they would have a blast here because they would be able to ride pretty much everything at the park. My 2 yr old was limited to a few, while my 5 yr old, who is tall for her age, could take a lot more. The rides are pretty fun, although some were very short. The more popular rides like Driving School, Boating school, Lost Kingdom, Dino Island had about a 45 min wait today, so we skipped those. As per earlier reviews, with my kids, we hit the park anti-clockwise. All rides were operational today, although Dino Island had a fair bit of downtime.What I do like about the rides was most of them had a little Lego corner, and you can put your kid there to play while waiting. Each land also had a playarea, most of which were suitable for the bigger kids. Some of these are covered (Pharoah's Revenge, Duplo Playtown). If your kids do not enjoy rides, the playgrounds should keep them pretty occupied. The large one at Kingdoms (The Forestman's Hideout) was especially challenging, and there was some staff on duty to help the younger ones navigate the structure.11) Souvenirs: a little disappointed with the selection. Am not familiar with Lego prices in SG but earlier reviewers mentioned that the Lego sets are pricier than retail here so we did not buy any. There was really nothing that stood out, just the usual assortment of t-shirts (not very pretty) and lanyards. Even our souvenir family photo does not mention ""Legoland Malaysia"" anywhere. The make your own minifigures seem popular but you may want to go early to get your pick of the parts.If your kids are old enough to take all the rides, you could spend a whole day there easily and maybe still not complete all the rides due to the long wait times. The park looked crowded to me, but it's considered 'Low season' now so it might get crazier when peak season comes. The place got noticeably more crowded in the afternoon, possibly from the coach tours.Thanks for reading, and I hope this has been useful! Enjoy your visit!",4.0
4996,not much fun as its seems to be,"Place is spacious, new and clean. Especially like the clean toilet. But service at the ticketing counter is poor and slow. Games is only restricted to kids. Adults who accompany kids can't join in the fun . A lot more to improve especially in service. Food is expensive and have limited seats in the restaurant.",1.0
4997,WIFI,Legoland is great for the kids but because we have an annual pass so brought my kids there very often. After a few visits we are not as excited as the kids. So I hope legoland managements can have WIFI so that parents can still do their work there when the kids are at play. This would help parents able to bring their kids to the park more often and not affecting their work.,3.0
4998,Legoland Malaysia from Singapore with 2 kids,"Set off about 9:10 am on a Friday with heavy traffic from Singapore near Ikea west side, but still managed to get to Legoland Malaysia by 10:05, and that included a detour to a Shell petrol station to top up the car and get the RM40 discount for Legoland with every SGD50 spent (or is it 70), which is worthwhile, offer ends 31/12/12.  Pretty empty to start with, a 5 minute queue to get tickets, and no queues more than 5 minutes for rides until after lunch, then we would just skip that attraction and find one without a queue.  Yes very hot, but if you are from Singapore or Malaysia, it is business as usual. The staff were very friendly, turning on fans in waiting areas that were not on for some hard to fathom reason, and lots of smiles and ""have a nice time""; English not always so brilliant, I tried to interrogate one staff member on techniques to get the fire engine to move faster in the race, but got no-where (we lost our race).  I read other reviews saying the food was expensive, but coming from Singapore, I thought it pretty reasonable, RM22 for a pizza and RM15 for a burger.  Mind you we brought our own sandwiches and sat in the air-conditioned pizza restaurant eating them, which did not seam to be a problem. My kids 12 and 7 (15 year old wisely opted to stay at home - not really suitable for teenager boys) liked it alot. We spent an hour building lego in the aircon centre for this and racing our lego builds down a ramp (another dad sadly built one that constantly beat mine).  The 4d Film (aircon again) was pretty good also. Rides not on same scale as universal studios, but then it is aimed at younger kids.  The models of Singapore and other cities very impressive.   We were hot and bothered by about 4pm and the place was quite full so we left.  Other useful info: you dont need to fill in an immigration card for Malaysia any more (news to me). My touch and go card (for the Malaysian road toll p about RM7.50 each way) still worked after at least 3 years of non-use.  If you book more than a week in advance online you get 25% off.  Toilets aircon (hooray) and there was loo paper",4.0
4999,love and hate,"i agree with all the positive things said about this place-all true.let me just highlight some pointers from my experience:*super hot place,very bare,small trees,not enough covered area.come prepared with hats/umbrella/fans/sunblock lotion.i understand that the place follows the standard of all other legolands around the world,but i think they should make some adjustment in terms of providing shaded area for visitors.malaysia has summer all year round.it was blistering hot by 11am-imagine having to stay here until evening!*do buy tickets online,for a one day pass,u get a 25% discount.good bargain*the place is not fully completed just yet,they are still counstructing the hotel and water park*the staff are well trained-definitely world class level-thumbs up to that!*ample parking-not to worry*avoid school holidays-though the crowd will spread out,most rides will have a long q-up to 30 minutes for some!",4.0
5000,Lego fans should go,"This place is amusement park with lego theme. Not too big but also not too small. But definitely hot, so prepare sunblock. Most of the game are for kids or teenager. The interesting thing here is the lego figures like people, cars and animals almost all the place. And other thing is miniature of cities in the middle of the parks.",4.0
5001,Fun in the sun???? Not really.,"Plus points:- a lot of info online and you can buy a variety of ticket suits you best- great miniatures and sights of the some of the earth wonders- friendly and helpful staff- a few interesting rides e.g. Observation tower, the Dragon, etc- food and drinks are plenty aroundMinus points:- Boiling HOT!!!!- Not enough shades,fans and trees!!!!- Parking bays looks unfinished and does not depict the international theme park reputation- Toilets are dirty- Expensive by Malaysian standards otherwise alright for Singaporean or European - Crowded (expected) but with the heat outside..doubly worst!- Quite a distance from any reputable hotels. We stayed at the Pulai Springs, 30minutes drive.- Long queue for the rides (expected) but again in the heat...madness!- Not enough benches to rest...with shades please!- Not enough sitting place at the eateriesAll in all, we'd say that Legoland was quite in a hurry to open this park at the expense of tarnishing their reputation. A lot more work could have been done to make this park better for the visitors like planting mature trees, more shades, better facilities etc. Lastly, we would like to point out that Malaysia is a hot, tropical country and the same kind of architecture (design) via large open areas in the sun, does not work well. Maybe in Europe but hell not in Malaysia.",3.0
5002,Hot! Hot! Hot! But Great Detailing at Miniland,"I would suggest that you buy your tickets online (which is 25-30% cheaper) as the queues at the ticketing counter can be very looong. Park operates from 10am to 6pm and you can easily complete it in a day but do go early. There aren't enough canopies so the park can be very hot! They have some benches under some roofing but no fan (they should have more fans) so it can be very humid. If you have one of those fan + water bottle spray with strap, bring it along but if you plan to buy them from Legoland (RM50), quality isn't good and they don't have a strap. After one-time use, my fan does not work anymore and that is a very expensive one-time use, I tell ya! Souvenirs and Legos are expensive for the average Malaysian, even fridge magnets are expensive! There are basically 2 ""extreme"" rides ie The Dragon (lego Kingdom) and Project X (Lego Technic) for the adrenaline junkies. The rest are kiddy rides and the ""medium"" impact ones. Do the Miniland last as it's right in the middle and has hardly any shade so towards evening should be fine. The detailing of the buildings, transportation, ships here is actually quite amazing, using lego parts. Even comes with ""sound effects"" and moving parts. Take a ride around the park on the Legoland Express at Lego City. Queues are not too long but then we went on the eve of a Public Holiday. F&B wise there is plenty to eat and choose from and prices are reasonable for a theme park. There is a huge car park and for now, it is free. Quite a distance to walk from the car park to Legoland but you pass by some shops and eateries along the way. You can see the different phases for this project - hotels, apartments, etc coming up over the next few years so there is still potential to grow. Lots of room for improvement: cooling stations with ice, more fans, more canopies, better quality, more variety and more affordable merchandise would help to boost sales, same as accommodation next to Legoland for easier access. The staff are helpful and make a great effort to speak good English, which is great :)! You can bring in drinks and food in your bag (they also have lockers if you want to use lockers); they are not stringent like Disney.",3.0
5003,Great park,"Lots of different types of rides for different age groups.  Wish the Lego shops were bigger though, similar to Disneyland's shops.  Items were out of stock towards the evening.",4.0
5004,Amazing creativity with Lego bricks!,"Went on 29th October 2012, Monday. It was a school day and possibly still exam period for the Singapore kids. We happened to coincide with 3 big groups of kids on their school outing. Kindergarten age, primary school age and the 16 year old variety. I was kinda like ""Duh...."" to see such a huge group. Fortunately, the place was big and since it was still a Monday, there really wasn't that bad a crowd. After getting our tickets (do look out for discounts from supermarkets, petrol stations etc) we got in immediately with no queue. Start from the Lego City side as many people will aim straight for the Lego Technic for the Project X ride and the Aquazone Wave Racers. We did the counter clockwise direction and I think this saved us alot of queueing time for many of the rides! For younger kids, it will really be fun as many of the rides are very suitable for those from the age of 4-14years. Any younger, they'll have only have the playgrounds and a few very limited rides with parents. Any older, they'll be bored silly!Try not to queue for the Lego land Express as it takes a really loooooong time. Only one train and it goes like 10mins each round! Unless you can get up the first time round, just go straight for the Boating School and don't waste time here! The staff at Legoland has some communication problem in English. They cannot make themselves clear and are usually not very mindful of safety. The rest of the rides at Lego City was ok.  Adventure Land has Dino Island which is essentially the ""wet yourself silly"" log ride type. If you can, do this last. We skipped this and went on other rides first and came back at around 450pm and there was practically no one there! The kids went round on this SEVEN TIMES! And leaving this for the  last makes practical sense too as everyone will be wet and will want to either go to the car and change or go home already (if you live nearby). Changing in the middle of the day is inconvenient and you'll get slightly wet again at Lego Technic. Try out the Lost Kingdom Adventure for the ""shoot shoot shoot"" type of ride. Fun if you like scary stuff of the mummy variety. This ride has many cars and goes very fast and so if you hit the weekends, queue for this as it moves along nicely. Beetle Bounce is a very silly up and down tower like thingy. Suitable only for the 3-6 year olds.Go to Imagination Land next and go for the 4D show at Lego Studios. Even if the queue is long, try to be patient and go for it as they close at 445pm and if you miss this (which we did) you'll probably wanna slap yourself! The Observation Tower at Imagination is also a must go. It's similar to the Tiger Tower at Sentosa. The Tower was cool and it rotated 360deg so you can see all the park and the surrounding areas (nothing much to see in the surrounding). Kids will love this and everyone can cool down in the excellent air condition! Lego Studios was a huge let down as the area was messy, disorganized and the staff was more interested in talking to each other rather than helping you. We walked out after 3 minutes. Don't bother with the Kid Power Tower as that one tires everyone out!! Aching hands and screaming muscles!Lego Kingdoms should be next on your list as The Dragon is one of maybe just 3 thrill rides in the park. The older ones went on this for 4 times as there was hardly any queue. The young ones (not that young, like 4-6) can check out Merlin's Challenge or The Dragon's Apprentice. The castle is also a good photog place as it's really cool with all the turrents and flags and even a Lego mouse on the rocks!Then Lego Technic has Project X, the other one of 3 thrill rides. This is really scary (for me at least!) and older kids will love this. Taking this theme towards the end of the day makes it less crowded as most of the crowd has gone on already. The Aquawave Racers are fun but a tad too short for the length of time we had to wait with so few people. I wonder at weekend crowds!! Technic Twister is just like the Alice in Wonderland teacup spinning thingy. (AGAIN!!) Nothing to shout about unless you like to spin yourself silly and end up nauseous. All in all, not too bad. The food was not cheap but it didn't make me freak. Burgers are really good at Jungle Cafe in Adventure land. Not sure about the rest though. You can bring in water, snacks and they'll just let you in without checking. Just don't be too blatant and cart in a whole picnic basket!Please please use sunblock and bring an umbrella. Don't act cool and walk around unprotected. The heat can literally kill especially if you combine it with rushing around and getting wet, then dry then wet again. There isn't much shade and not many places to hide. Exercise caution and drink plenty of water. Don't take too much of the sweet drinks. Fill up on water instead.Do your research before going and find out which rides are suitable for who and what types of rides are at each theme and you will enjoy yourself to the fullest!",4.0
5005,Must visit now - while the place is still new and functional,"The bad:(1) Not enough greenery and large trees.  This makes hot days really, really‚Ä¶ hot. Don't go if you hate being out in the sun. I absolutely hate people who go but complain about the blistering heat all the time. If you can't stay in then sun, then give this place a miss.  The management could improve by putting in more fans and or cooling mechanisms. Sun block, sun glasses, umbrellas and hats/caps are your best friends. (2) Not enough rubbish bins. Bins are far and few (or maybe they were hidden as i didn't see a lot of them) especially in the waiting queues.  Lack of bins in queues mean park visitors tend to leave their rubbish along walls, wedged between railings, etc.  It doesn't help that many Malaysian visitors are inconsiderate.  They think nothing about leaving their trash anywhere and everywhere except in the bins.(3) Not enough cleaners to roam the park to clean after the litterbugs.  Legoland management should send a team to learn from Universal Studio Singapore on how to keep the park cleaner. (4) Toilets are of typical Malaysian standard, which is unfortunate in a world class park (my opinion).  All cubicles have a water spray (which is all good for the Malay Muslims) but the management has to understand that they are catering to international visitors. And foreign visitirs form more than half the visitors. Every cubicle that I visited had a ""missing"" toilet paper dispenser. I could see the mark on the tiled wall where the dispenser was mounted. But alas, the dispenser was missing. This also means that no toilet paper was provided for the guests. Finally, paper towels are also not available in any of the toilets. The only way to dry your hands was to use the dryers.(5) No water fountains to quench your thirst. Malaysian piped water is clean enough to drink (contrary to many foreigners' view). It would be so much better to have this convenience for the visitors. The good:(1) All the rides shown in the park map were operational.  This was a huge surprise for me.  I was prepared for the worst. ALL rides are still very new and functional. Take this opportunity to visit before things start to fall apart. It is difficult to maintain things in public parks in tip top condition in this country.(2) Great place for younger kids aged 3-10.  Almost all the rides accept kids as short as 100cm.  My two young kids enjoyed ALL the rides that they went on. We also recognized a number of ""signature"" rides which we experienced in Legoland US.(3) Too many rides to complete in one day if you didn't rush from one ride to another. If you have the time, a leisurely two-day visit would be best. Unfortunately the Legoland hotel is not due to open till 2014. You'll have to look for accommodation nearer to Johor Baru town.(4) If you foresee yourself visiting more than 3 times within 12 months, then it is better to opt for the annual pass.  It is a real value for money. (5) Food is readily available in the park and also in the Medini mall right outside the park. Fast food, Thai, local and Chinese food are available. Food prices in the park is also very reasonable. Others:The water park is slated to open in 2013.Legoland hotel is expected to open in 2014. Prams are available for rental.Standard wheelchairs are available but no motorized ones, which is a shame.Some rides will get you wet.  Raincoats (ponchos) are sold at RM15. Bring your own if you have.  Else, use the body-dryers for RM5 per session. Conclusion:Great place for young kids - should not miss. Check the weather forecast before you go. Bring your ""protection"" depending on the weather.",4.0

5009,Blistering Legoland,"Took my 12 & 13 year old kids to Legoland, Johor.  New place and not all rides are operational.  That was a let down, especially the water park!  Its the place to take younger kids in Malaysia.  Attractions and facilites are great but the heat!  Management should open the park earlier - 8 am.  That way you wont suffer from the heat.  Talking about the heat, potential visitors too should factor this in, so please take a shower before you come or at least wear enough anti perspirant/deodorant and fresh clothing so that others among you wont suffer!  The cafe needs to be better managed, no excuse to say that you've run out of chicken and rice at 2pm and ask your guest to come back in 40minutes.  Since not all attractions are available and entrance fee and items inside priced at Euro equivalents, Legoland management should really consider allowing us to enter within this 1 year period with our day tickets when all rides are ready.",3.0
5010,Good fun for young children,"First the positives:1) Its a breeze to get too from Singapore - just 10 minutes from Tuas2) The Annual Pass is a good deal3) Rides our 3 year old enjoyed included: a) lost kingdom, b) duplo playtown, c) boating schoolHere's the negatives:1) It can be blazing hot - it would help if Legoland were to open earlier (say 9am) or close later (say 8pm) . And like others have mentioned, there should be more shady trees2) There is hardly any vegetarian options inside the park. This is disappointing for an international amusement park3) Although most of the rides seemed mild, many still have a height restriction of 1.1 or 1m",4.0
5011,Make Believe Miniatures...,"We visited legoland at the weekend of exactly a month after it began operation. Getting there is a bit tricky. From johor bahru, on plus highway, take the nusajaya exit and follow the direction to medini. Legoland signboard isn't available until that point. Parking space is plenty and free. Entrance fee, that includes access to all facilities, is reasonable considering the quantity and uniqueness of exhibits and fun activities on offer. We liked the miniature replicas of interesting spots in malaysia (kl train station, klia, etc.) and other countries (bali, forbidden city, etc.). The replicas are surreal; complete with background sound of the hustle and bustle of the area. The landscapes are miniaturized life plants. The model of shuttle trains at KLIA can be seen going back and forth from the main to the satellite terminals. In photos the picture looks almost lifelike. There are plenty of eating places around. The open space around the miniland can be very hot. I was wet with sweat at noon and then wet again as it rained in the afternoon. A covered walkway, nicely designed and positioned, perhaps can spare visitors the Tropical heat and the rain. Overall it is an interesting outing, but to make the entrance fee worthwhile be prepared to spend the whole day there.",4.0
5012,Fun especially for kids aged 3-13,"The park is still not 100% completed. For those not in the know, the water ride at the Land of Adventure is not complete, which is a pity because it looks like it will be a major attraction. However, There's still a lot of fun stuff especially for kindergarten and primary-school-aged kids. Still, my 13-year-old and 12-year-old had fun there. Most of the rides seem to be aimed at 3-13 year-olds. This park cannot be compared to Universal Studios, which is aimed at an older crowd. Lego is for kids, after all.The roller-coasters (there's two) seem to be the major attractions, expect long queues even on weekdays. My tip: go during/after lunch when the crowds have dwindled (and it's very hot) and cut down  on your waiting time. If you're a non-rollercoaster-riding adult like me, there's a lot less to do and it will take you maybe two hours to go through the whole park.The 4D is really for little kids but we went and enjoyed it anyway, catering to our childish side for 15 mins (and for an opportunity to get out of the heat).Based on the reviews, everyone seems to complain about the heat and YES, it's REALLY, REALLY hot. No wonder the water attractions are the most popular ones, There's fountains for the little ones to cool off but do come prepared with straw hats, sunblock and water spray, or purchase a battery-operated water spray fan at their souvenir outlets (pretty pricey at around RM50 though). There's a few food outlets but it's mostly snacks like burgers and hotdogs, and in the Restaurant which is supposed to be serving both Western and Asian food, the only ""Malaysian"" choice seemed to be Chicken Rice. During lunchtime the place was packed and we waited till the crowd had cleared by 2pm, by which time we were told they were out of chicken rice and the waiting period was 60 mins! Roast chicken--waiting time 20 mins! Shows poor planning and needs to be addressed asap. However, there are plenty of eateries at the mall outside and we saw quite a number of families taking an exit stamp to eat there.My tip: start off at Build&Test, which requires advance booking of places and takes a bit of time, or at the Driving School, which also takes a bit of time and parents need to wait it out. My kids enjoyed the Driving School even though they are a bit older, especially because they are issued with a ""Driver's Licence"" at the end.All in all, don't book a season pass unless you live in the area. Take a day pass and if you like the park, you can ""upgrade"" to an Annual Pass. We arrived promptly at 10am without advance booking of tickets, and were done around the park's closing time at 6. It would probably take longer with more children or if you do every single ride.Special note to Singaporean vsitors: don't bother to check into a hotel as the distance to Legoland from major hotels in JB is about the same distance as from Singapore.",4.0
5013,Without a child? Forget about it...,"I was visited Legoland on October after a month the opening ceremony. I went on weekdays around 2pm. No need to queued up at the ticket entrance. Can park your car easily near the Mall of Medini. The ticket price is RM140, but if you show your MyKad, you will get discount RM30. If you to buy 10tickets, only 1 MyKad to show to the counter.After you enter, my advise, start counter-clockwise. Why? Because, if you follow clockwise route, the first area is LEGO Technic. Believe me, you don't want to ride the TWISTER TECHNIC for your first ride in Legoland. It will spoil your mood. You will get headache and nausea. (Based on my one experience).Start at LEGO CITY. Ride the Lego Express as your introduction ride. I love lost of adventure ride! Both rollercoaster, The Dragon & Project X, you should try as an adult. Most of the games not suitable for adult except those two.You can watch 4D movie unlimited at IMAGINATION. Feel the snow drop on your hand & head inside the theatre. The movie is every half hour.For souverniers,  there were to expensive. The theme park T-shirt is not that interesting! Not worth it to buy. Also, the fridge magnet, no theme park trademark at the magnet. So sad!What I love most is MINILANDS. Impressive!!Conclusion: Once visit is enough. I didn't bring any child. Not worth it. No major ride. All just a cliche ride where you can find in any theme park.",4.0
5014,Not that good,"Visited Legoland with my wife, 5 year old son, and 10 year old daughter. I guess an adult giving an impression of a children's theme park is hard, but here we go.The park has just opened so everything that is open is in tip top condition. The night before we traveled I did a check on the web site to see if everything was open (no mention of ride closures), and there was no sign at the entrance that one of the major rides was closed - so was very disappointed to find that the log flume was either under repair, or still being built.Rides where OK, my son enjoyed the Project X and Dragon Roller Coasters. My daughter and my wife went to the Lego Adventures 4D movie, and came back to us with a don't bother!!!!!We all went to the Lego City Stage, which had a show with some acrobatics and then a stage show about safety in the house - very corny to say the least.The Lego models that are placed around the park, and the mini city where amazing and it was easy to see the hours that had gone into building the city replicas.We had lunch at the Knights Feast food stall - food was good, with excellent sized portions.We had planned to spend two slow days in the park, but decided to rush through the rides that looked interesting and look elsewhere to fill the second day of our short trip - off to Singapore we went.Truthfully you only need one full day to take in all the park - especially if you do it outside off local school holidays, although there where a few local school's doing field trips in the park.This was our first visit to a Legoland, and we will be back only because we bought a season pass, but there is no comparison between Legoland and Universal Studios, Singapore (where we spent our second day).",2.0
5015,Not suitable for a tropical climate....,"Went to visit Legoland in October 2012 and found the place to be quite entertaining but I will not highly recommend it...yet.  I don't think the park is quite ready. I like the idea of having an outdoor park in a tropical climate country but they must ensure there are enough shades to protect their clients for the blistering heat and sun on a sunny day.  The place has not got enough shades and trees/landscaping are not much of a help as they are just being planted.  The waiting areas to get into rides should be well air conditioned, instead we were forced to wait in line in a fan cooled area which I found really uncomfortable especially when is crowded.  After half day in the park, you will be drenched in sweat and you will have to abandon most of the rides as the heat was just too much to bear.Put in more shades and better waiting areas for rides then I will recommend this place...until then you might want to give this place a miss or at least until the trees are grown and  able to provide better shades.  Overall great fun if you have kids with you, they are going to love it.     ",3.0
5016,Good for a day,"Many theme parks cannot be covered in a day but at Legoland, you can... perhaps until the Legoland Waterpark is opened next year.  And the hotel will be ready in 2014.  My son is a huge fan of Lego and we finally managed to go on a weekday which was great because sometimes, we don't even need to queue.  Also because it's not the school holidays.  It really takes 10am - 6pm on a weekday to complete all the rides.  The rides that involve water and height usually have long queues.  So, it's best to just take whichever ride that have short queues and go back to those rides with long queue towards the end.  The only downside is the food.  Food is pricey but with small portion and taste only so-so.  I suggest that if you're going for a day to take a heavy breakfast, bring a bottle of frozen drink (frozen overnight that it becomes a huge chunk of ice in the morning) and let it gradually thaw towards the day.  This way, you'll have enough cold water to keep you hydrated throughout the day.  And if you're afraid of getting hungry, maybe sandwiches will be great.  If you would like to purchase bricks of Lego, go to the Brick Shop.  You can pick and choose for RM35 for 100 gram which I think is well worth it to add to your collection at home.  Miniland should be visited last.",5.0
5017,Great for children under 10.,"Visited on a Monday with our two daughters aged 7 & 9.The rides were all appropriate for their age level, but would seem pretty boring to anyone over the age of 12 I think.The crowds were not too big, with the longest wait we had being about 12 minutes.Staff were all very friendly and helpful. Food was reasonably priced, but do take lots of water, as it was very hot and there wasn't a lot of shade.Taxi - we caught a red/yellow taxi from Pulai Springs to Legoland for RM$35. However the blue taxis hold the licence to have taxis at Legoland, so we took one for our return trip and it cost RM$58....so try and get the red/yellow taxi if possible.",4.0
5018,Delightful‚Ä¶ but not perfect,"We have an annual pass and have already visited more than five times in the last month. We have three boys (ages 3, 7 and 8 years) who are OBSESSED with Lego. For this reason, it was our destiny to love Legoland, and I can honestly say we weren‚Äôt disappointed.However, it‚Äôs not perfect.Our 3 year-old is relatively tall and can therefore ride on most things (e.g. the Dragon Rollercoaster). But bizarrely is prevented from riding the log-ride?! Our 7 and 8 year-olds can ride on everything.Food options inside the park are not bad, and compared to theme parks in US and Europe the prices are OK. However, the queues at lunch can be off-putting. Tip: inside the various ‚Äúrestaurants‚Äù there are separate counters with separate servers so look carefully at the queue. The queue for the pizza counter was extremely long, but the pasta counter had NO people waiting‚Ä¶ it's deceiving so don‚Äôt just jump in the queue. Also, the adjacent mall has some cheap and convenient food options.The quality of the park is pretty good, and I was pleased to see the South-East Asian theme in Miniland. Very impressive. The various Lego constructions around the park are cute and well-executed. Try to avoid holidays and weekends. Most of the visitors seem to be local, so weekdays are still fairly quiet. The difference in wait-times for the popular rides can be 75min on the weekend compared to <5min on weekdays.One MAJOR problem I think the park will struggle with‚Ä¶ the common practice of smoking inside toilet cubicles. Every time we‚Äôve visited I‚Äôve encountered this problem. If you encounter this, please alert one of the park employees as it‚Äôs not allowed and they can only address the problem if they know about it. If anyone from Legoland is reading this‚Ä¶ please install signs and smoke alarms in the toilets and have attendants stationed to address this incredibly unhealthy practice. International visitors will not be impressed with this problem. And my final MAJOR issue‚Ä¶ the total lack of shade. Even looking around at the landscaping, it seems unlikely the trees will ever provide sufficient shade (even after they‚Äôre fully grown). It needs more trees and more sun-shades. It‚Äôs not a minor issue‚Ä¶ this part of the world is SUNNY and HOT so lack of shade can significantly impact the enjoyment of the park and even the thought of returning makes me break into a sweat. Tip: bring sunscreen, hats, water, umbrellas, handheld fans‚Ä¶ anything to keep you covered and cool.Overall, we really do love Legoland and will definitely return‚Ä¶ probably more often than I prefer :)‚Ä¶ and I think it will only improve with age as the trees grow and they iron out the small hiccups.",5.0
5019,Legoland Malaysia,"Lots of fun but don't go on weekends! The queues were extremely long and it typically took about 45 minutes to an hour to join one ride. I think it was very crowded due to the weekend. The best part for me were all the colorful Lego men and miniatures. Also, watch out for pickpockets and take care of your belongings, my friend lost her phone that way.",4.0
5020,Advice on getting to Legoland from Singapore,Legoland was great and well worth going to - it ticks all the boxes as you would expect.  But wanted to share advice on getting to Legoland from singapore as it is not streamline yet - the only operator we found was WTS Travel singapore - book your coach tickets in advance (coaches go from the Singapore Flier Coach park).  It is all so new that few hotels know how to get you there and few direct coaches are operating.,5.0
5021,"Great place except for the ''build it"" area","Clean, friendly, fun.  Enjoyed the food (albeit not Malaysia pricing) and the atmosphere.  Staff all had smiles.  One disappointment - my 3 kids in the build it area - waited 30 mins to receive wheels so they could race cars and still never had a turn.  Some kids there had 8 wheels whereas others had none.  When I complained, was told that they originally opened with 100 wheels but they had whittled down to 20.  We were there on a weekday, not crowded, but 50 kids were sharing 20 wheels.  LEGOLAND only has 20 wheels????  Come on! That's preposterous!  What is it like on a Saturday??",5.0
5022,"In my opinion, best suited for kids below 13","Pluses - it is reasonably big and well laid out.  The rides were fun and the kids thoroughly enjoyed them.  Lots of play areas so good chance for adults to rest.  Negatives - not enough shade so if it is a hot day, its really hot and if it rains, the restaurants will be spilling over.  My take - its one where the younger kids will enjoy and not be too frightened by high speed, noise.  Enough rides and play areas to keep them occupied. We went on a weekday so the queues were reasonably short.  If the kids want to play with Lego bricks at ""Build & Test"", best to go early so you have all the different lego paraphernalia to choose from. Would have given it five stars but was put off by the state of the toilets.  Been to other theme parks and the toilets are always so clean.  Legoland toilet standards are definitely way below others especially for a brand new theme park!",4.0
5023,nice day out for young kids,"We went on a Thursday and found the park quite empty. There were virtually no queues anywhere. My children aged 3 and 7 really enjoyed the Build and Test area, Driving school and the various playgrounds including Pharaoh's Revenge. Dino island was a bit of a disappointment as I was expecting some more detailed theming inside the ride. we enjoyed going up on the observation tower as it gives a very nice view of Legoland. we also enjoyed the 4D movies at Lego Studios. the graphics were very sharp and above all it was the best way to escape the scorching heat outside :) We had lunch at Pizza mania. I found my Aloha chicken pizza a bit bland.There was a wealth of detail in MiniLand. you can easily spend some time just wandering through, looking at all the displays. My tip would be to do the rides like Boating School and Driving School early in the day and keep the airconditioned attraction for the middle of the day when its hottest and get to MiniLand towards evening when its a bit more pleasant. it started raining at 3 o'clock and to our surprise they closed most of the rides, even the ones indoors. I can understand them closing rides like roller coasters and others that would present some safety risks, but I didnt understand why they closed lego studios, lego academy and other indoor things. The only two attractions open that I could see were Build and Test and Technic Twister. We felt a bit cheated as we hadnt tried Boating School and Aqua WaveZone and the kids really wanted to try those two rides. By the time we left at 5:30, they hadnt reopened the attractions even though the rain had stopped.",4.0
5024,atmoshphere,"Went to legoland at Johor Bahru Malaysia. It is definitely for the younger children. Compared to Universal Studio at Sentosa, Singapore, my children prefer Legoland to Universal Studio though adults may prefer otherwise. What I personally feel that it lacks the merry atmosphere... there is no 'in-house' music. They should have speakers at different parts of the land and play some merry music. It's quite boring expecially for those in the queue waiting for their rides.I think it applies to any crowded place. Do check which queue you are in. There are more than 1 queue in the Market Restaurant. Many people just joined the 1st queue till outside of the restaurant when actually there are several queues in front of different counters, depending on what food you want to purchase.",4.0
5025,LEGO!!!,I mean what more could you want... It's Lego!I must see. When we went not all the rides were operational. This was unfortunate but we think it's mainly because the park had only been opened for a week. However this was a minor set back in the bigger picture. There are Lego sculptures everywhere and they are highly entertaining and fun to pose with. Even more impressive is MINILAND where they have recreated many of the icons of South East Asia with Lego. You can lose yourself in the world they create with so many fine details. And keep your eye out. The creators obviously have a sense of humor.,5.0
5026,Extremely hot but good for kids,"We had a great day at Legoland. Overall I believe for kids, its great but there is room for improvement.First it was exceedingly slow to buy the tickets on the day. I wasnt sure that we were going for sure, so I did not buy them ahead of time via the internet. Next time I will try this way. We went on a weekday. It seemed pretty quiet so I cant comprehend why it took 10 mins per group to issue tickets!Once in it was great. My son (who is 5 and lego mad) had a brilliant time on all the rides. Luckily enough we did not have to wait for long for any of them. It is hot..... Hotter than expected. For some reason it seemed a lot hotter than Singapore where we had come from. Do come prepared for this........The other issue was the time it took to get lunch. We opted for pizza and it seemed that there was one person making and cooking them only. The wait was a good half an hour. (and they werent very good to boot) I really think they can do better on this front.I have not been to any other lego lands so I cannnot compare but we had a really enjoyable day bar those 2 very small issues and we are already planning a return visit",4.0
5027,Great attraction for the kids,"Everything is new since it opened 1 month during my visit. Kids or LEGO lovers will definately love the attraction. Do visit on weekday as there is not much crowds inside the park, hence you could try out most of the rides avaliable. Definately more rides or new theme needed to attract the people back to the park. The foods inside the theme park is pretty decent and priced. Not that expensive compared to other country theme park i had travelled before. It can get really scorching hot and humid weather with no much shades or shelter for you to hide. Easiest choice would be entering into any air conditioned restaurant, cafe etc. LEGO sets are pricy compared to Singapore departmental stores or Toy R Us. Not really worth buying unless it is pretty rare. If you are taking coach from WTS Travel coach at Singapore Flyer. Do reach earlier to collect your admission tickets as it can get pretty chaotic and slow.",3.0
5028,Legoland,"Firstly very easy to get there following the signposts and car parking is currently free. Park in Car Park 3 for access to the entrance via the mall which doesn't have many shops but has some good food shops that kids will like (Burger King & KFC). We waited just 20mins to buy our ticket from the ticket booth and I would recommend that if it is anticipated to rain in the afternoon, go on the rollercoaster rides first as these rides will close if the rain is torrential. There is plenty to do though if it does rain and the food is excellant with reasonable prices. Some rides there was no que and some rides we qued for 20 mins. They are very strict on the height for some rides (Dino ride) so it's not worth standing in line if you are less than 120cm to go on this ride (even if you are with an adult). A MUST is sunscreen and sunhat (or umbrella) as you could get burnt otherwise. The mainly shaded areas are when you are waiting in line for rides. My son was very disappointed as it was his birthday and the main ride he wanted to go on was the train and this was not in operation. He was so sad but we'll return so he can go on the ride he really wanted to on his 6th Birthday.",5.0
5029,"Everything is neat, friendly staff and day-full of fun","I was very impressed with the quality of everything - definitely, international level is maintained throughout.We arrived at 10am on a weekday, parking was very easy, and most of the rides had no more than 10 minutes waiting (except for 1 or 2, we had to wait about 30 minutes).Lego is just the branding. Except 2-3 attractions, rest weren't really Lego-involved. Website says that park is tuned for 2-12 years, but I would say it is more for 6-12. There are many small play activities for 2-5 years but I don't see a reason to pay the ticket-price for it (including the adult who is accompanying). For kids who can run around on their own, this is a wonderful place and will keep them occupied throughout. There are 15-20 attractions where adults can also join the kids and enjoy.We managed to go through all major attractions from 10am to 6pm on a single day. However, I assume that it won't be possible for a school-holiday or a weekend.Park is not very big and it seems safe for kids to run around - not much chance to get lost.Restaurants within the facility (outside gates of the park) got good food at reasonable prices.We will be going there again!",5.0
5030,Still need more improvement on the rides & it's very HOT!,"Location : - Almost around 4hrs+-5hours to reach from PJ to Legoland. Note: leisure drive, no speed and half way stop at Seremban for bfast-Huge parking space but some area zone been closed down and only allow to park at certain zone. Environment/Theme Park- It's VERY VERY HOT!! Bring umbrella, wear cap, put sun block!- But it's better sunny day than rainy day. Else your ticket will be wasted.- Place is huge but the trees are tiny - still growing. Therefore it's so hot and don't feel any shaded places around. Every where you go are exposed to sun. :(- Don't have the excitement of 'WOW' when you enter the Legoland. The decor, the rides, the park (few theme park) feels so miniature and small in such a huge land.- Close at 6pm on weekdays. Legoland closed on every Wednesday Rides:- Not much rides for adult. Mostly for kids. You still can Q and play those kids ride BUT take note most of it have some kind of weigh limit. If you are too heavy, you are not allow to play. - Water park yet to open. 2013 expected to be ready- Not advisable to go during weekend or PH. We went during weekdays also full of ppl and some rides need to wait up to 30-45mins. Can't really finish all the ride if you plan to do so. Pick the one you want to play first.Restaurants/Lego Shop- There are quite a few of restaurants and easily can find one to buy some snacks/foods/drinks but it's not cheap. Food sucks too.- Long Q again. Better get a table first before ordering. - Few Lego shops but the big one will be at the entrance named - The Big Shop. Note it closed at 6pm on weekdays.Overall, I guess better wait until Water Theme park is ready only visit or when they added more adult rides. It's still very empty, hot and nothing much to play unless it's your kids that want to go. However those status/figurines inside the park made of Lego are really AMAZING!",3.0
5031,Needs more ride for kids and adults,I went to legoland recently with my family.  The overall experience just does not have the 'wow' factor.  I think that it still needs improvement and expansion fast if it needs to keep up to it's reputation and encourage people to return for subsequent visits.  Legoland Malaysia is kind of small in size as compare to Legoland Florida or Legoland California and many rides are not available.  I think it would be great to have more rides that could attract adults as well so that the whole family can enjoy.  The food is mediocre and limited for choice.  The price paid for this type of food is not worth the value.  I really hope legoland Malaysia could expand and improve to keep up to it's reputation.,2.0
5032,Legoland Malaysia 1st in Asia,"Just came back from Legoland Malaysia. Luckily bought an annual pass because you can't really play all the games in a day. Perfect place for family especially a family with little ones. But my children enjoy more at the extreme attraction. The wave racer, technic, dragon roller coaster, and rescue academy were the most happening attraction. The rescue academy demand cooperation among family members and it really fun. If anyone wanted to enjoy more on the attractions the best time to visit is on the weekdays. The weekend crowds are really packed which may make you lost the mood to enjoy. The operation on some attractions are quite slow and you have to be extra patience plus in the afternoon the heat could get up to 42 degrees. Bring along lots of water.The food are expensive and the quality is not up to expectation. There is a Medini Mall opposite the theme park just a walking distance which offers varieties of food at reasonable price. Souvenirs and lego are the expensive. Lego are priced same as Toys r us. You can get cheaper in Singapore. Only if you are looking for rare item then it is worth a purchase. Do not forget a visit to the miniland to watch various monument all over Asean region. The night view is so beautiful. The operation on weekdays are up until 6 pm and on weekends are up to 8 pm. Lego water theme park is coming in 2013 and Lego hotel will be operting by 2014.",3.0
5033,"Small, inefficient and not suitable for young kids","I hope the park never gets too many visitors because ypu will spend the entire day in line for one ride at the rate they have organised it. There was not much on for my 6 year old ( the age range for all rides is 120 cm tall and 6 years old. The food is average and it is all pretty bare. Not what I would have expected from the Danish kings of childrens toys. The park will live off the one time never to return crowd for a while, but a great future it does not have. A shame.",3.0
5034,More suited for kids,"Everything seems to be designed with a purpose to make a kid happy. While I having nothing against this, adults would be left wondering what's in store for them; to which I would reply, nothing.Food selections inside the theme park are scarce, fairly expensive and not so delicious. I've had better.The sun is scorching hot, so do remember to bring along umbrella, hats and caps. I wouldnt recommend this for adults, but for children, it is a must-visit place!",3.0
5035,Nice Place for Small Kids,If your kids is less than 10 years old they will surely enjoy this place.  I  brought my 5 and 3 year old kids and they had a great time.  The only problem is that the weather is hot.  But the over all experience is great and the food is not so expensive.,4.0
5036,Great fun place for family & kids,"Logistics: we went there via WTS coach package (inclusive of admission tickets). As the response was kind of over whelming even during weekday, the registration at the Singapore flyer can be pretty chaotic so advise is if you taking the earliest bus at 8:30am ( reached the Legoland  around 10am) do be there earlier to collect your tickets as the coach is filled by first come first served basis. Similar fro return trip, if you signed up for later return coach, don't expect to take the earlier coah as the bay is full of people to catch the first bus back home.Legoland: Pro: - there are quite plenty of staff who are readily available to offer photo taking and direction. If you like professional family taking photo, this is a good service to take nice photo against the mini land background. Photo are available for review at the brick shop right at the entrance. Per photo is 30ringgit, while 3 photos are at 70ringgit. Go for the memorable photo print on the Lego brick which cost 150ringgit but it worth it as you don't get to see it else where!- there are variety of games for kids of all ages, preferably minimum 3years and height of 100cm for most rides. Else they are limited by only less than 2-3 rides but the kids can still have quality fun time at the Imgaination section where they can assemble Lego cars and Duplo Playtown where they can run freely on the enclosed shelter playground. There are primarily 3 rides only for the more adventure ones : Project X, The Dragon and Dino. The 3d show is a must try, quality experience with at least a 15mins show time.Cons:- although the waiting time wasn't long (15mins or so and perhaps is weekday) but within a month of opening, there are already couple of technical faults. We were unable to try the Dino island ride and Lost Kingdom Adventure laser rider due to technical problems. Kind of disappointment...- the food queue was kind of long with limited selection even though we ate at 1:30pm which is suppose to be off peak lunch time.Lastly is the weather, very hot and humid so prepare with hat, lot of water and raincoat as typically rain shower occur in the mid afternoon time. The souvenir shop is a must for kids to bring a memorable experience back (although the price I would said is higher than the usual Lego boutique shop). Well, might be back when the hotel is ready by 2014, looking around..there are plenty of land space to expand so hopefully they can consider enhancing the Legoland with more fun experience as the park typically can be completed within 3/4 of the day.....",4.0
5037,Great for lego lovers,"We visited Legoland, Malaysia 2 days ago on a weekday and were delighted to find out that the place was not crowded. The longest waiting time for any of the rides there were maximum 20minutes though we can get on most of the rides almost immediately. At times, we were almost the only family enjoying the ride, especially in the morning. Comparing the intensity of the rides, I would say that the ""Thrill factor"" is just moderate.We were most impressed with ""Miniland"", the lego pieces which they put together are really professional and lively, replicating the important architeactures of the various Asia countries. We took the most photos here. The lego boats, planes, cars, people, etc are even moving or dancing at the various locations to add live and humour to the Miniland. It was really amazing!My girl enjoyed the driving school most and she got her first ""driving license"" there. The school was very well organised and the children had to go for their classroom briefing first before they hit the road with working traffic lights and various road signs. It was an interesting experience for her.As the legoland is less than 1 month old, there's still some operation issues here and there. During our visit, the observation tower and boating school were closed for more than an hour due to technical issues. And we were quite unlucky to be hit with an afternoon shower where almost all the outdoor rides and activities were closed, thus we didn't manage to complete all the rides and activities in legoland. Nevertheless, it's still an enjoyable day trip for us. Probably we will be back again after they complete the waterpark and the hotel.",3.0
5038,Fun for kids from 2yr onwards,Kids have a great time. Great facilities for breast feeding mum and babies. Will want to go 2nd time. ,4.0
5039,"Legoland.... long queues on the outside, short waiting times on the inside","I brought my 3 younger kids ages 11, 6 and 4 to Legoland on my own. We arrived by JB - Woodlands checkpoint. From JB Central, a taxi ride costs RM40 ( max) and takes on 1/2 hr to get there.The taxi dropped us at the Mall ( New and big and clean) which is located just beside Legoland. It has many food outlets so no problems with food.OMG!!! The queue for the annual passes booked through the internet was crazy. We had to wait 1.5hrs in line!!If you do not care for the 20-25% discount on tickets, just get your annual passes on site, there was practically no queue, same for one-day tickets. NO queue!! If only I had known. We got to Legoland at 1.30pm, only really got into the themepark at 3pm and left around 6.30pm. (official Closing time is 6pm on weekdays). We were there on Friday 5th Oct 2012.THE GOOD NEWS!! There was practically no queues for the rides. We went for each ride twice!! But because we only had 3 hours there, we only managed 2 worlds... so we definitely have to go back again.The annual prices are relatively inexpensive and if you have kids below 12, this is the option you should take because you will definitely be going there more than once in a year!My kids love Legoland so much that we are going again in October!!We're from Singapore and after a very enjoyable day in Legoland, we took a private car back to Singapore. It costs around S$70 to S$80. But it was defintiely worth it as the kids got to sleep in the car and we didn't have to get off for the passports to be stamped.You don't need to have your own car to get to Legoland, transport is readily available. Like I said, we will definitely be going again and again and again ~ we don't have to pay and queue anymore.. we have our annual passes ;)",5.0
5040,Legoland - for the young & young at heart,Legoland that is for the young & young at heart - it''s targeted at main age group of up to 12 but I enjoyed the miniland tremendously as I felt that they did such a great job putting the pieces of lego people to make the various locations all so real & lively. Worth a visit although it can be pretty hot in the tropical heat (nothing that a little air conditioning at the 4D theater shows won't be able to cure). Another thing to note is that the restaurants can be a bit pricey so hop to the lrestaurants just outside for your meals before heading back into the theme park for the 2nd half of the day.,4.0
5041,Legolego,Brand new and still completing areas.Great day for kids. PrObably best suited to 4-10 year olds but enough to do if you have kids outside these ages. Transport options still confusing from Singapore. We had a taxi arranged by the hotel for four of us but there must be cheaper options. We went on a weekday and were able to hardly line up for rides! Not enough shade as yet - take your sunscreen ,4.0
5042,Give it a chance!,"Legoland is just located nearby of second link Tuas Singapore. Entrance fee of Rm140 for adults, RM110 for kids and senior citizen respectively. Greatly IMPRESSED by masterpieces  created by pieces and pieces of Lego!! Such a good job!  Have fun on the rides and photo taking! All the best to Legoland Malaysia! I am sure there is more and more attraction and improvement in Lego land Malaysia in coming future!",4.0
5043,Great place for the toddler and kids. Interesting rides.,"I went Legoland Malaysia on the 2nd day of opening on 16th Sep 2012. It was a long queue in a hot weather to get my family annual pass. But this was expected. Overall the rides was interesting and more suitable for family w young kids. The souvenir and food are quite expensive, chicken rice set cost abt RM$20, an umbrella cost RM$70. There was an incident in the 4D cinema. A Singaporean lady and a Malaysian man was quarreling very loudly to the point of almost fighting inside the cinema and outside after the shows end. I believe the root cause of the fight was because of the way the usher allows the patron to come into the cinema and sit wherever  they want. They should follow what USS, Disneyland HK, Jpn and other theme park I visited do for such shows. The patron are requested to move in to the last seat in that row and fill up all the gap. If not, a family of 4 like mine will find ourself seating separately. It is not good if there are kids in the group. The quarrel I witness happens because incoming patron has to asked seated patron to move in and sometime the tone and manner is lacking and temper will flare!",3.0
5044,A MUST for family with young kids and Lego lovers,"We, 2 adults and 2 kids, went to Legoland Malaysia from Singapore. We took the direct bus from Singapore Flyer to Legoland operated by WTS. Please note that there is no online booking of bus ticket and it would be better to come earlier to guarantee a seat on the bus. Once arrived Legoland, it turned out that there was not many visitors. Almost no need to queue for all the rides. My kids, 4 and 5 yo, could take many rides by their own and they enjoyed the rides very much. As the theme park is new, all the facilities were in good order. The other good thing is that the costs of F&B items were not expensive  (comparing to other theme parks in Hong Kong and Gold Coast). A bottle of water only cost RM$2.5. The only negative thing was that the heat was unbearable. But you can always hide in those air-conditioning attraction to take a break. After 4pm, the sun was more merciful and we was finally able to take a look of the Mini-land. There will be a Lego Warerpark in 2013 and Lego-themed hotel in 2014. I am sure we will come again!",5.0
5045,Fun but ban smoking please and clean the toilets!,"My girls aged 4, 7 and 9 had lots of fun. They loved the driving school and the rides. The queues were short even though it was a Sunday afternoon, maybe cos it was exam season.Just like another reviewer, I felt the toilets were wet, smelly and dirty. The cleaners need to ensure the floors stay dry cos there was a bad smell. They need to ensure the toilet paper are topped up as well. Other big problem I have was that they allow people to smoke in the park! Come on, it's a kids park, why allow smoking?",4.0
5046,Legoland Malaysia Boleh!,"Went to Leogland with my family (wife and kids 9,7,5).  Wonderful weather with clouds blocking the heat of the sun.  There were rides that were age appropriate for all my kids. Spacious, colourful and engaging.  Good place for a day of family fun.  Easy to reach via Tuas (2 link) from Singapore with good signs. Annual pass is probably worth it.  But the queue to get our photos taken for the passes Hummmm..... well let's just say I am thankful that I only need to queue just this once.  Thereafter, it is direct entry!!Should have included seasonal live size Lego characters (eg, Nijago, Hero Factory,etc...) walking around and for photo sessions. On the whole, we had a great time there!",4.0
5047,Great attraction for kids under 12yo,"Went to this attraction just recently, and I must say that the family had loads of fun! The park is catered primary for kids from ages 3-12yo. My 3 kids totally enjoyed themselves, and there were lots of activities that my 4yo girl could go for. If you have young children, there are lots of playgrounds, and if you are a teenager to adult, the park offers 2-3 rides for this age group. If you are coming into Asia, make Singapore your base, and travel in to JB from Singapore. It is only about at max - a half an hours drive, and easily accessible from the highway.",5.0
5048,Fun with Lego,"Went with colleagues (11 adults and no kids) to Legoland on a day tour organised by a tour agency. The theme park will only be fully open in 2014, but the current rides and activities can keep one occupied for at least 3 hours or so (taking into account the waiting time in the queues). Getting there:There are a few SG tour agencies offering chartered bus rides to Legoland, and there is also a new Causeway Link bus service (check website for details) ferrying visitors from Causeway or 2nd link to Legoland.Interesting to-do?- Rides: There are only a couple of rides that are roller-coaster style for the thrill-seekers, though they are very mild compared to the major ones at places like Disneyland and Universal Studios. - One can spend a bit of time (and quite a bit of money) trying to land basketballs in hoops, fish for little toy dragons, etc at the carnival-style booths. Looks easy but chances of winning are slim. Most attractive wins are the huge stuffed Angry Birds.- Food-wise: pricier than average but quality is just around average. - Photography: we spent most of our time taking pictures of the lovely figures made completely of Lego pieces. It's fascinating in a museum-style way. Mini Land is great - the builders added a touch of humour and life by including little daily-life scenes and activities into the setup (e.g. Spiderman trying to scale the Petronas tower with firefighters holding a safety net underneath, worshippers kneeling and prostrating themselves at a mosque, etc.)Purchases that can be made?Besides the main shop near the entrance, there are small shops throughout the park selling Lego sets with different themes. I was hoping to get some sets but found them to be too costly (might even be able to get better deals back in Sg). There are also plenty of little Lego souvenirs available. This is a really good place for the little ones..as for the adults like us- recommend to go with a group that likes Lego, and just have fun viewing, touching and imagining with the colourful blocks..=)",4.0
5049,Fun for adults too,"I went there with my 2 sisters and a friend. We first had lunch at the Mall of Medini that is directly across from the park's main entrance. We went on a Saturday and surprisingly the lines for all the rides that we went on were not long. We waited about 20 to 30 minutes for the more popular rides like the Boat School and the Lost Kingdom Adventure. However, it was quite disappointing that when we watched the 4D movie at the Lego Studios, the movie suddenly froze and we were told to leave the studio. The different lego characters and buildings were interesting and innovative. There were unique lego characters/buildings at each area of the park and Miniland is amazing. I was amazed at how they can build those miniature planes, buildings, vehicles etc using lego bricks. I think the map can be improved by not only providing a picture of the key attraction but also a name/symbol to indicate that this is the key attraction at this area of the park. Water fountains can be installed throughout the park and more areas with fans will be great. The park is mostly outdoor and it can get really hot at times.We had dinner at the Market Restaurant and even though it is a little expensive, the food is delicious. We tried the beef ball noodle soup, the meatball spaghetti, minestrone soup, and apple crumble and we enjoyed our dinner at the park. The staff were friendly and the park is clean. I had a great day at Lego land. It was fun and I recommend this park to everyone.",4.0
5050,It is for the children!,"My review for Legoland Malaysia is long. Beside sharing some of my observation and experience and pricing, I also include, at the end, some direction, parking, eateries, baby care information which I hope it will be helpful for first timers. Note: Mall of Medini is just in front of Legoland. It is not a big mall but spacious with eateries as well as shops. Should you need some assistance from Police, there is a police post, near Legoland.Anyway, we are a family of 5 - 2 adults with 3 children (age 6, 4 n 1). Went there for two straight (non peak) days. Yes, bought annual pass. If you bought the annual pass and are first time there, make sure you fill up a form (each for each paying members in your family) before going to the counter. I am not sure if you can down load the form in advance. But do contact Legoland Malaysia and asked if you can get a copy. This will save you sometime when you get your pass at the counter. We spent about 5-10 min filling up the forms!If you are adults or teenagers, go there during non-peak periods. Legoland is built for children 2-12 years old. So, don't expect much for the older ones. Nevertheless, the experience to go one can be great if you don't have to wait long for some fun rides. And start your fun on the LEFT side of the park (after entering). The rides are more for people above 110cm. You can expect to see some really neat lego structures. There is the Build n Test area where I saw many grown-ups happily building objects in an air-conditioning environment.Since Legoland Malaysia is newly build, it is clean and spacious on non-peak periods. The staffs are very friendly, smiley and all those we encountered can said English. Not going to write about each rides or play area, but will highlight a few ones:If you have young children that are less than 110 cm or less than 6 years old, I recommend to start your fun on the RIGHT side (after entering). The first place to go is Lego City. My 4 year old love the Junior Driving School. On the second day, he went to play like 10 times. The staffs just help us to keep an eyes on him. This play area is covered.The other driving school is for kids above 6 years old. It is just next to the junior school. The class is in a covered area but the actual driving site is not. Note: it cost RM 25 for the kids driver license. We didn't get one, it look quite similar to the annual pass - all yellow in color. Not available at the Junior drivers school.Fire Station in Lego City is a TIRING area! There are a few vehicles - fire trucks, police car etc in a row. One got to complete with others by pumping our vehicle to move forwards. Jump down and then pump up the water to put out the fire. Jump back into the vehicle and move/pump it back to the starting point. I went with my 6 n 4 and I basically did the pumping all by myself. it is VERY tiring.Power Tower - another area where you need your arm muscle. My husband went with the oldest one, (height restriction doesn't allow my other 2 younger ones to go on). My 6 year old couldn't pull the chair up, so Daddy got to pull their weight plus the chair weight up to the top. Good to try once.4-D theater is another air-conditional area. They have a few shows. Day 1, Daddy took the 2 older ones to watch the race cars show. Day 2, my oldest one went with me to watch the rocket one. They told us baby not allow because of the loud sound and water effect. I agreed that the sound is too loud for a baby.Build & Test is another air-conditional area that my children love to play. They build simple cars and had them race down a track. Even the 1 year old played on it. There are lots of tables and chairs around. On each table, lego are provide FREE of charge. But in order to get the wheels, you must sign them (FREE) out/in at the counter. Saw many adults having fun here too.Body Dryers. Have you hear of it? It cost RM5 to dry your body. They are located near rides that will get you wet. So, if you don't feel like packing extra cloth, here is one solution. I didn't try it, not sure how good they are. Last but not least, reserve your visit to MiniLand last. Miniland, right in front of the entrance is a place where you can see professionally build lego structures of selected Asia countries.. It is a non-covered area. There are some covered area where you can have lunch there but to see all minitures, you will have to walk away from this covered area. So, best to wait till after 4pm to visit. It is less hot at that time and after this area, you can go out the exit of the park right away. Driving direction from Singapore after entering from Tuas Check points. here are a few points:- Go straight until you see Green Sigh Boards (on the left) that said where to turn for Legoland.- Look for the word, Legoland,  in the brown rectangles on the green sign boards. - Exit 312 has left and right split off after the turn. After turning off on Exit 312, please merge into the highway on RIGHT. There isn't a sign board to show which way to go. - At the 1st round-about, take the second exit. You will see a sign said, ""Kota Iskandar"". There is a green sign (before the round-about) that said LegoLand, but it is hidden behind a tree. - We came from east of Singapore, the drive took us about 1hr 45 min each way, without traffic and smooth check point experience.- When returning to Singapore, after the parking lots, turn left. Follow signs that said ""TUAS"". - Also note is the charge to enter and leaving the Malaysia Check Point, currently, is RM7.50 each way. If you have Touch n Go card, make sure you have enough cash in it.Next, Parking information:There are 3 zones for parking which we saw, Zon 1, 2, 3. Zon 1 & 2 are on the left side of Legoland. They shared a common covered walk way to the main enterance for Legoland.Zon 3 is next to Mall of Medini. It also has a covered walk way to the mall.All 3 Zon are well lighted at night.The parking spaces are non-covered, marked with red brick on the ground and cars park on stones. We parked at Zon 1 as well as Zon 3. You will see Zon 3 first (if you come from Singapore direction). The sign also said that it is for Mall of Medini's parking. I recommend this parking Zon.This parking is next to the Mall. Follow the covered walk way to 2 escalators. You will end up in the mall itself. The mall is spacious and have lots of eateries.Shops on left & right n middle with a fountain area in the middle of the mall.At the other end of the mall is Legoland main entrance.Probably take only 2-3 minutes walk from one end of the mall to the other end if you don't stop n look.(Don't forget to check out which eateries you want to have your lunch/dinner at!)If you parked at Zon 1 or 2, you still have to walk, under covered path, but no shops in sight. The distance to Legoland is about the same as parking in Zon 3. It is a little cooler to be in the mall than walking this walk way.Food places:You can find food places in Legoland. But the price aren't cheap. Kid meal starts from RM15. We bought 2 kid meals - chicken nugget and fish fingers, and chicken rice. Each kid meal has 6 pieces meat, come with a cup of fruits and a small pack (around 125ml) of Rebina. Adult meal starts from RM 18.Soda is the cheaper drink on the menu, RM 4.50.Total cost about RM50 for our lunch.My recommendation of food:Go out of the park and head to Mall of Medini.At least 10 eateries are opened currently. There are Thai, Japanese, Indian, Chinese, KFC, Burger King, El Migros, King Cafe as well as the little stand-alones in the middles of the mall that sells varieties choices of food. We ate at King Cafe on Day 1 for dinner .Their main dish range from RM 8.90 (local delight) to RM25.00 (for steak). They also reduce price for bundle bakery items near closing time. Items can sell for buy 2 get 1 free to buy 2 for reduce price.We ordered a fried rice, mee hoon and crispy noodle, 2 apple juices and 2 waters (water not free, 50 cents each). Total cost include 6% fee is RM 42.90. If it isn't for the 2 apple juices (total cost of RM 11.80), this meal will be way cheaper than eating in Legoland itself. We also ate at the Chinese place, I think it is called Gu Ling in Chinese. Had Mee Suan, Crispy chicken set (come with a big chicken, sweet potatoes and a drink) and chicken rice with tou fu (also come with drink). Total bill RM 33. One of our favorite places to have a nice cold drink is Cool Blog in the middle of the mall, in front of the water fountains. There are other cold drink store but their price is a little higher than Cool Blog. The price start from RM 2.50. We had smoothies which cost RM3.50 for about 500ml. Toppings (such as black pearl) is addition 60 cents. A cup of (similar size) sluggish in Legoland is selling at RM10.00.Toilets in LegoLand:Situated next to most of the restaurants/cafes. And toilets are all air-conditioned!There are spacious Family Toilets room. No diaper changing table in it. A long hand wash area which can be coverted to changing table easy but without the safety belt. If you are looking for a place to nurse baby, Family Toilet Room may be one option. But note, there is no chair to sit. There is a baby care room next to Build & Test. Diaper changing table in all the toilets, has a hand basin with soap nearby.Lastly, we were there from opening hours to closing time on Day 1. Because we had a long drive home, we ate our dinner at the mall. The children all falls asleep on the way home. Just make sure they used toilet if your drive is long or you are heading into traffic jam. And on Day 2, we spent only 5 hours there as it is a Friday. We wanted to pass the immigration check point before a build-up. Also to avoid traffic during rush hour. I hope you and/or your children will enjoy LegoLand Malaysia as much as my children did!Have fun and be safe!",4.0
5051,Fun place,"Variety of entertainment,clean and serene,pleasurable enough for the adults not to be bored but not for the true thrill seekers.My advice is to wait until the Water park and resort to open",4.0
5052,A day of fun,"It was a fun day (Monday) that we spent with our 5 yr old son @ Legoland Malaysia. We arrived by car pretty early and was surprised at the no. of car park lots available.. the Zone 2 parking lots are the closest to the park, in my option with covered shelter (in case of rainy days).. even though you could park at the shopping area (there's a mall there)...The place was pleasingly empty when we arrived.. and we had little hassle as we bought the annual passes. There are strollers and wheel-chair for rental (I think it's RM 20 for a single stroller... they have double stroller as well) and locker for rental inside the park near the entrance.Inside.. the place was a ""paradise"" for my 5-year old with more than plenty to entertain him.. there were activities specially for children (like jousting on the horse, driving of car) as well as activities for the adults also.. and some which parents can do with their children.The food was ok (the meatball spagetthi's portion) was super huge, though I overheard from the neighbouring table that the chicken rice is too bland. there are western and asian food on the menu (i think same menu for the various places)... Though eating at the Farmer's market near the train station is the best - air con and comfortable table and chairs.The hind side was that drinks throughout the park are a bit more expensive.. (which was more needed due to the hot weather).. The miniland was amazing.. but for photography purposes.. the opening and closing hours are the best... the mid-day heat is a little too much to bear... a good thing they have, however, throughout the park is the Photography people who would help us take group shots.. both on our cameras as well as their.. you can also purchase theirs at the brick shop at least 30min after the shot were taken...Overall, the time spent at legoland quickly went by.. though there are a few attractions not fully operational.. I think it is worth the ticket price since besides food and drink and the optional carnival booth games that are more ""pasar malam"" styled and theme, all the other activities and attractions are free...",4.0
5053,Terrific day out at Legoland Malaysia,"We went to Legoland 10 days after it opened and found it to be in excellent condition and well staffed. The attractions were in excellent working order, but a few of them were closed on the day due to maintanence which was frustrating even though the open later, and we're closed the following day. We were reassured that they would be open again later but we stayed the day and didn't get to them. Apart from a few 5 minute waits we went onto just about every ride straight away. Many of the rides our two boys who are tall 5 year olds loved it so much they went multiple times. We are not big theme park people but this was fun, and all the staff were really nice. The mini Lego land area was brilliant and had obviously had some thought for design and interest. A lot of the displays had moving vehicles and water features. We took our own food but the food appeared to be priced as would be expected in a theme park. The place will have a water park area also in 2013 which is when we will return most probably. If you book a week in advance online you get a discount.",5.0
5054,Good fun for family of smaller children,"Take the SecondLink from Singapore and it is easily accesible fron the North-South highway by car. There is a walk from the nearest road/carpark to the entrance of about 400 metres. The attractions are interesting and fun. Target market will be the younger children. The rides are not thrilling enough for the older kids or young adults. I found it ot be an enjoyable day out. Our group conisted of senior citizens and they had an easy time of walking around although there are not enough covered seats for them to rest. And most of the restaurants ran out of mineral water by late afternoon, leaving only soft and sweet drinks available. So bring your own if you do not want to run out of water.",3.0
5055,Great day for the whole family!,"We (my husband and two sons 8 & 9) visited Legoland on the Grand Opening day, September 15, 2012 which was also my son's 8th birthday! We were prepared for large crowds and plenty of chaos but were pleasantly surprised. The park was by no means overcrowded and was very well organised. We were able to enjoy all of the rides and interactive activities which were offered. We were all very impressed by the huge display of lego in the centre of the park where almost every famous landmark and other day-to-day sightings were represented. They were absolutely amazing! As is common in most theme parks, the food and drinks offered were on the pricey side however there was a good selection on offer. Some of the rides had a few technical issues in the morning which is to be expected on the opening day, however all were open in the afternoon and were worth the wait.The park itself is located about 30 minutes from the main town of Johor Bahru. We combined our visit with a legoland package offered by the Pulai Springs Resort which included a family ticket and  transfers. The park is about 30 minutes away from the Pulai Springs Resort.We would highly recommend a visit to this park if you get the chance!",5.0
5056,Great place for photos but not for thrill seekers,"If you're the type who seeks adrenaline rush at a themepark, then Legoland it's not for you. It's targeted for the younger children or Lego fans who probably love taking photos. But I do welcome it with open arms as now Singaporeans have another nearby themepark aside from Universal Studios Singapore, Genting and Berjaya Times Square. To get to Legoland Malaysia, you can take Causeway Link bus LG1 from JB Sentral (40 mins for RM4) or Causeway Link bus JPO2 from Second Link (20mins for RM$4.20). WTS travel provides a coach too which departs from Singapore flyer in the morning ($20 for two-way).Legoland is divided into 7 sections which combines learning and play. Personally, I spent more time at Lego technic and Lego kingdom as the rides were the most exciting of the lot (Dragon, Dragon apprentice and Project X). Mindstorms is a must stop attraction when you're at Lego technic as you'll be amused by robotics as you control robots to complete missions. You do need to 'book' a class though so i'd suggest doing it first thing before you explore other things.At Imagination area, you can build your own lego cars and pit it against other cars. There's also a play area for you to build the most earthquake-resistant building. I think this hands-on play area is great to not only escape the heat but actually relive your memory of playing with those colourful bricks. Go wild, anything is possible here. Also, stop at the Lego Studios for a 4d movie treat!It can get pretty hot at the park so do remember to apply lots of sunscreen and hydrate yourself. But you can retreat to the Land of Adventure area to drench yourself at Pharoah's Revenge where you dive down a water slide (the more people on the boat, the wetter you'll be!) or shoot some evil things in Lost Kingdom (this reminds me of the Buzz Lightyear game in Disneyland HK). The latter is pretty fun as you can track your score and challenge your partner.Head over to the photographer's paradise, Miniland, for a breather. Housing intricate miniatures of famous landmarks of places in Asia, do remember to look closely at the lego men for some interesting positions they are in. One can only wonder in awe at how much effort and time was spent on those sculptures. While there surrounding area of Legoland seems to be in the midst of being built up, there is a mall opposite (Mall of Medini) housing a wide selection of food, in case you're not too fond of themepark food.There are no hotels nearby currently but it has been said to be in the pipelines, together with a water park in Legoland. Looks like I'll be stopping by for another visit when those are done.",3.0
5057,Kid's Theme Park,"It's located in Nusajaya, where near second link to Singapore.Travelling by car from north-south highway is pretty easy by just followed the signboardJB sighboard directions are clearer than KL and useful but not repeatedShutter bus services are available in Tune Hotel and Larkin Bus Terminal.So all the facilities inside are designed for family and kids.The roller coaster are relatively shorter and considered as ""kid level""The entertaintainment faci themes are so ""universal studio""The land of adventure are the shadow of jurassic park in Universal Studio Singapore (USS)The show in stage of lego and 4D cinema are really really childish for meIt is a good place for family for kids but not couple or teenagersThere are burger king, KFC outside the park, u can just get a stamp on your hand and leave the park temporaly for your lunch, of course u can have your meal inside the park but the choices are limited and slightly more expensive but considered reasonable compare to USS#MYKAD holder will get a RM30 discount on daypass purchase at the counter#RM35 discount is subjected for 7 days advance fixed date daypass purchasing#Legoland waterpark and Legoland resort is still underconstructionConclusion, USS>Sunway Lagoon>Legoland Johor>Genting Theme Park",3.0
5058,Fantastic 2 days,"Went with my wife and 4 kids - ages 11, 10, 6 and 1.Really fantastic - staff are great from the beginning, entering in the park and all way round.I would say the car parking needs improving but that will come with time.The park is well laid out and always has plenty of shade. Great rides for all ages and kids will not get bored. Queues are not bad at all and we went on both Saturday and Sunday.Invest in the annual pass and go a few times - well worth the money.Around the park if you have small kids are baby air-con rooms you can rest in.One piece of advice on entering the park is a MyNews shop - buy your drinks and snacks there.  Very cheap like all shops in Malaysia. Once in the park a bottle of fizzy drink is RM6 and food very expensive.It can get very hot so go later on in the afternoon.",5.0
5059,Please keep the restrooms clean,A great day out. Our 6 year old loved all the rides especially The Driving School. Thought the food and beverage options were good and reasonably priced. Only disappointment was the restrooms ...pretty filthy which was surprising given the park has only been open little over a week...,3.0
5060,"Quality family outing, great experience for kids.","Located a little out of the city for better traffic dispersion, ample parking, good facilities throughout the park for seniors, kids and the disabled. Very friendly staff who constantly greet you with a smile and willing to help. Great food at affordable prices in the park as well. Good, clean fun for the kids that provokes imagination. A truly international level theme park in Malaysia. First of its kind!",5.0
5061,Perfect for families with young kids,"For anyone who's been wishing for a Universal Studios or a Disneyland in Malaysia, then rejoice, for Legoland Malaysia is the closest thing to it! We went with my kids aged 2 yrs and 4.5 yrs.The attractions: There's about 40  rides currently spread out over 7 zones with everything from roller coasters for older kids and playgrounds for younger kids. Many of the stuff you can do here are educational besides being great fun! My 2-yr-old couldn't do most of the rides but she wasn't complaining because she had fun at the two playgrounds there -- The Shipyard (outdoor) and Duplo Playtown (covered). My 4.5-yr-old, meanwhile, had a blast at the Build and Test section of Imagination Zone. The 4D Theatre and Miniland are worth a mention here as well. Some of the rides will allow younger kids on board with an accompanying adult (parent/older sibling).Food: There are plenty of restaurants/cafes for the family to grab a bite. Food selection is mostly Western with a few local (Asian) choices. The salad, pizza and pasta standards were available, of course.Shopping: Great selection of Lego products. Price-wise, they were priced the same as at shopping malls in other parts of Malaysia, as far as I could tell. The Lego souvenirs are pricey but still I'd recommend getting something to remind you of the trip.Facilities: The toilets were large and spacious, they also have toilets for families and baby changing rooms. There are at least two suraus (Muslim praying rooms) there -- one at The Beginning and the other at Imagination zones.Parking: Plenty of parking availableTips: 1. If you're going with fairly young children like mine, my advise is to visit the Legoland Malaysia website to plan your tour of the park -- they list the height restrictions for each ride there, so you know which rides to go for and which to pass. Basically, the imagination Zone is great for younger kids.2. Plan a mix of outdoor and indoor activities because the heat there can be unbearable. Indoor activities are like Buildt and Test, the 4D Theatre, etc.3. Heat: I would recommend parents of young children to bring strollers for their kids. Legoland Malaysia has these cute blue strollers that can seat either one or two children, but I guess these would run out fast. Also, think about how to keep your kids cool because the place is HOT -- portable fan, lots of water, dress light, etc.4. Driving: We drove our own car to Legoland and it was quite confusing. We were not familiar with Johor highways and had to detour several times. A better option is to stay with a hotel/resort that offers transfers. Many Johor hotels have Legoland packages that include accommodations, some meals, tickets to Legoland and transfers. That would be good value-for-moeny, I think.5. Accommodation: We stayed at Pulai Springs Resort which was great for families; it was about 30 minutes drive to Legoland. They have apartments which was spacious for kids to run about. Nice facilities -- golf course, a mini zoo, pools. The only downside was the food -- didn't like the buffet breakfast spread. However, Pulai Springs now has a Legoland package. Hope this was helpful!",5.0
5062,Awesome Experience at Legoland,"My kids were very excited and loved it very much. It was an awesome and fabuluos experience for them. The roller coster was very fast and its meant for those who are really brave. Miniland is wonderful.p Tips: 1) Rent the stroller even if your kids are 7 years old. This would definitely be a help as weather is very hot and can lessen their tiredness. 2) if you purchase annual pass, do go later in the evening when its cooler. 3) Do not miss the driving school and boating school. 4) Do try the food there. Its on the high side but its worth it.",5.0
5063,Thinking of buying an annual pass? Think again.,"Just got back from Legoland. I feel that the place is rather sparse with the few attractions too spaced out. Perhaps the management wants to give the impression that it is a big theme park but the result is patrons like us have to walk long distance between the attractions under the hot sun without any sheltered walkway.  Many of the rides are also in the sun and it's very very hot.  I reached Legoland at 10 am and by 12.30pm, I could see that many people were literally burnt out with their faces burning red as a result of the sun. It's just too hot. The trees were just planted so they were too small to offer any shade. My advice to those who are going. Bring a stroller to put things, put on lots of sunblock lotion. bring lots of water, big umbrellas and snacks, sunglasses and hats. Oh, there are also not many toilets around. So be sure to visit one when you have the chance. And plan to stay not more than 2-3 hours. After that, everyone will be in a grouchy mood because of the heat.Would I go back again? Yes, but only because I have already bought the annual passes but I will wait a few months until all the attractions are opened.This is my personal opinion. Do go and try it out and make your own assessment.",2.0
5064,Rare theme park that combines fun & learning,"When I was a child, the surest way to turn me off any fun activity was if it were labelled ""educational"".  The creators of Legoland clearly share that point of view as they have subtly incorporated elements of learning in their attractions without spoiling the fun for patrons.In Lego Academy, for example, kids can take a 45 minute class in robotics. At the Driving School, kids can drive on roads that feature real traffic features (the cars are not guided on a track like Disneyland's Autopia, mind you). There are places where you can unleash your inner architect by playing with Lego bricks, and the Miniland displays the best of Asian landmarks in miniature, built entirely of Legos.A theme park, after all, should contain attractions based on a ""theme"", and where this is concerned, Legoland has succeeded in providing rides and activities that are based and capitalises on Lego products.Almost all the attractions were designed with children in mind, and there are even a few that excludes older kids. That being the case, Legoland is not your usual adrenaline-pumping theme park, and expectations have to set accordingly (although I must say a couple of the roller coasters were intense).As some reviewers mentioned, it is hot, so bring an umbrella for shade. The park does not have many covered walkways like Universal Studios Singapore, although I did notice many trees that should provide natural shade once mature.We bought annual passes for RM195 (adult) each through a promotion, which means that we would have covered the cost of day tickets with just 2 visits. Try to look out for these deals.We visited on the Saturday a week after opening, and teething problems were still there. Because of a technical glitch, a few rides only opened at 11.00 am. The parking bays and rows are unmarked, so we had to take careful note of our car's position. Apparently there's a F&B discount for annual passholders, but not all the cashiers alert you to this fact. But these are minor issues which should be resolved soon.We had a fun day out, and are looking forward to making full use of our annual passes! Syabas, Legoland Malaysia!",5.0
5065,The park is still new but worthy of visit especially for small kids,"We visited Legoland on a private event which sponsored by my company. The rides are 70% tailored for kids under 12 years old and 30% thrilling rides for 12 years and above. There is a Lego workshop for 8 years old kids and above, which is about 45 mins per session, kids can learn and explore the insight mechanical of how lego is made. Kids are happy to play those small rides as the rides are tailored according to kids size. The Miniland is amazing to show most of the landmark of Malaysia. The weather is very hot due to not many trees since the park is new. Food is truly expensive inside the park. Roasted chicken rice is RM 16.80. Mineral water is RM 2.50 (cheapest), Ribena is RM 5 and soda is RM 4.80, slushies is RM 10! Please bring more water (must be in water tubbler) as you will drink a lot due to hot weather. Please read the map and queue up the rides according to your top priority list. Some of the game may be available and do not need to queue up long due to only small kids are allowed. So when you enter the park, queue up the popular rides first.Johor Premium Outlet is about 15mins distance from Legoland. You can explore JPO if have time, it is easy to find and along the highway.",4.0
5066,Legoland is wonderful,"Bring your hat and sun umbrella, it's hot hot hot, not much shade. You can take in your own food and drink, I don't think they check bags.  Bring strollers for kids, as they get tired of walking around in the hot sun. Why not go later in the day, less people and a lot cooler.  Around 5pm we went on many rides repeatedly without having to queue. It was great fun even for me.I think the park stays open till later ie 7pm, but do check that.  There's a great covered playground for kids towards the back of the park, it's really worth as a parent, just sitting in the shade of the playground and let your kids have fun playing. My kids loved this playground, they discovered that it made lots of funny noises. If you are feeling a little too hot, head for the 4D show near the same playground. It's so worth it.  It had special effects and even some real snow fall from the ceiling, so refreshing and cool, I could have stayed for another show.  The car parking is free, but it is a long long walk to the entrance. So if you have elderly people, you might consider dropping them off nearer to the entrance before parking the car.  The merchandise shop has really high quality gifts, you will find it difficult not to buy something, but the prices are not for the local Malaysian market.  Despite this, we still bought some great lego.  Restaurants in the park are good, but make sure you secure a table inside with air conditioning before you line up to order your food.  Oh and the toilets are clean and very cold.",5.0
5067,Awesome,"Nice place for children. Make sure you bring water, food (is expensive bout RM22 for a meal), sunglasses and extra clothes. Nice view to take pictures.",5.0
5068,Heaven for Lego lovers,4 adults visited Legoland. The place is packed before opening hour. It's the second day after their Grand Opening. We were given priority access through back door since I owned a travel agency in Kuala Lumpur. Thanks to the Sales personnel. This themepark is meant for kids. More rides and attractions for kids. It's good for parents and kids interaction as most rides are accessible for both children and adults. Waterpark is coming up in 2013 whilst there will be a Lego hotel launching in 2014. Malaysia's weather is on humid side and a cap/umbrella is necessary during the visit. However there are a few air-conditioned areas for kids and parents.,5.0
